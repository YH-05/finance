       "  'content': 'Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg plans to ramp up his company\\'s spending on artificial intelligence in 2026. Wall Street seems fine with that strategy.\\n\\nIn its fourth-quarter earnings report on Wednesday, Meta beat on the top and bottom lines while also revealing that its AI-related capital expenditures this year will be between $115 billion and $135 billion. That\\'s nearly twice the amount Meta spent on capex last year, when the company revamped its AI unit.\\n\\nAlthough investors have previously expressed concern about Meta\\'s AI spending spree, they took comfort in the company\\'s latest results, which showed 24% year-over-year revenue growth, driven by online ads. Meta shares, which trailed the market last year, popped as much as 10% in after-hours trading.\\n\\n\"As we plan for the future, we will continue to invest very significantly in infrastructure to train leading models and deliver personal super intelligence to billions of people and businesses around the world,\" Zuckerberg told analysts during the earnings call.\\n\\nZuckerberg was referring to Meta\\'s ambitious data center buildouts intended to anchor both current and future AI projects.\\n\\nMeta finance chief Susan Li told analysts that the company continues to be \"capacity constrained,\" meaning it needs more computing power to further improve its core ad business while also providing its AI team the necessary resources to create more advanced models and products.\\n\\n\"Our teams have done a great job ramping up our infrastructure through the course of 2025, but demands for compute resources across the company have increased even faster than our supply,\" Li said.\\n\\nZuckerberg said 2026 will be a major year for AI, with Meta\\'s investments geared towards supporting his mission for \"building personal super intelligence.\"\\n\\nWhether Meta will have much by way of new AI products that can generate revenue remains a major question, and one Zuckerberg hasn\\'t clearly answered.\\n\\n\"I mean, we\\'re going to roll out new products over the course of the year,\" Zuckerberg said on the call. \"I think the important thing is, we\\'re not just launching one thing, and we\\'re building a lot of things.\"\\n\\nPerhaps Zuckerberg\\'s biggest swing last year was the $14.3 billion investment in Scale AI, which brought founder and CEO Alexandr Wang and some of his top engineers and researchers to Meta. Wang is now leading Meta\\'s TBD AI unit, which has been testing a new frontier model code-named Avocado that\\'s intended to be a successor to the company\\'s Llama family of models, CNBC reported.\\n\\n\"I expect our first models will be good but, more importantly, will show the rapid trajectory that we\\'re on,\" Zuckerberg said Wednesday. \"And then I expect us to steadily push the frontier over the course of the year as we continue to release new models.\"\\n\\nAsked on the call why Meta needs to develop its own powerhouse AI foundation model, Zuckerberg said it\\'s important because Meta is a \"deep technology company.\"\\n\\nMeta can\\'t risk being \"constrained to what others in the ecosystem are building or allow us to build,\" he said, adding that controlling a model allows you to help \"shape the future of these products.\"\\n\\nIn the meantime, online advertising still accounts for the overwhelming majority of Meta\\'s revenue. As long as that business continues to dominate in mobile, exceed expectations and throw off billions of dollars of cash a quarter, Zuckerberg is likely to get plenty of leeway to pursue his AI ambitions.\\n\\n**WATCH**: Meta and Google go to trial over child safety — here\\'s what\\'s at stake.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Microsoft shares fell 7% in extended trading on Wednesday after the software maker posted slowing cloud growth.\\n\\nHere\\'s how the company performed in comparison with LSEG consensus:\\n\\n**Earnings per share:**$4.14 adjusted vs. $3.97 expected**Revenue:**$81.27 billion vs. $80.27 billion expected\\n\\nWith respect to guidance, Microsoft called for $80.65 billion to $81.75 billion in fiscal third-quarter revenue. The middle of the range was $81.2 billion, meeting the LSEG consensus of $81.19 billion. The company\\'s forecast for quarterly Azure cloud growth was 37% to 38% at constant currency. The StreetAccount consensus was 37.1%.\\n\\nThe company\\'s implied fiscal third-quarter operating margin is 45.1%, below StreetAccount\\'s 45.5% consensus. Operating expenses will include investments in artificial intelligence computing capacity and talent.\\n\\nFor the fiscal second quarter, which ended on Dec. 31, Microsoft\\'s revenue grew 16.7% year over year, according to a statement. Net income, at $38.46 billion, or $5.16 per share, was up from $24.11 billion, or $3.23 per share, in the same quarter a year earlier. Adjusted earnings exclude impact from investments in OpenAI. The company\\'s gross margin was the narrowest it\\'s been in three years, coming in just over 68%.\\n\\nRevenue from Azure and other cloud services grew 39%, compared with 40% growth in the fiscal first quarter. Analysts surveyed by StreetAccount and CNBC had expected 39.4% and 38.9% growth, respectively.\\n\\nThe company reported $9.97 billion in other income, compared with other expense of $2.29 billion in the same quarter a year ago. The swing comes three months after OpenAI announced a restructuring that involved its for-profit arm becoming a public-benefit corporation. Microsoft saw a decrease in its proportionate ownership of OpenAI, yielding a dilution gain.\\n\\nAt year end, the company\\'s commercial remaining performance obligation, a measurement of unearned revenue and amounts that will be recognized as revenue later, stood at $625 billion, up some 110%. That\\'s thanks to OpenAI\\'s $250 billion cloud commitment with Microsoft during the quarter. Microsoft said 45% of commercial remaining performance obligation is tied to OpenAI, with the remainder growing 28%.\\n\\n\"The backlog is really good, but the disclosure that OpenAI is 45% of their backlog, it goes back to the situation where, Can OpenAI achieve these financial goals to pay Oracle, Microsoft and many of the providers,\" Jefferies analyst Brent Thill said on CNBC\\'s Closing Bell Overtime.\\n\\nThill brought up the OpenAI revenue concentration on a conference call with analysts.\\n\\nThe rest of the commercial remaining performance obligation is \"larger than most peers, more diversified than most peers, and frankly, I think we have super high confidence in it,\" said Amy Hood, Microsoft\\'s finance chief. She said Microsoft remains OpenAI\\'s \"provider of scale.\"\\n\\nCommercial bookings growth, which tracks quarterly activity, surged to 230% from 112% in the fiscal first quarter.\\n\\nMicrosoft\\'s Intelligent Cloud segment that includes Azure cloud infrastructure produced $32.91 billion in revenue, up nearly 29% and more than the $32.40 billion consensus among analysts surveyed by StreetAccount.\\n\\nThe Productivity and Business Processing segment delivered $34.12 billion in revenue, which was up about 16% and higher than StreetAccount\\'s $33.48 billion consensus. The unit contains Office productivity software, Dynamics business management software and LinkedIn.\\n\\nMicrosoft now has 15 million seats for its Microsoft 365 Copilot add-on for commercial productivity software subscriptions. Investors have been paying attention to the adoption of Microsoft 365 Copilot as a way to increase revenue from each user. Until this point, Microsoft had not talked about the number of people who have access.\\n\\nCopilot has room to grow. Microsoft now has over 450 million paid commercial Microsoft 365 seats.\\n\\nThe More Personal Computing segment, featuring Windows, Xbox, Surface and Bing, contributed $14.25 billion in revenue. That was down about 3% and below the $14.38 billion StreetAccount consensus. Technology industry researcher Gartner said PC shipments rose 9.3% in the quarter, with support for the Windows 10 operating system ending in October.\\n\\nGaming revenue declined 9.5%. Microsoft said it took an unspecified impairment charge in that division during the quarter. Former Microsoft Xbox executive Mike Ybarra described the gaming unit\\'s strategy as \"confusing\" in an X post that he posted and later deleted in October.\\n\\nLike its cloud rivals such as Amazon, Microsoft has been building data centers filled with special-purpose chips that can run generative AI models. Microsoft also pays for capacity from CoreWeave and Nebius in the form of leases.\\n\\nMicrosoft\\'s capital expenditures and finance leases in the quarter came to $37.5 billion, up 66%. Analysts polled by Visible Alpha had expected $34.31 billion.\\n\\n\"All up, we added nearly one gigawatt of total capacity this quarter alone,\" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said on the call.\\n\\nThe company\\'s customer demand continues to outstrip supply, Hood said.\\n\\n\"Therefore, we must balance the need to have our incoming supply better meet growing Azure demand with expanding first-party AI usage across services like M365 Copilot and GitHub Copilot, increasing allocations to R&D teams to accelerate product innovation and continued replacement of end-of-life server and networking equipment,\" she said.\\n\\nDuring the quarter, Microsoft said it will raise the prices of commercial Office productivity software subscriptions, and Anthropic announced plans to buy $30 billion in cloud services and contract up to a gigawatt of additional computing capacity from Microsoft.\\n\\nIn the past three months, Microsoft stock has fallen about 11%, while the S&P 500 index has gained 1%, with investors pondering the risk of generative AI models hurting the growth prospects for traditional software.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The Federal Reserve wrapped up a two-day policy meeting Wednesday, delivering pretty much what the market expected and no major surprises from Chair Jerome Powell\\'s news conference. Here are five things worth remembering:\\n\\n- The decision: To no one\\'s surprise, the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee held its benchmark funds rate in a range between 3.5%-3.75%. The move broke a string of three straight cuts and could be a harbinger of a central bank not of a mind to ease again anytime soon.\\n- The dissents: As has been the custom for the past six months or so, multiple committee members broke ranks. This time, Governors Stephen Miran and Christopher Waller wanted another quarter percentage point cut. For Miran, though, it represented a bit of a turn as he deviated from three prior dissents in favor of half-point reductions.\\n- Powell\\'s post-meeting news conference was, in a word, a snoozer. On five separate occasions, the chair delivered variations on \"I have nothing for you on that\" to questions from reporters looking to bait him into commenting on the multiple political kerfuffles surrounding the Fed. Asked for the advice he would give his successor, Powell responded, \"Stay out of elected politics.\"\\n- From an economic standpoint, the FOMC statement and Powell\\'s commentary reflected expectations for solid growth, a near-term tariff-fueled boost for inflation that ultimately will recede, and a labor market in stasis as the labor force participation rate plus less immigration keep hiring in check while layoffs are also muted.\\n- And the markets yawned. With little to go on, the major stock averages closed little changed. Traders are still pricing in about a 60% chance of two additional, quarter percentage point rate cuts this year.\\n\\n### What they\\'re saying\\n\\n\"The Fed delivered a rate cut, but it arrived in a somewhat hawkish package. The Fed hasn\\'t shut the door on further cuts, but Chair Powell has raised the bar for further action. We expect the economy to grow at a solid pace next year, but it must be accompanied by job gains. The next round of jobs data may point to the exact opposite.\" — *Ellen Zentner, chief economic strategist for Morgan Stanley Wealth Management.*\\n\\n\"It\\'s détente at the Fed for now. But a shakeup is coming with the new Fed Chair in May.\" — *Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union*.\\n\\n\"Perspectively speaking, we saw this meeting as an affirmation from the Fed of what investors were already thinking. Labor conditions are not worsening, growth has accelerated and inflation has steadied for now. To put it in other words, policy rates are much closer to neutral against the current backdrop and it\\'s time for a long pause.\" — Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'One message came out loud and clear after the latest Federal Reserve meeting: Investors will have to wait longer for any interest rate cuts this year. The Fed\\'s first policy meeting of the year wrapped up Wednesday, with policymakers as expected leaving interest rates changed but starting to show a more hawkish consensus taking shape as the economic outlook improves. Central bank officials appeared to agree that growth and inflation are coming into better balance, removing the warning that there are \"downside risks to employment\" from their statement. Wednesday\\'s view was in marked contrast to worries over the job market at the end of last year, which raised hopes for further rate cuts. Within the politics of the board itself, only two dissents emerged, from Trump appointees Stephen Miran and Christopher Waller. That suggests policymakers are building a consensus at a time when the central bank\\'s independence has been thrown into question — and could potentially make any dovish attitude toward lower rates from the next Fed chair more challenging. Powell\\'s term as Fed chair ends in May. \"If jobs data doesn\\'t soften from here, a March cut is unlikely — and May isn\\'t a layup either,\" wrote Sonu Varghese, global macro strategist at Carson Group. \"Just two dissents underscores how tight the consensus is, which means any new Fed Chair that comes in (after Powell\\'s term is up) will have a hard time convincing other Fed members that rates need to go much lower, much less anywhere near President Trump\\'s 1% target.\" What\\'s more, easier financial conditions — from a stock market at record highs to a weak dollar — could help stimulate the economy even without the help of lower interest rates, reducing the need for looser monetary policy. \"Right now, what the Fed is observing is that the markets are easing for them,\" Jim Caron, cross-asset solutions chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, told CNBC\\'s Power Lunch on Wednesday. Market moves are \"what the Fed is basically judging their policy actions on,\" Caron continued. Investors are still pricing in two interest rate cuts for later this year, but odds of a reduction coming as soon as March or April have dropped sharply, according to the CME FedWatch Tool . The central bank\\'s benchmark overnight lending rate currently stands at 3.50% to 3.75%, and there are no Fed policy meetings in February or May.

You can subscribe **here.*\\n\\n## The big story\\n\\nChinese humanoid robots are on the verge of coming to the U.S. — before Elon Musk is ready to sell his Optimus machines.\\n\\nDuring my visits to China\\'s \"Silicon Valley,\" Shenzhen, over the last two years, I saw humanoid startup LimX Dynamics move from a bare-bones facility to a modern office tower with sweeping views — and bolder ambitions.\\n\\nNow, the company is exploring business collaborations in the U.S., founder Will Zhang told me in an exclusive interview last week. Just days earlier, the startup showed off its humanoid robot at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.\\n\\nIt\\'s all part of LimX\\'s push to go global through local partners, including investors.\\n\\nFirst on the roadmap is the Middle East. The startup has already secured its first foreign backer from the region, where LimX plans to start shipping humanoids this year, Zhang said.\\n\\nHe was unable to publicly share details on LimX\\'s new investors or the monetary amount, as the funding round is still in progress. The new round will multiply the startup\\'s valuation from its earlier Series A round, the startup said.\\n\\nLimX has raised $69.31 million as of July 2025, according to PitchBook, with backers including Alibaba, JD.com and Lenovo. Zhang declined to comment on IPO plans.\\n\\n\"More than money, I\\'m focused on local partnerships,\" Zhang said, noting plans to speak with more international investors in the next few months. Beyond the Middle East, he also sees potential in what he calls Europe\\'s large but fragmented market.\\n\\n## Competition with Elon Musk\\n\\nLimX is not alone. Several other Chinese humanoid robot companies such as Unitree showed off their humanoids at CES. They join an increasing number of China-based consumer electronics companies exploring the U.S. market.\\n\\nIt\\'s all a sign of how pressure is mounting for Elon Musk\\'s humanoid robot plans, not just from U.S. rival Figure AI but also from Chinese companies ramping up humanoid deliveries globally.\\n\\nLast year, about 13,000 humanoids were shipped worldwide, according to research firm Omdia. Chinese companies, led by Agibot, dominated the top five by shipments. Figure ranked seventh, while Tesla was ninth. Omdia said Tesla has shipped Optimus humanoid robot units to business clients, but not to the public yet.\\n\\nWith upbeat numbers from the Omdia report, Morgan Stanley last week doubled its forecast for China humanoid robot sales this year to 28,000 units, up from an earlier estimate of 14,000. The forecast only includes external sales.\\n\\n\"We expect sales to businesses to be the key driver this year, taking over from government, R&D and entertainment-related sales last year,\" equity analyst Shen Zhong said in the report. By 2050, the firm predicts China\\'s humanoid market could reach annual sales of 54 million units.\\n\\nAs for Optimus, Musk said last week at Davos that the robot wouldn\\'t start sales to the public until the end of 2027.\\n\\n## Ambitions to rank first globally\\n\\nLimX began delivering its humanoid robot, Oli, several months ago, Zhang said. The base model costs just 158,000 yuan ($22,660), using only LimX-made applications. A version that allows developers to integrate their own functions with the robot costs nearly twice that at 290,000 yuan.\\n\\nBut Zhang wants to be a global leader in the underlying technology, rather than just another Chinese company commercializing existing ideas.\\n\\n\"We don\\'t think it has to be that the U.S. leads and China follows\" in terms of tech innovation, he said.\\n\\nBefore founding LimX in 2022, Zhang was a tenured professor in electrical and computer engineering at Ohio State University.\\n\\nHis goal this year is to improve voice commands – eliminating the need for remote controls that still underpin many robot demos today, such as performing a somersault on command. Zhang aims to do this with agentic artificial intelligence, an advanced form of AI that can make a chain of decisions autonomously to complete a task.\\n\\nEarlier this month, LimX announced an agentic AI \"operating system\" called COSA, designed to enable robots to adjust body motion in real time, such as when handling tennis balls.\\n\\n2026 marks only the beginning of LimX\\'s three-year plan to deliver several thousand humanoid robots to the Middle East, primarily for research and development, and to build case studies on how the robots can perform services for humans. Plans for the U.S. haven\\'t yet been fleshed out.\\n\\nBut, Zhang said, rapid advances in the industry mean humanoid robots could be working alongside humans within five to 10 years. If all goes according to plan, those robots won\\'t just be in China, but deployed around the world.\\n\\n## Top TV picks on CNBC\\n\\nBenjamin Hung, Chairman of Hong Kong\\'s Financial Services Development Council, discussed how investors and businesses are reassessing the risk of heavy concentration in U.S. assets while rebalancing portfolios toward Asia, Greater China, gold, and alternative assets.\\n\\nHong Kong Financial Secretary Paul Chan said Hong Kong markets are becoming increasingly prominent on a global stage, attracting companies not just from Mainland China but also from Southeast Asia and the Middle East.\\n\\nKevin Sneader, President of APAC ex‑Japan at Goldman Sachs, spoke about investor appetite for AI driving flows into Asian markets, while noting key nuances for standouts such as China and South Korea.\\n\\n## Need to know\\n\\n**TikTok safe in the U.S. **The short-video app said it officially formed a joint venture that allows it to operate in the U.S., although China has yet to confirm the deal has its blessing.\\n\\n**China\\'s TCL buys Sony TVs. **The Chinese TV manufacturer is acquiring Sony\\'s home entertainment business through a joint venture that gives TCL a majority stake.

       "  'summary': 'Frank Cappelleri of CappThesis walks CNBC Pro readers through the charts of this railroad stock.',\n",
       "  'published': 'Wed, 28 Jan 2026 19:00:01 GMT',\n",
       "  'content': 'With the Federal Open Market Committee\\'s first meeting of the year this afternoon — followed by earnings from three of the \"Magnificent Seven\" — there\\'s no shortage of near-term catalysts today. This being the case, railroad stocks most likely are not a focus for many investors today — or really at any time. But just because a sector, group or stock isn\\'t among the most discussed, doesn\\'t mean we should ignore a potential opportunity. Thus, when a compelling chart pattern emerges, it always finds its way onto our radar. CSX Corporation (CSX) is one such example. CSX just made a new 52-week high after reporting earnings last week. As is clear, the stock has remained in a back-and-forth trend since being hit hard earlier in the year. And, along the way, it has continued to make higher highs and higher lows. Getting a true sense of a stock\\'s trend requires analyzing it across longer-term timeframes, as well. Zooming out to the weekly chart, we can see that CSX is now breaking out above an even larger bullish cup-and-handle pattern, which closely mirrors the daily setup. From this perspective, upside follow-through could soon put the early-2024 all-time highs back in the crosshairs. Needless to say, the presence of bullish patterns across two timeframes like this raises our conviction, compared with a setup that appears on only one. Further, sometimes it\\'s helpful to display multiple patterns on the same chart, provided it doesn\\'t become overly cluttered. In this case, doing so adds clarity by showing how both setups have developed over the past several months, while also highlighting the respective measured-move targets stemming from each breakout. On the daily timeframe, the shorter-term bullish pattern (shown in green) carries an upside target near 43. The larger cup-and-handle pattern (in blue), which has been forming for more than a year, points to a higher upside target near 48. The 33.5 area serves as a suggested stop-loss if one were to approach this as a trading idea, as a decisive move below that level would begin to challenge both bullish patterns. Best-case scenario, continued upside follow-through helps the stock move further away from its clear breakout zone just above 37, improving the overall risk-reward profile. Zooming out even further, it\\'s clear that this move is also unfolding within a much longer, five-year trading range. Importantly, that range has developed around CSX\\'s former highs, which could resolve as a long-term continuation pattern within an ongoing uptrend. The bottom line is that CSX has done a good job fighting back from last year\\'s downturn. And now, the stock is attempting to break out of bullish patterns on both the daily and weekly timeframes, while also getting closer to potentially triggering an even larger bullish formation on the monthly chart. Taken together, this represents a constructive technical development for a railroad stock that many investors may soon start to notice. — Frank Cappelleri Founder: https://cappthesis.com DISCLOSURES: None.

       "  'content': 'Microsoft topped revenue and earnings estimates in its fiscal 2026 second quarter. But shares slid Wednesday evening as Azure failed to deliver meaningful growth upside. In-line guidance did little to change that narrative, which has been hurting the stock. Revenue increased about 16% year over year to $81.28 billion, beating the Street consensus estimate of $80.26 billion, according to data from LSEG. Earnings per share increased 28% from last year to $4.14, ahead of the $3.97 estimate, LSEG data showed. Quarter EPS excluded $9.97 billion in other income related to OpenAI\\'s restructuring. MSFT 1Y mountain Microsoft 1 year Shares of Microsoft sank 6% in after-hours trading, extending a decline that began three months ago when the company reported a quarter that failed to meet a high bar, lacking material revenue growth upside despite a significant increase in capital expenditures. Bottom line Microsoft\\'s quarter on Wednesday evening did little to shake off that view. Azure revenue growth in fiscal Q2 did technically beat analyst estimates. Investors, however, wanted more growth to justify a 66% year-over-year increase in capital expenditures. Even with the company investing heavily in capacity, management said Azure customer demand exceeded available supply in its on-premises server business. What the company must figure out is how to better allocate its resources to maximize Azure monetization. That, at least, is what the market wants. What gives management the confidence to continue investing is a massive backlog that keeps getting bigger and bigger. Microsoft\\'s Commercial Bookings and Commercial Remaining Performance Obligation (RPO) is getting a lot of attention after hours. Bookings were up 230% year over year, driven by previously announced large Azure commitments from OpenAI and Anthropic. Commercial RPO increased 110% year over year to $625 billion, and roughly 25% of that is expected to be recognized in the next 12 months. While there\\'s some headline risk associated with OpenAI and its ability to pay its bills, recent reports of SoftBank talks to invest up to $30 billion more in OpenAI should ease some fears. Why we own it Microsoft is a core backbone of global productivity thanks to its Office 365 suite and hybrid cloud platform Azure. The company is also proving itself to be a key player in artificial intelligence tools. Competitors : Amazon , Alphabet , and Salesforce Weight in portfolio : 2.87% Most recent buy : Aug. 5, 2024 Initiated : Dec. 4, 2017 In short, it was a solid quarter but not enough upside to change the tide against the stock. We\\'ve seen AI companies fall out of favor, only to recapture the market\\'s interest a couple of quarters later. This happened to Alphabet last year. And, the post-earnings move in Meta Platforms shares Wednesday evening suggests it could be next. Microsoft has some issues to sort out to either get more Azure capacity online or to better balance capital expenditure growth to improve margins. The recent stock decline is disappointing, but we\\'re betting CEO Satya Nadella and CFO Amy Hood will figure it out. That\\'s why we\\'re reiterating our buy-equivalent 1 rating and $600-per-share price target. Quarterly commentary Productivity and Business Processes revenue increased about 16% year over year to $34.1 billion, beating estimates by about $640 million. Segment operating income increased 22% year over year to $20.6 billion, beating estimates by about $1.35 billion. Microsoft 365 commercial cloud revenue increased 17% year over year (up 14% on a constant currency basis, which excludes foreign exchange fluctuations). The higher revenue was driven by an increase in revenue per user, thanks to the adoption of the Microsoft 365 E5 enterprise tier and Microsoft 365 Copilot products. Commercial seats also increased 6%. For all the criticism that Copilot gets, seat growth accelerated quarter over quarter to 15 million paid seats. Microsoft 365 consumer cloud revenue growth increased 29% year over year (up 27% in constant currency). LinkedIn revenue was up 11% year over year (up 10% constant currency), and revenue from the Dynamics 365 customer relations and operations suite increased 19% year over year (up 17% constant currency). Intelligent cloud revenue increased roughly 28% year over year, beating estimates by about $500 million. Segment operating income of $13.87 billion exceeded the consensus estimate by about $200 million as margins shrank due to increased AI investments. Revenue growth from Azure and other cloud services ticked down from the prior quarter to 39% year over year, (38% on a constant currency basis). That\\'s about in line with the consensus estimate of 38.4% on a reported basis and 37.8% in constant currency. We suspect the Azure growth numbers were a source of the after-hours disappointment as investors wanted to see a bigger beat to justify all that AI spending. The More Personal Computing segment was the only one that missed revenue expectations, dipping 3% year over year to $14.25 billion, due to lower gaming sales. However, Windows OEM and Devices revenue were stable, and Search and News advertising revenue increased. Despite the revenue shortfall, operating income was a little better than expected. Capital Expenditures , including assets acquired under finance leases, totaled $37.5 billion, up the aforementioned 66% year over year. It was also a $2.6 billion increase sequentially and roughly $850 million more than the consensus estimate. The company said that about two-thirds of this spend was for short-lived assets like GPUs (graphics processing units) and CPUs (central processing units) needed to support Azure\\'s demand, AI solutions, and research and development. Guidance The midpoint of the revenue outlook for Microsoft\\'s fiscal 2026 third quarter was roughly in line with the consensus estimate. In total, the company expects revenue of $80.65 billion to $81.75 billion, which at a midpoint of $81.20 billion edged the consensus of $81.18 billion. By segment, the company guided Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud revenue above estimates, while More Personal Computing missed because of excess personal computer inventory. The key line within Intelligent Cloud was Azure, and CFO Amy Hood guided revenue growth on a constant currency basis to 37% to 38%. That\\'s about in-line with the Street estimate of 37% but represents another down tick from 38% in the reported quarter. At least capex isn\\'t expected to be as high next quarter. Those investments are expected to decrease on a sequential basis \"due to the normal variability from cloud infrastructure build-outs and the timing of delivery of finance leases.\" (Jim Cramer\\'s Charitable Trust is long MSFT, GOOGL, META.

The light is then guided using ultra-precise mirrors and reflected off a mask containing the pattern for one layer of the chip, which is then shrunk and projected onto a silicon wafer.\\n\\nThose systems are bought by chip foundries like Taiwanese company TSMC, which are contracted by chip designers like Nvidia.\\n\\nCorreonero said companies like Japan\\'s Nikon and Canon, which ship some lithography machines for non-advanced process nodes, were \"far-away competitors.\"\\n\\n\"They are large conglomerates which have invested only a tiny fraction of what ASML has invested over three decades. At this point, catching up is virtually impossible,\" he added.\\n\\n## Looking ahead\\n\\nEUVs make up the majority of ASML\\'s booking value, contributing 7.4 billion euros ($8.8 billion) to a total 13.2 billion euros in net bookings in the fourth quarter of 2025. Across 2025, the company sold 48 EUV systems, generating 11.6 billion euros in revenue.\\n\\nWhile ASML doesn\\'t publicly reveal what its machines cost, analysts told CNBC that the price tag for its most advanced high NA EUV is between 320 million and 400 million euros. Its low NA EUV sells for around 220 million euros, said Correonero.\\n\\nCompanies like TSMC, Intel and Samsung are experimenting with the high NA EUV in a lab setting at the moment, he added.\\n\\n\"Once customers are accustomed to the tool, it is gradually introduced into high volume manufacturing. High NA is expected to reach high volume manufacturing by 2027-2028, with Intel as the first adopter,\" Correonero said.\\n\\nASML\\'s share price rose 36% last year. It\\'s surged another 32% since Jan. 1. Earlier this month, it became just the third European company to see its valuation hit the half-trillion dollar mark, gains which it has held.\\n\\nAnalysts expect the stock to keep rising, as advanced chips remain critical to the continuing AI buildout. ASML predicts that 2026 will see net sales hit between 34 billion and 39 billion euros, ahead of the 32.7 billion euros it picked up in 2025.'},\n",

While one isn't necessarily better than the other, they serve different purposes.\\n\\nCash back credit cards are often ideal for simplicity and ease of use. The cash back you earn doesn't change in value, and you can often apply it as a statement credit to offset your credit card balance. A common cash back percentage to look for is at least 1.5% to 2% cash back on all purchases, with some cards offering higher rates in certain categories. One downside to cash back is that it's not very flexible; it's typically tied to straightforward redemption options, like gift cards or a direct deposit.\\n\\nAlternatively, credit card points earn an issuer-specific point currency, which can be redeemed for a number of options — from merchandise to, most prominently, travel. The value of points can vary depending on how you redeem them, but a single point is generally worth between 0.5 cents and 2 cents or more. Using points for more complex redemptions (such as transfer partner travel) can often get you tremendous value, while redeeming for merchandise or gift cards may net lower value.\\n\\n## Does picking your rewards earn you more points?\\n\\nCustomizing your credit card rewards can earn you more points in many cases. While your maximum earning potential may be lower depending on the card, your overall earnings can be more consistent; you're less likely to waste bonus categories on spending you don't actually do.\\n\\nFor example, instead of using a card that earns 5% cash back on bonus categories that rotate each quarter, a customizable rewards card ensures you're earning elevated rewards on categories you actually spend in year-round. Alternatively, if your highest spending categories vary from month to month, a customizable rewards card gives you the power to adjust your bonus categories as needed.\\n\\nAll in all, it really comes down to your spending choices, so look for a card with categories that reward you for your habitual purchases.\\n\\n**Subscribe to the CNBC Select Newsletter!**\\n\\nMoney matters — so make the most of it.

The extent of ICE\\'s noncompliance is almost certainly substantially understated,\" the judge said.\\n\\n\"This list is confined to orders issued since January 1, 2026, and the list was hurriedly compiled by extraordinarily busy judges. Undoubtedly, mistakes were made, and orders that should have appeared on this list were omitted.\"\\n\\nWhen contacted by CNBC, Ojala-Barbour said, \"We stipulated with the government that Mr Tobay Robles has been released from custody,\" but gave no further comment.\\n\\nICE and the U.S. Attorney\\'s Office for the District of Minnesota did not immediately respond to requests for comment from CNBC sent by email.\\n\\nSchiltz, in his order Monday demanding Lyons\\' appearance in court, called the order \"an extraordinary step.\"\\n\\nBut the judge also said, \"This Court has been extremely patient with respondents, even though respondents decided to send thousands of agents to Minnesota to detain aliens without making any provision for dealing with the hundreds of habeas petitions and other lawsuits that were sure to result.\"\\n\\nMinneapolis has been flooded with ICE and other federal agents as the Trump administration seeks to round up undocumented immigrants there and elsewhere in the state.\\n\\nTwo U.S. citizens, Renee Good and Alex Pretti, have been fatally shot this month by federal agents during separate confrontations.

       "  'content': 'The Federal Reserve on Wednesday voted to take a break from a recent run of interest rate cuts, as the central bank navigates questions about its independence and awaits a new leader.\\n\\nMeeting market expectations, the central bank\\'s Federal Open Market Committee voted to keep its key interest rate in a range between 3.5%-3.75%. The decision put a halt to three consecutive quarter percentage point reductions, billed as maintenance moves to guard against potential downturns in the labor market.\\n\\nIn voting to hold the line, the committee raised its assessment of economic growth. It also eased its concerns about the labor market as compared with inflation.\\n\\n\"Available indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace. Job gains have remained low, and the unemployment rate has shown some signs of stabilization,\" the post-meeting statement said. \"Inflation remains somewhat elevated.\"\\n\\nImportantly, the statement also erased a clause indicating that the committee saw a higher risk from the threat of a weakening labor market than that of heightened inflation. That would argue for a pause on rate cuts at least in the near term as officials see the Fed\\'s dual goals of low inflation and full employment more in balance.\\n\\nThere was little in the way of guidance about what\\'s coming next, with markets expecting the Fed to wait until at least June before adjusting its benchmark rate again.\\n\\n\"In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks,\" the statement said, repeating language inserted in December that markets saw as a shift away from the easing cycle that began in September 2025.\\n\\nTreasury yields moved higher following the decision, while the S&P 500 hovered just 7,000.\\n\\n## Miran, Waller dissent\\n\\nAs has been the case for recent meetings, there were dissents.\\n\\nGovernors Stephen Miran and Christopher Waller voted against the hold, with both advocating another quarter-point cut. This was Miran\\'s fourth consecutive dissent, however, he had previously advocated for a deeper half-point cut.\\n\\nBoth officials were appointed by President Donald Trump, with Miran filing an unexpired board seat in September 2025 and Waller appointed during Trump\\'s first term. Miran\\'s term expires Saturday, while Waller interviewed for the Fed chair\\'s job but is considered a long shot.\\n\\nThe other 10 FOMC members approved the hold, a group that included a new group of four regional presidents who joined the seven governors and New York Fed President John Williams as voters.\\n\\nThe routine nature of the decision comes at a time when nothing is routine for the central bank.\\n\\nChair Jerome Powell has just two more meetings before his term at the helm ends, ending a tumultuous eight years at the Fed that has included a global pandemic, a steep recession and a seemingly endless series of battles against Trump.\\n\\n\"If you look at the incoming data since the last meeting, [there is] clear improvement in the outlook for growth,\" Powell said during a news conference. \"Inflation performed about as expected, and ... some of the labor market data came in suggesting evidence of stabilization. So it\\'s overall, a stronger forecast, really.\"\\n\\nMost recently, the Justice Department has subpoenaed Powell over the extensive renovations at the Fed\\'s headquarters in Washington, D.C. Before that, the president threatened on multiple occasions to fire Powell and in fact has moved to sack Governor Lisa Cook, a case that is now pending a decision from the U.S. Supreme Court.\\n\\nWhen asked about his decision to attend oral arguments at the high court, Powell said the case is \"perhaps the most important\" in the Fed\\'s 113-year history.\\n\\nUnderscoring all of the tension has been a battle over the Fed\\'s independence, or its ability to operate without political interference. In confirming the Justice Department probe, an unusually candid Powell attributed the threat to Trump\\'s efforts to control monetary policy. Prior presidents also have criticized Fed decisions and tried to coerce policymakers into rate cuts, but none have been as aggressive or public about it as Trump.\\n\\nThe Fed also has a challenging economic backdrop to navigate.\\n\\nGrowth as measured by the widest measure, gross domestic product, has been robust. The third quarter motored ahead at a 4.4% clip and the final three months of the year are tracking at a 5.4% rate, according to the Atlanta Fed.\\n\\nAt the same time, hiring is slow in the labor market amid a Trump administration crackdown on illegal immigration. However, layoffs also have been tame, with the trend for initial jobless claims running at its lowest level in two years.\\n\\nInflation, though, has proven more troublesome. While off its 40-year highs back in 2022, the rate is still running closer to 3% than the Fed\\'s 2% goal, causing concern among some FOMC officials who either want rate cuts paused or eliminated until there\\'s more evidence that price increases are easing.\\n\\nTrump\\'s tariffs are running in the background when it comes to inflation, with Fed economists generally seeing the duties as adding near-term pressures that will abate later this year.\\n\\nFutures markets are pricing in at most two rate reductions in 2026 and none in 2027, regardless of the next Fed chair. Predictions markets are pointing to BlackRock bond chief Rick Rieder as the likely candidate to succeed Powell.'},\n",

If the chamber doesn\\'t pass all of them, much of the federal government would shut down Saturday at 12:01 ET.\\n\\nThe bills would fund the Department of Homeland Security and several other agencies, including the Treasury and Defense departments. While the package once looked certain to clear the Senate and avoid a shutdown, the killing of U.S. citizen Alex Pretti by federal immigration agents Saturday in Minneapolis derailed it.\\n\\nDemocrats are demanding that the DHS portion of the bill be stripped from the package and weighed separately to make changes to how the agency operates, a move that Republicans have so far resisted. On Wednesday, some Senate Republicans began to embrace the idea of splitting off DHS, as a shutdown looms just months after a record 43-day closure last year.\\n\\nThe measure will require 60 votes to clear the Senate filibuster. Republicans hold only 53 seats in the upper chamber, meaning Democrats can block it if they withhold their votes.\\n\\n\"Rather than scuttling the whole package, I say let\\'s go and pass what we can,\" Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., said in an interview with reporters at the Capitol on Wednesday.\\n\\n\"I think all the bills will pass except Homeland Security, and then we can sit down and talk about Homeland Security,\" said Kennedy, who sits on the Senate Appropriations Committee.\\n\\nAsked how many of his Republican colleagues support such a move, Kennedy said: \"A bunch.\"\\n\\nIndeed, numerous Republicans said Wednesday that while they would like to see the entire package pass the Senate, splitting off DHS is a palatable off-ramp.\\n\\n\"We are going to see what happens when that vote comes up,\" said Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., another member of the appropriations committee. \"[But] if the Democrats block it, [Senate Minority Leader Chuck] Schumer has already said that he\\'s willing to move the five, and so I certainly have an open mind on that.\"\\n\\nSen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., told CNBC that if Democrats are \"okay with five of the six bills,\" then \"we ought to figure out a way to get those done.\"\\n\\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said in a press conference Wednesday that such proposals are so far \"hypotheticals\" and that he would \"reserve optionality.\"\\n\\n\"I think the best path forward, as I\\'ve said, is to keep the package intact,\" Thune said. \"If there are things that the Democrats want that the administration can agree with them about, then let\\'s do that.\"\\n\\nDemocrats are warning that a separate negotiation with the administration would not be enough to assuage their concerns. President Donald Trump has attempted a turnabout in recent days after the fallout from the shooting of Pretti in Minnesota, recently saying he will deescalate his immigration crackdown in the state.\\n\\n\"This has to be in the bill,\" said Sen. Angus King of Maine, an independent who caucuses with Democrats. \"I don\\'t think we could settle for promises.\" King repeatedly voted to reopen the government during the last shutdown, bucking his caucus.\\n\\n\"I can\\'t in good conscience vote for a DHS budget under these circumstances,\" King said, calling for the DHS component to be separated so the rest of the bills can pass. DHS is conducting immigration operations in Maine.\\n\\nSchumer, D-N.Y., listed Democrats\\' demands in a press conference Wednesday.\\n\\nHe said Democrats want a DHS funding package to include new guardrails for federal immigration enforcement. Those guardrails include a requirement for warrants for arrests, a ban on federal agents wearing masks, mandatory body cameras and a uniform code of conduct for federal agents.\\n\\n\"Democrats stand ready today to pass the five bipartisan bills in the Senate, but the DHS bill needs serious work,\" Schumer said. \"It\\'s now on Leader Thune to separate out the DHS bill ... and start working with Democrats to rein in ICE.\"\\n\\nRepublicans appear to be plowing ahead with plans to vote on all six bills.\\n\\n\"We\\'re voting on this tomorrow,\" said Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla. \"Anything can change in 24 hours, but our plan is to vote on six bills.\"\\n\\nShould that vote fail and Senate Republicans decide to split off the DHS portion, it would likely require a unanimous consent request on the Senate floor to alter the bill, given the short timeline. Any one senator could object to such a move, drawing out the timeline and further risking a shutdown.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve got concerns with that, but I\\'d have to examine it,\" said Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, when asked by CNBC if he would object to stripping out the DHS bill from the package.\\n\\nRepublicans also note that a shutdown at DHS would also mean that the Federal Emergency Management Agency would go unfunded during a winter cold snap that has brought bitter temperatures, ice and snow to a large part of the country. King suggested that a short-term continuing resolution could keep FEMA and other agencies afloat.\\n\\nAny changes the Senate makes to the package would also require reapproval by the House. The House is out of Washington on recess, with plans to return next week — after the shutdown deadline.\\n\\n\"If the bill changes much from what the House already passed, then you\\'ve got another steep hill to climb over there,\" Thune said.\\n\\nDHS would largely also be able to keep operating its immigration enforcement apparatus even if it enters into a shutdown. Republicans gave the agency hundreds of billions of dollars in supplemental appropriations as part of the tax and spending package passed last year.\\n\\n**Correction: This story has been updated to reflect the correct day of the shutdown**'},\n",

       "  'title': 'Can Venezuela get back to producing 3 million barrels of crude oil a day?',\n",
       "  'summary': 'A revitalized Venezuelan oil industry could lift production from 800,000 barrels daily back to its peak of 3 million, but the path will be long and costly.',\n",
       "  'published': 'Wed, 28 Jan 2026 20:13:03 GMT',\n",
       "  'content': 'There is a long road ahead to restoring Venezuela\\'s crude oil production to its former levels.\\n\\nFollowing the capture of Venezuela President Nicolás Maduro and his indictment in the U.S., attention has shifted to the potential for a U.S.-led effort to bring oil majors back to a politically unstable country, which nationalized many of their assets in 2007, and revive crude output that has fallen significantly in recent decades.\\n\\nVenezuela currently produces an average of 800,000 barrels of crude oil per day, well below its peak of 3.5 million barrels per day, or bpd, in the 1990s. Oil production declined sharply following the 2007 expropriation of U.S. oil major assets. Production fell further during the global oil crash of 2014-2016, when crude prices fell by as much as 70%. Even as oil prices stabilized in the latter half of that decade, Venezuelan production did not recover, and its production took a further hit from the pandemic-triggered oil price decline in 2020.\\n\\nIn the past few years, Venezuela\\'s oil production has recovered slightly, but more important to the global market is its oil reserves. According to research firm Wood Mackenzie, Venezuela has at least 241 billion barrels of recoverable crude oil. Analysts at Bernstein say that figure may be as high as 300 billion barrels of proven reserves, among the largest in the world. \"Venezuela has the potential to be an oil superpower,\" according to a recent note from Bernstein.\\n\\nBut Wall Street remains skeptical that those reserves can be turned into production upside anytime soon.\\n\\nBernstein noted in its research that the subsurface reserves are not the issue, and never have been. It is the \"above-surface constraints\" that pose the biggest issues for Venezuela. \"Since the 2006/07 nationalization of western oil company interests by Hugo Chavez, lack of investment, mismanagement, neglect, have driven an oil production decline of 70% to just 1% of current global output,\" it noted.\\n\\nU.S. oil majors are also skeptical, for good reason. With oil trading around the $60 level — though a new geopolitical spark sent the price higher on Wednesday after President Donald Trump warned Iran that a \"massive Armada\" was heading in its direction and that time is running out to make a deal on its nuclear program — Western oil companies remain focused on capital discipline and efficient use of cash flow after being burned during the oil price crash of the last decade and punished by investors for overproduction and high exploration budgets. Add to that the specific risk of being \"twice bitten by Venezuelan nationalization,\" according to Bernstein, and it is a reason to remain \"exceptionally cautious about committing fresh capital quickly.\"\\n\\nAt a recent White House meeting with oil company CEOs, after Trump said U.S. oil companies would spend $100 billion on Venezuelan oil production, Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods voiced what was the underlying concern of many of his energy sector peers, telling Trump that the Venezuelan market is \"uninvestable\" in its current state.\\n\\nChevron, the only big U.S. oil company currently operating in Venezuela, holds a major advantage. The oil major has been operating in the country since 1923 and never left after the nationalization, with a joint venture with national oil company PDVSA currently at about 240,000 barrels per day. Chevron Vice Chairman Mark Nelson said at the White House meeting it could increase Venezuelan oil production \"within our own disciplined investment schemes by about 50% just in the next 18 to 24 months.\"\\n\\nU.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright recently said the U.S. has received 30% higher prices for Venezuelan crude in its first sales since the military action. Trump has said Venezuela will turn over 30 million to 50 million barrels of sanctioned oil to the U.S., to be sold at market prices.\\n\\nWolfe Research believes production could increase to around 1 million bpd over the next few years with maintenance. \"For now, we see the impact as less about oil prices than the potential for U.S. companies to recover legacy interests,\" it wrote in a recent note.\\n\\nHowever, the Trump administration has said new production, rather than reclaiming nationalized assets, is the top priority. Chinese and Russian state-controlled oil companies also hold the rights to millions of barrels in Venezuela, up to 6.5 million barrels, according to Wood Mackenzie and Morgan Stanley research.\\n\\nThe U.S. refining system, on the other hand, is particularly well placed to process Venezuela\\'s crude now. \"In the absence of sanctions or other disruptions, U.S. Gulf Coast refiners are the natural destination of Venezuela\\'s crude,\" Bernstein wrote. That bet has already paid off for some investors and refining stocks including Valero Energy. The first purchases of Venezuelan oil by U.S. refiners were made in recent days, including by Valero.\\n\\nRecent Venezuelan oil production and exports fell to as low as 0.5 million bpd after the U.S. heightened pressure on the country under the weight of sanctions. BMO Capital Markets noted in a recent research report that it does not expect any meaningful near-term changes, but it does see potential over the longer term.\\n\\n\"We expect little change in oil export levels in the near term and concomitantly little impact on crude oil prices; however, if there is a larger change in control that allows a return of the U.S. majors (and potentially others) this could lead to higher production levels in 3-5 years,\" BMO Capital Markets analysts wrote in their recent note.\\n\\nJPMorgan Chase estimates that with political stability, unrestricted operations and new licensing deals, Venezuela could raise production quickly to as high as 1.2 million bpd within months, representing an increase of roughly 250,000 bpd compared to its 2025 average. Its team estimates that production could hit 1.4 million bpd in two years, and over the next decade, output could eventually reach 2.5 million bpd.\\n\\nGoldman Sachs co-head of commodities research Daan Struyven said on a recent podcast that production could rise by about 50% by 2030, and potentially double if there is substantial investment from U.S. oil producers.\\n\\nOther analysts note that rebuilding production will ultimately depend on large-scale investment. David Oxley, Capital Economics chief climate and commodities economist, said he estimates it would require around $15 billion to $20 billion in investment over the next decade in order to raise Venezuela\\'s oil output to 1.5 million bpd.\\n\\nFor now, Morgan Stanley sees the risks to production remaining \"clearly to the upside\" and cited similar scale of investment as a major factor. While an analysis from Wood Mackenzie that Morgan Stanley cited suggests that Venezuelan well workovers can boost production significantly, back to the range of 2 million bpd (the mid-2010s level) within a two-year period, it also predicts that the Venezuelan crude market will struggle beyond that level. \"Going beyond that would require significant investments. Wood Mac estimates that it would take $15-20bn of investment over 10 year to add the next 0.5 mb/d,\" Morgan Stanley wrote in a recent note to clients, and it added that this outlook is contingent on government stability, sanctions policy and fiscal terms, \"not just oil in the ground.\"\\n\\n\"Getting oil production back up to 3+ million barrels in Venezuela would require a vast amount of investment — probably in the region of $180 billion over the next 15 years or so,\" Oxley wrote in an email to CNBC.\\n\\n*Correction: Chevron Vice Chairman Mark Nelson said at a White House meeting it could increase Venezuelan oil production \"within our own disciplined investment schemes by about 50% just in the next 18 to 24 months.\" An earlier version of this article misattributed the Chevron statement. *'}]"

       "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg plans to ramp up his company's spending on artificial intelligence in 2026. Wall Street seems fine with that strategy.\n",
       "\n",
       "In its fourth-quarter earnings report on Wednesday, Meta beat on the top and bottom lines while also revealing that its AI-related capital expenditures this year will be between $115 billion and $135 billion. That's nearly twice the amount Meta spent on capex last year, when the company revamped its AI unit.\n",
       "\n",
       "Although investors have previously expressed concern about Meta's AI spending spree, they took comfort in the company's latest results, which showed 24% year-over-year revenue growth, driven by online ads. Meta shares, which trailed the market last year, popped as much as 10% in after-hours trading.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"As we plan for the future, we will continue to invest very significantly in infrastructure to train leading models and deliver personal super intelligence to billions of people and businesses around the world,\" Zuckerberg told analysts during the earnings call.\n",
       "\n",
       "Zuckerberg was referring to Meta's ambitious data center buildouts intended to anchor both current and future AI projects.\n",
       "\n",
       "Meta finance chief Susan Li told analysts that the company continues to be \"capacity constrained,\" meaning it needs more computing power to further improve its core ad business while also providing its AI team the necessary resources to create more advanced models and products.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Our teams have done a great job ramping up our infrastructure through the course of 2025, but demands for compute resources across the company have increased even faster than our supply,\" Li said.\n",
       "\n",
       "Zuckerberg said 2026 will be a major year for AI, with Meta's investments geared towards supporting his mission for \"building personal super intelligence.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Whether Meta will have much by way of new AI products that can generate revenue remains a major question, and one Zuckerberg hasn't clearly answered.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I mean, we're going to roll out new products over the course of the year,\" Zuckerberg said on the call. \"I think the important thing is, we're not just launching one thing, and we're building a lot of things.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Perhaps Zuckerberg's biggest swing last year was the $14.3 billion investment in Scale AI, which brought founder and CEO Alexandr Wang and some of his top engineers and researchers to Meta. Wang is now leading Meta's TBD AI unit, which has been testing a new frontier model code-named Avocado that's intended to be a successor to the company's Llama family of models, CNBC reported.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I expect our first models will be good but, more importantly, will show the rapid trajectory that we're on,\" Zuckerberg said Wednesday. \"And then I expect us to steadily push the frontier over the course of the year as we continue to release new models.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Asked on the call why Meta needs to develop its own powerhouse AI foundation model, Zuckerberg said it's important because Meta is a \"deep technology company.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Meta can't risk being \"constrained to what others in the ecosystem are building or allow us to build,\" he said, adding that controlling a model allows you to help \"shape the future of these products.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "In the meantime, online advertising still accounts for the overwhelming majority of Meta's revenue. As long as that business continues to dominate in mobile, exceed expectations and throw off billions of dollars of cash a quarter, Zuckerberg is likely to get plenty of leeway to pursue his AI ambitions.\n",
