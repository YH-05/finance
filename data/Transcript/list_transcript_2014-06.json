      "transcript_text1": "Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining this call. Earlier this afternoon, we announced revisions to our second quarter and full year outlooks. In addition, we also provided details about our Fresh Start initiative, which involved a redesign of DuPont's global business support functions. We are conducting this call to share insights on both subjects. We will provide more details about our second quarter results in 4 weeks on our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings conference call, July 22. \r\nWith me are Ellen Kullman, Chair and Chief Executive Officer; Nick Fanandakis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jim Borel, Executive Vice President, responsible for our Agriculture and Nutrition & Health segments. In today's call, Nick will review our outlook revisions. Then Jim will provide his perspectives on what we are seeing in Agriculture. Ellen will then follow by kicking off our Fresh Start initiative.\r\nDuring the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements. All statements that address expectations or projections about the future are forward-looking statements. Although they reflect our current expectations, these statements are not guarantees of future performance, but involve a number of risks and assumptions. We urge you to review DuPont's SEC filings for a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. We will also refer to non-GAAP measures, and we request that you review the reconciliations to GAAP statements provided with our news release.\r\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Nick. Nick?\n\n---\n\nThank you, Carl. As Carl mentioned, we issued a news release revising our second quarter and full year operating earnings per share outlooks. Based on actual results for the quarter through May and our estimates of June sales, we anticipate second quarter operating earnings per share will be down moderately versus the $1.28 we earned last year. Our previous expectation of segment results provided to you in April indicated that our operating earnings would be up for the quarter. As a result, we are adjusting our operating earnings per share outlook for the full year to a range of $4 to $4.10 per share to reflect the reduction in our second quarter outlook. \r\nThe operating earnings outlook for the majority of our segments remains unchanged from our previous guidance in April. Our Nutrition & Health, Industrial Biosciences, Safety & Protection and Electronics & Communications results are all on plan, with most of these segments expected to post substantial gains in operating earnings. Gradual improvement in demand for our products, coupled with our productivity initiatives, are delivering improved results in our industrial-facing segments. \r\nOur revised second quarter and full year outlooks, however, are driven primarily by lower expectations for second quarter operating earnings from our Agriculture segment and, due to a lesser degree, from Performance Chemicals. \r\nPerformance Chemicals operating earnings are below our April forecast due primarily to lower-than-expected selling prices in refrigerants for mobile and stationary applications. Prices for R-22 have not recovered from the prior year following the increase in production allocations granted by the EPA. And HFC prices, principally 134a, remain under pressure due to heavy imports. \r\nI'm going to now ask Jim to provide comments about our revised outlook in Agriculture, after which, Ellen will address our announcement about our Fresh Start initiative. Jim?\n\n---\n\nAs Nick mentioned, the primary driver of our lower guidance is in the Agriculture segment. As we've discussed previously, this is a year of transition in Agriculture as markets normalize following the droughts of 2011 and 2012, which led to unusually low global grain stocks, followed by historic peaks in commodity prices and planted acres.\r\nAs the year has progressed, global corn planted area continues to be negatively influenced by economics, which favor planting soybeans over corn. In addition, weather has also been a factor impacting local grower decisions with respect to crop choice and herbicide application and, to a lesser extent, weaker global currencies have also challenged the Agriculture business. We now expect second quarter operating earnings in the Agriculture segment to be down low-teens percent, as compared to 2013. The largest driver of the decline versus our April outlook is in corn seed, where volume will not meet our previous expectations. We also expect North America corn pricing to be a bit lower than our previous expectations but still slightly higher than last season on solid demand for our newest technologies, like AQUAmax and AcreMax. \r\nGiven the favorable soybean economics, our soybean sales volumes in North America are higher than we expected in April. However, these gains won't fully offset the decline in corn volume on an acre or an earnings basis, as we are in transition with our soybean lineup. \r\nLooking to the future, we're pleased with what we see coming in our soybean product line as our breeding engine is focused on delivering new products as demonstrated by the initial success of new-generation T Series varieties and we continue to ramp up volumes of Roundup Ready 2. Because of the lower-than-expected sales volume, we will have higher-than-expected levels of ending surplus seed inventory in North America and in Europe. As a result, we expect to record an additional inventory write-down charge and incur some additional warehousing costs in the second quarter. \r\nIn Brazil, we experienced higher-than-expected corn seed returns as growers there planted fewer hybrid corn hectares in the safrinha season. We're also anticipating lower corn hectares for the upcoming summer season in Latin America. \r\nIn Crop Protection, second quarter volumes in North America will be lower than expected, particularly in herbicide sales and, to a lesser extent, some of our fungicide products. These lower volumes are impacted by a wet spring, a delayed and compressed application season, and distributor de-stocking of elevated inventory levels. Our Crop Protection markets outside North America in the second quarter is playing out largely along our expectations. Despite these challenges of the second quarter, we expect to deliver another year of solid growth in DuPont Crop Protection. \r\nFor the full year, we now expect Agriculture segment operating earnings to be modestly below last year, primarily due to the lower seed volumes I discussed. While Agriculture results this year will be below our expectations, I'm confident in our strategy in Agriculture. Despite the normal year-to-year ebbs and flows in grain stocks, planted area and local product performance, our ability to continue to innovate will be the force that drives our growth. Ellen?\n\n---\n\nLet me be clear that our revision to the outlook we made today do not meet my expectations for our Ag business or the company. Market dynamics, weather and shift to soybeans are certainly part of the reason for our revisions. We're applying our learnings and adjusting our plans so that we get back on our 5-year track record of delivering reliable, attractive growth from this business. \r\nLooking beyond this year's outlook, our Ag segment is a market leader executing a winning strategy. Our pipeline in Agriculture is as strong as I've seen it, and we have the leading route-to-market in seed. I'm excited about the new genetics, trait options and services offerings in seed and the new novel active ingredients in Crop Protection. Optimum Leptra, Lumigen seed treatments, corn event DP 4114 [ph], and T Series Soybeans are a few examples of the exciting innovative products we expect to deliver to farmers over the next few years. This gives me confidence in our future growth in Agriculture and its continued ability to be a key growth driver for DuPont. \r\nAnd our Ag segment is an important part of a bigger story about a new DuPont taking shape, a DuPont that is reconfiguring itself for higher growth and higher value. I'd like to shift focus now and introduce you to what we call our Fresh Start initiative. Over the past 6 months, I've shared with you our intent to streamline the way we support our businesses globally, largely, as a result of our decision to separate the Performance Chemicals segment in mid-2015. So we are fundamentally rethinking our company's operational structure to drive down costs and firmly embed greater efficiencies. \r\nFollowing the Performance Chemicals separation, DuPont will be a different company in many ways. While our focus on leveraging our leading-science capabilities to solve some of the world's greatest problems remains unchanged, our manufacturing footprint and the resources and support required to sustain it will be different. Additionally, continued modernization and simplification of work will give us the opportunity for greater operational leverage and higher returns on capital through streamlining and integration. We call this effort our Fresh Start initiative. In total, we aim to achieve at least $1 billion in annual run rate cost reductions, of which 2/3 will be achieved on a run rate basis by the end of 2015, with the remainder by 2019, all from a 2013 baseline. \r\nThe first part of our Fresh Start initiative will eliminate any \tstranded costs associated with the separation of our Performance Chemicals segment. It goes far beyond that, though. We have taken a project-by-project approach that includes all of our businesses, functions and regions. Successfully executing these projects will align DuPont's cost structure with the 20% lower revenue base we're anticipating after separation. We will be nearly complete with this part of Fresh Start by the time separation occurs, not after separation, as was the case with our 2013 Performance Coatings divestiture. \r\nThe second part of Fresh Start is focused on providing our Performance Chemicals segment with the necessary capability to function as a separate company. Our work on this part will be complete by mid-2015, when we expect that DuPont will realize additional functional reductions of approximately $375 million as the Performance Chemicals separation is complete. \r\nOur third part is more extensive. We are redesigning our infrastructure by simplifying and standardizing data and streamlining the organization. Our focus is on automation and global standardization of transactional processes for a step-change improvement in operational planning and execution. This will greatly improve service to customers. In addition, we will see significantly better asset utilization and improved purchase of direct and indirect materials and logistics. It's a tall order, but it's absolutely necessary at this stage in the game for DuPont. We expect to be completed by the end of 2019, and we expect to achieve a minimum run rate savings of approximately $325 million per year. \r\nWe also believe that as we implement these changes, we will identify additional savings opportunities. It will make us a faster, leaner, more efficient and more streamlined company. And for a science-based, innovation-focused enterprise like ours, that's where we have to be. \r\nWhen you add it all up, all the parts of this initiative, we can reduce DuPont's costs by roughly $1 billion by the end of 2019 from a 2013 baseline. By the end of 2015, next year, we expect to be at a cost reduction run rate of $675 million. \r\nIn the second quarter of 2014, we will take a pretax charge of approximately $270 million related to the first action under the Fresh Start initiative. We anticipate that we will incur future charges related to Fresh Start as we implement additional actions under this initiative. \r\nWe think Fresh Start is a meaningful, positive step in the direction of building a stronger and more successful DuPont for the future. \r\nAnd with that, Carl, I'll turn it back to you.\n\n---\n\nOkay, thank you, Ellen. We're now able to open up the lines for your questions.",

We're now able to open up the lines for your questions.",
      "transcript_text3": "This is actually Ram Sivalingam sitting in for David. The first question is for Jim Borel. Thanks for the color on the source of the shortfall in the quarter. Is there any way to parse out and quantify the dollar impact lower planted acres had, adverse weather had and adverse effects had on you guys?\n\n---\n\nIt's difficult to separate it quite like that, but 2 things are important. One, certainly the acre decline on a season basis has had a big impact. If we look at just the change in the announcement today, it's difficult to tell until we know exactly what acres were planted, and so it was a very dynamic season, and we'll see when the dust settles on actual planted acres how much an impact that had on this particular change.\n\n---\n\nJim, can you shed some light on your corn inventory write-downs? Was it a result of a share loss? And then with the written-down seed, do you expect seed pricing to come under pressure for the next season?\n\n---\n\nThanks, P.J. So first of all, the -- as we went into the season or as the planting -- and May is a big month in Ag, as you know. And when the planting finished, we didn't get as much seed in the ground as we expected when that planting started. And that resulted in additional returns or excess seeds, which then led to the write-off. So it -- those are all tied together. In terms of impact on pricing and things next year, way too early to be able to speculate about that. But really -- but pricing has a lot more to do with the value delivered to the new lineup as it comes out, et cetera.\n\n---\n\nYes, Jim, just wondering on the full year decline in earnings, is it evenly split between Crop Protection and seed or greater in seed? And last year, for the first time, you actually were profitable in the second half in the overall Ag business. Do you still think you can hit that mark this year?\n\n---\n\nFirst of all, the change is largely seed, okay? So that's the first thing. And maybe a way to think about is probably about 2/3 seed-related corporately. And then the second -- the last 1/3 corporately is kind of evenly split between Crop Protection and DC&F, okay? So that gives you a little bit of the sizing. And I'm sorry, what was the second part of your question? I guess we can't go back. I'm sorry, Don. I hope I answered the whole question.\n\n---\n\nYes, I think Don, I think the important thing to realize is that crops are going to have -- crops have this hesitation in the second quarter. But crops did have a solid year this year.\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nWe're expecting good growth out of Crop Protection this year. Now it might be a little below expectation, but it's going to be good growth versus '13.\n\n---\n\nSo in rough terms, to save $1 billion, does it cost $1 billion? And when you look at the cost savings, which of the segments does the cost savings largely reside in? And then if you looked at it geographically, how would the cost savings be allocated?\n\n---\n\nSo thanks, Jeff, for the question. You know that it's not going to cost us $1 billion to save $1 billion because part of this is the standing up of the Performance Chemicals segment. But part of this is employee separations, things like that, and there are some assets involved in that. A part of it is systems improvement that are going to basically allow us to get a lot more leverage off of the cost base we have. I mean, it's broad. We'll have more information out as the Q is filed in July. But it's going to span all businesses. It's in all regions and in the corporate center. So because the functions really -- really, the streamlining of the functions in the region, they hit the businesses as well. So we aren't redesigning the corporate center, everything in this business, because it's not about governance, it's not about risk management or leverage, where we can get much lower cost, and we do have a lot of leverage both from a Center of Excellence and from a transactional base. So you'll get more information as we file the Q on this part of the restructuring. And then we're going to keep you up-to-date on it over time as -- because I think the $1 billion is what we've defined now and I think there's going to be more to come.\n\n---\n\nWhen you talk about the transition into soybeans, I assume you mean not having enough Roundup Ready to yield in the soybeans this current season? Can you comment how much of your U.S. soybeans you think next season will have Roundup Ready to yield?\n\n---\n\nYes. So first of all, when we talk about the transition, 2 things. We're bringing in the T Series and, of course, we started this season to introduce Roundup Ready 2 into the lineup. And that transition of bringing -- of converting to Roundup Ready 2 will continue as we ramp it up over the next few years. I think it's too early really to look at performance. So yes, it's too early to tell for sure where we'll land, but we'll look at the performance and see how fast the ramp goes.\n\n---\n\nThis is actually Neal Sangani on for Bob. A similar question on the Ag side. At recent investor conferences, you said you might have gotten some benefit from product lift, AcreMax and a few others on the corn side. Is that still going to take place or is it going to sharply reverse?\n\n---\n\nJim?\n\n---\n\nNo, we're seeing great acceptance of both our AcreMax products and AQUAmax. They continue to grow this season. That's given us both an increase in volume but also a price opportunity with those products. We have AQUAmax on about 10 million acres this year, and AcreMax is about 2/3 of our volume. So they're both very important parts of the lineup.\n\n---\n\nA 2-part question for Jim. Jim, one of your major competitors referenced or alluded to corn seed pricing pressure in Brazil and tied it to some insect resistance challenges. So I was wondering if you could speak to what you're seeing in that market. And then secondly, on herbicides, to what do you attribute the variance versus prior expectations? What do you think is driving that dynamic?\n\n---\n\nOn the first part, we have started to see some resistance to our Herculex trait with fall armyworm, which is one of the insects down there. Farmers have a lot of insects that they're battling. And Herculex is continuing to perform very well on the rest of them, but we've seen some resistance to fall armyworm. And we have a product called Leptra that I think we've talked to you about before that's in the pipeline. We'll have a limited introduction next year. So we have a solution for this that's just around the corner and will start into the market quickly. On the second part of your question, on herbicides, really, weather was a driver. We had a delayed start to the season. There were a number of preemergence applications that were missed, and that kind of set the things in motion for what we saw in the second quarter.\n\n---\n\nTwo questions. One, of the hit, how much is just straight currency? And then two -- and this is in Ag -- and Jim, the dual herbicide resistance looks like it's going to be very successful with farmers. Both your competitors, Dow and Monsanto are out pretty very heavy this summer with education programs, trying to get farmers accustomed to their products. I haven't seen you out there doing the same thing. If you kind of had a choice between the 2, what are you thinking for next year and when are you going to be out in front of farmers with what you're going to do with your soybean lineup with the dual herbicide resistance?\n\n---\n\nSo Nick, why don't you answer the currency question first, and then, Jim, why don't you take on the product?\n\n---\n\nYes. So Duffy, when you think about the currency piece and you think about it versus our expectations in the quarter, there really isn't a significant amount of currency impact in the quarter. For the half year point, that's a different story. But in the quarter, there's not a significant amount versus what expectation was. And then Jim?\n\n---\n\nYes, thanks, Nick. Regarding the Enlist and Xtend traits, I think that we've got access to both of those. They've been in testing. We're continuing to look. Based on the research we'll -- based on how they each perform, we'll make our decision around what role they each play in the lineup going forward.\n\n---\n\nThis is actually Ernie Ortiz filling in for John. So to get to the annual guide, it seems like the second half will have to come in a little bit stronger than what we currently have modeled in. So are there any areas that you feel more confident will come in stronger than you expected 3 months ago for the second half?\n\n---\n\nI mean, I'll start, and then Nick, why don't you finish? So we will get a little bit of benefit from the Fresh Start work in the second half, so that will help. Then as Nick said, the industrial businesses continue to perform at expectation. Nick, why don't you give a little more detail there?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think you captured a couple of key points there. So the first piece is, there will be some benefit in the second half from Fresh Start. You're talking in the low cents per share. But it is going to have some benefit in that second half. When you look at the performance that we've had in the first half across the segments and what the expectation is for the second quarter now, as I mentioned, many of those segments are performing right on plan. So we're seeing some of the things play out from a macro perspective in a lot of the industrials along the lines that we had expected to occur. So we have confidence in that regard as we move into the second half of the year.\n\n---\n\nOperator, we have time for one more question.\n\n---\n\nThis is George D'Angelo on for Laurence. Can you guys give a little more detail on Performance Chemicals, particularly regionally, where you guys saw weakness?\n\n---\n\nSure. The weakness in Performance Chemicals versus expectation was in our fluorochemicals business. And it was in the United States relative to our R-22 product and pricing there. As the EPA late last year, as they expanded the opportunity for product in that marketplace, it brought a lot of product into the country and depressed price. And that had not worked through the system yet. So it was a U.S.-based disappointment or miss, and it's a situation with these regulated markets that we work on and watch very closely. And this time we just had a miss on that.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Thank you, operator, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. We look forward to speaking with you again in 4 weeks, on July 22nd, when we have our final results for the second quarter. Thank you.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Ramanan  Sivalingam (Analysts)】\nThis is actually Ram Sivalingam sitting in for David. The first question is for Jim Borel. Thanks for the color on the source of the shortfall in the quarter. Is there any way to parse out and quantify the dollar impact lower planted acres had, adverse weather had and adverse effects had on you guys?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Borel (Executives)】\nIt's difficult to separate it quite like that, but 2 things are important. One, certainly the acre decline on a season basis has had a big impact. If we look at just the change in the announcement today, it's difficult to tell until we know exactly what acres were planted, and so it was a very dynamic season, and we'll see when the dust settles on actual planted acres how much an impact that had on this particular change.\n\n---\n\n【質問: P.J. Juvekar (Analysts)】\nJim, can you shed some light on your corn inventory write-downs? Was it a result of a share loss? And then with the written-down seed, do you expect seed pricing to come under pressure for the next season?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Borel (Executives)】\nThanks, P.J. So first of all, the -- as we went into the season or as the planting -- and May is a big month in Ag, as you know. And when the planting finished, we didn't get as much seed in the ground as we expected when that planting started. And that resulted in additional returns or excess seeds, which then led to the write-off. So it -- those are all tied together. In terms of impact on pricing and things next year, way too early to be able to speculate about that. But really -- but pricing has a lot more to do with the value delivered to the new lineup as it comes out, et cetera.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Donald Carson (Analysts)】\nYes, Jim, just wondering on the full year decline in earnings, is it evenly split between Crop Protection and seed or greater in seed? And last year, for the first time, you actually were profitable in the second half in the overall Ag business. Do you still think you can hit that mark this year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Borel (Executives)】\nFirst of all, the change is largely seed, okay? So that's the first thing. And maybe a way to think about is probably about 2/3 seed-related corporately. And then the second -- the last 1/3 corporately is kind of evenly split between Crop Protection and DC&F, okay? So that gives you a little bit of the sizing. And I'm sorry, what was the second part of your question? I guess we can't go back. I'm sorry, Don. I hope I answered the whole question.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ellen Kullman (Executives)】\nYes, I think Don, I think the important thing to realize is that crops are going to have -- crops have this hesitation in the second quarter. But crops did have a solid year this year.\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Borel (Executives)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ellen Kullman (Executives)】\nWe're expecting good growth out of Crop Protection this year. Now it might be a little below expectation, but it's going to be good growth versus '13.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jeffrey Zekauskas (Analysts)】\nSo in rough terms, to save $1 billion, does it cost $1 billion? And when you look at the cost savings, which of the segments does the cost savings largely reside in? And then if you looked at it geographically, how would the cost savings be allocated?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ellen Kullman (Executives)】\nSo thanks, Jeff, for the question. You know that it's not going to cost us $1 billion to save $1 billion because part of this is the standing up of the Performance Chemicals segment. But part of this is employee separations, things like that, and there are some assets involved in that. A part of it is systems improvement that are going to basically allow us to get a lot more leverage off of the cost base we have. I mean, it's broad. We'll have more information out as the Q is filed in July. But it's going to span all businesses. It's in all regions and in the corporate center. So because the functions really -- really, the streamlining of the functions in the region, they hit the businesses as well. So we aren't redesigning the corporate center, everything in this business, because it's not about governance, it's not about risk management or leverage, where we can get much lower cost, and we do have a lot of leverage both from a Center of Excellence and from a transactional base. So you'll get more information as we file the Q on this part of the restructuring. And then we're going to keep you up-to-date on it over time as -- because I think the $1 billion is what we've defined now and I think there's going to be more to come.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Roberts (Analysts)】\nWhen you talk about the transition into soybeans, I assume you mean not having enough Roundup Ready to yield in the soybeans this current season? Can you comment how much of your U.S. soybeans you think next season will have Roundup Ready to yield?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Borel (Executives)】\nYes. So first of all, when we talk about the transition, 2 things. We're bringing in the T Series and, of course, we started this season to introduce Roundup Ready 2 into the lineup. And that transition of bringing -- of converting to Roundup Ready 2 will continue as we ramp it up over the next few years. I think it's too early really to look at performance. So yes, it's too early to tell for sure where we'll land, but we'll look at the performance and see how fast the ramp goes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Neal Sangani (Analysts)】\nThis is actually Neal Sangani on for Bob. A similar question on the Ag side. At recent investor conferences, you said you might have gotten some benefit from product lift, AcreMax and a few others on the corn side. Is that still going to take place or is it going to sharply reverse?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ellen Kullman (Executives)】\nJim?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Borel (Executives)】\nNo, we're seeing great acceptance of both our AcreMax products and AQUAmax. They continue to grow this season. That's given us both an increase in volume but also a price opportunity with those products. We have AQUAmax on about 10 million acres this year, and AcreMax is about 2/3 of our volume. So they're both very important parts of the lineup.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kevin McCarthy (Analysts)】\nA 2-part question for Jim. Jim, one of your major competitors referenced or alluded to corn seed pricing pressure in Brazil and tied it to some insect resistance challenges. So I was wondering if you could speak to what you're seeing in that market. And then secondly, on herbicides, to what do you attribute the variance versus prior expectations? What do you think is driving that dynamic?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Borel (Executives)】\nOn the first part, we have started to see some resistance to our Herculex trait with fall armyworm, which is one of the insects down there. Farmers have a lot of insects that they're battling. And Herculex is continuing to perform very well on the rest of them, but we've seen some resistance to fall armyworm. And we have a product called Leptra that I think we've talked to you about before that's in the pipeline. We'll have a limited introduction next year. So we have a solution for this that's just around the corner and will start into the market quickly. On the second part of your question, on herbicides, really, weather was a driver. We had a delayed start to the season. There were a number of preemergence applications that were missed, and that kind of set the things in motion for what we saw in the second quarter.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Duffy Fischer (Analysts)】\nTwo questions. One, of the hit, how much is just straight currency? And then two -- and this is in Ag -- and Jim, the dual herbicide resistance looks like it's going to be very successful with farmers. Both your competitors, Dow and Monsanto are out pretty very heavy this summer with education programs, trying to get farmers accustomed to their products. I haven't seen you out there doing the same thing. If you kind of had a choice between the 2, what are you thinking for next year and when are you going to be out in front of farmers with what you're going to do with your soybean lineup with the dual herbicide resistance?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ellen Kullman (Executives)】\nSo Nick, why don't you answer the currency question first, and then, Jim, why don't you take on the product?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nicholas Fanandakis (Executives)】\nYes. So Duffy, when you think about the currency piece and you think about it versus our expectations in the quarter, there really isn't a significant amount of currency impact in the quarter. For the half year point, that's a different story. But in the quarter, there's not a significant amount versus what expectation was. And then Jim?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Borel (Executives)】\nYes, thanks, Nick. Regarding the Enlist and Xtend traits, I think that we've got access to both of those. They've been in testing. We're continuing to look. Based on the research we'll -- based on how they each perform, we'll make our decision around what role they each play in the lineup going forward.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ernie Ortiz (Analysts)】\nThis is actually Ernie Ortiz filling in for John.

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you, Jana. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our fiscal 2014 results. Joining me on the call today are Bill Cobb, our President and CEO; and Greg Macfarlane, our CFO. Jason Houseworth, President, Global Digital and Product Management, will be available during the Q&A session.\r\nIn connection with this call, we have posted today's press release on the Investor Relations website at hrblock.com. Some of the figures that we'll discuss today are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We reconcile the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP figures and the schedules attached to our press release.\r\nBefore we begin our prepared remarks, I'd like to remind everyone that this call will include forward-looking statements as defined under the securities laws. Such statements are based on current information and management's expectations as of this date and are not guarantees of future performance.\r\nForward-looking statements involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. As a result, our actual outcomes and results could differ materially. You can learn more about these risks in our Form 10-K for fiscal 2013 and our other SEC filings. H&R Block undertakes no obligation to publicly update these risk factors or forward-looking statements.\r\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Bill.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Colby, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today we announced our financial results for fiscal year 2014. I'm very pleased with our results this year. We entered this season with a strong plan to achieve our Tax Plus objectives and we executed very well. In fiscal 2014, we enhanced our service levels, while improving return mix and increased attach rates on our best-in-class  Financial Services products.\r\nWe successfully launched the first year of our digital product redesign, enhancing the client experience. We continue to educate our clients on the upcoming changes resulting from health care reform and gain some key learnings from our health care initiatives that will serve us well going into 2015 and beyond. And most importantly, we served our clients better than ever.\r\nThe result of these efforts was that we grew revenue, expanded margins and improved our customer satisfaction, while also continuing to invest in our business. I'll provide a greater level of detail on our performance for the year, but before doing so, I'd like to provide some overall context on the tax season.\r\nAs many of you know, there was a lot of noise in the market this year due to the delayed opening of e-file, our decision to eliminate the free federal 1040EZ promotion and aggressive pricing actions from our digital competitors. Total IRS filings returned to historical norms and exceeded our expectations, with returns up 1.4% from last year. The assisted category as a whole was essentially flat, while total digital returns increased nearly 6%.\r\nThere are a few reasons for the difference in growth rates between the assisted and digital categories. First, we believe that our decision to discontinue the free 1040EZ promotion in virtually all markets contributed to the growth in digital returns this year, as low loyalty filers, motivated solely by price, moved to DIY methods where they could file for free. \r\nSecond, the digital category continues to benefit from the migration of pen and paper filers, though at a slower pace than in prior years. And third, based on our experience this year and consistent with industry results the past several years, we continue to believe there is an increased mix of digital returns filed with the Earned Income Credit, or EIC, due to the inconsistent fraud prevention standards in filing returns containing this credit.\r\nAs a reminder, the EIC is one of the largest government social programs in the country and the IRS estimated that approximately $13 billion to $15 billion of improper payments were made to the EIC in 2013. This is obviously a significant issue for the U.S. Treasury Department and for the country. In fact, under federal law, every government agency is required to disclose their highest risk financial transactions, and the EIC is the only risk noted on a consistent basis by the IRS. \r\nSeveral years ago, the IRS took actions to address this concern that were not comprehensive, creating standards only for returns prepared by a paid tax professional. Thus, current standards for filing a return with the EIC are different for assisted returns and DIY returns, which has resulted in a shift from assisted to DIY over the past 5 years. Importantly, the assisted category would've gained share during that time had there not been a shift in EIC filers.\r\nWe have taken an industry leadership position against tax fraud and continue to advocate for consistent standards in both assisted and DIY tax returns in all respects, and in particular, those that contain the EIC. Until such parity standards are in place, we believe the improper payment issue will persist and the industry will continue to see a shift in returns containing these credits from assisted to DIY.\r\nWith that overview in the industry, let's turn to our performance for the year. We executed very well against our multi-year Tax Plus strategy in 2014. You'll recall from our conference call in March and our Investor Day in December that we are squarely focused on this strategy, which is centered on delivering value for our clients and driving higher revenues and profits through a balance of improved return mix and increased product attachments. Put simply, we served our clients better than ever, and in the process drove profitable growth.\r\nIn retail, we discontinued our free 1040EZ promotion in virtually all our markets, which, as anticipated, contributed to a significant increase in revenues despite lower revenue counts -- lower return counts. We also made changes to our pricing this year to be more strategic in how and when we provide discounts and what we charge for filing extensions. Despite these price increases, retention of non-EZ filers was essentially flat for the year, continuing to outpace our branded retail competitors.\r\nAnother important element of our strategy was to improve how we serve our clients by making investments in our retail locations, technology and in our people. Specifically, we are nearing completion in our initiatives to update our offices and upgrade our retail tax preparation software. These investments have enabled our tax professionals to serve our clients better, which resulted in improved service metrics across the board, with walkouts and wait times down and satisfaction up. In fact, our Net Promoter Score increased 2 points this year. These initiatives will require continued investment, which we are committed to making, in order to improve our value proposition. \r\nFrom a marketing perspective, I'm very pleased with our campaign this year, which served as a reminder that taxes are complex and Americans leave over $1 billion of refunds on the table each year by not seeking professional assistance. Our simple message of Get Your Billion Back America resonated very well, and it showed in our results. \r\nIn digital, we enhanced the user experience by customizing the product to each client and making it simpler to use. By better anticipating the needs of our clients and tailoring the user experience, we saw improved conversion and a substantial increase in product upgrades. I'm pleased that the multi-year effort, that Jason Houseworth and his team have undertaken to redesign the online client experience, has been successful. We will continue to invest in our digital products to customize and simplify our offering, which will result in better retention, conversion and monetization. \r\nOn the Tax Plus side, our strategy is working, and I'm very pleased that we increased the overall proportion of clients who use our financial products. We made specific changes to how we position our Peace of Mind warranty life product. We're successful in increasing the take rate on our refund transfer product and effectively managed the Emerald Advance program to drive increased profits this year. \r\nWe also continued to see improved usage metrics in our Emerald Prepaid MasterCard, with reloader rates and average deposits higher in 2014. The net result of these efforts was an increase in revenues from our Tax Plus financial services products of 11% this year. \r\nOn the international front, we had solid seasons in Canada and Australia despite significant industry and macro challenges, including the extension of the Canadian tax season into May, considerable changes in the Australian tax law and the stronger U.S. dollar. Our teams did an outstanding job of working through these challenges, serving more clients overall and increasing revenues more than 5% on a local currency basis. \r\nAnd finally, we made progress this year in our health care initiatives. We demonstrated our expertise by providing a tax and health care review for our clients on the upcoming changes resulting from the Affordable Care Act. This effort to educate our clients over the past 2 seasons has positioned us as the trusted experts that our clients can rely on when navigating the intersection between taxes and health care. \r\nWe also successfully launched the partnership with GoHealth to provide health insurance enrollment services through online and assisted platforms. Through these efforts, we continue to learn about the needs of our clients and how we can better serve them in this area during the upcoming season and beyond. \r\nOur goals this year were to continue positioning H&R Block as the expert in health care and taxes, and to lay a foundation upon which we could build in future years, and we succeeded in these goals. \r\nIt's important to note that although the ACA begins to impact the tax event next year, it will take time for the health care and tax-preparation industries to fully adapt to these changes and for the ultimate opportunity to unfold. Though 8 million people enrolled through the exchanges in 2014, the CBO has estimated that full adoption will occur over the next several years, as individuals make decisions based on their perceived need for health care coverage, the overall cost and potential tax penalties associated with noncompliance. \r\nThat said, we know some of our clients will be significantly impacted by the Affordable Care Act and we believe they will naturally turn to their tax professional as the trusted source for help. We are working closely with the IRS and have our organization focused on integrating ACA-related changes into our work streams in order to successfully serve our clients next season. We look forward to sharing with you our thoughts and plans regarding the ACA, as the potential impact from this long-term opportunity becomes clearer. \r\nIn conclusion, we made considerable progress in 2014 toward our long-term objectives, and are well positioned for 2015 and beyond, as we remain committed to our Tax Plus strategy. We anticipated that our strategy, which focuses our resources on generating profitable growth, would result in declines and unprofitable return count and unit market share this year. The net result, however, is that we achieved exactly what we set out to do: Deliver higher revenue and earnings by improving return mix, enhancing client service and increasing the rate at which clients take our best-in-class financial services products. \r\nAdditionally, we made progress in our health care initiatives this year, educating our clients, improving our value proposition and positioning H&R Block as the leader in taxes and health care. I'm excited about the future of H&R Block, and look forward to a successful 2015.\r\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Greg to discuss further details of our fiscal 2014 financial results.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Bill, and good morning, everybody. From a financial perspective, we executed well, growing revenues and operating more productively, which drove improved margins, earnings and cash flows for the year. Total revenues increased $118 million, or 4%, to over $3 billion, and on a non -- on an adjusted non-GAAP basis, earnings per share from continuing operations increased 5%, to $1.67. \r\nOn a GAAP basis, our net income from continuing operations was up 7.5%, to $500 million, and our earnings per share from continuing operations increased 7.1% to $1.81. EBITDA margins expanded 1 point to 31%, with EBITDA increasing $66 million to $940 million. \r\nOn a quick side note, we report certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as EBITDA, which we find relevant in measuring our performance. The non-GAAP financial measures we use are based on well-defined, consistent and published standards, which you can find in our earnings release. \r\nIn our Tax Services segment, revenues increased to $121 million, or over 4%, to nearly $3 billion, due to improved mix and changes to our pricing strategy in our assisted channel, increased Tax Plus financial product revenues and product enhancements and improved monetization in our digital tax software.\r\nThe largest impact on total revenues came from an increase in U.S. assisted tax preparation fees and royalties, which grew 4%, to $2.1 billion, despite the overall decline in returns prepared. This increase is due to general price increases and an overall improvement in the mix of non-EZ clients. Additionally, the decision to discontinue our free federal 1040EZ promotion in virtually all markets, and other changes in our pricing strategy related to discounts and tax return extensions, contributed to the increase.\r\nLet me take a few moments to offer more details on each. Overall, we had a general price increase of approximately 3%, as well as an overall improvement in the mix of other non-EZ returns prepared. Next, as many of you know, the decision to discontinue the free federal 1040EZ promotion in virtually all markets impacted return counts, particularly related to less-complicated returns filed in the first half of the season. \r\nBefore, coming into the season, we thoroughly analyzed the results of our free 1040EZ promotion from prior years and I'd like to provide some additional insight behind our thought process and our decision to discontinue the promotion. First, we know our free EZ clients quite well and recognize that they have historically been more price sensitive and less loyal than other clients. Second, because these returns were prepared for free, this was volume in which we made little or no profit in prior years. Third, our analysis shows the majority of these clients were not likely to be eligible for an advanced tax credit in future years under the Affordable Care Act. As such, we did not believe the decision regarding the 1040EZ promotion would have a significant impact on our efforts regarding the health care reform opportunity. \r\nFinally, by offering our service for free during 1 of the 2 busiest times of the year, we were essentially stressing our system, increasing wait times that may have deterred paying clients from completing their returns with us. The end result was that there were -- we were giving our service away for free to clients who were not loyal and provided limited lifetime value to the detriment of our paying clients. \r\nConsidering the support expertise in Tax Plus financial services products provided to our clients, our 1040EZ offering is truly the best in the industry. So this year, we decided to charge tax-preparation fees for 1040EZ returns at a fair price that is competitive within the industry. This decision also freed capacity in our tax offices, allowing us to better serve our clients, leading to improved net promoter scores for the season. From a revenue standpoint, the decision to eliminate the 1040 free EZ promotion resulted in a one-time increase of over $30 million in 2014, despite the decline in returns.\r\nThe final driver of increased tax preparation and royalty revenue came from targeted one-time changes to our pricing strategy for a limited number of clients who are receiving significant discount that were not service break-driven. Such discounts had served as a drag on our top line performance in prior years.\r\nWe also began charging for extensions. And for those clients who found extension through us and then come back to file their tax return, this charge will be netted against their total tax preparation fees. Collectively, these and related decisions increased revenues by approximately $50 million this year. \r\nTurning to Tax Plus, as Bill mentioned earlier, our strategy is working. Revenues related to Tax Plus financial products increased $44 million, or 11%, to $432 million, primarily due to pricing changes in the company's refund transfer offering, increased revenues in our Peace of Mind warranty life product, and increased usage and average deposits per card on our award-winning Emerald Card product. \r\nOverall, a greater proportion of our clients are taking at least one financial product during a tax event, and those taking 2 or more products increased as well. With respect to our Emerald Card, while volumes were impacted by our decision to discontinue the free federal 1040EZ promotion, I am pleased that we were able to make significant progress in card usage. Average revenue per card increased 13% to $44, driven by double-digit increases in both reloader rates and deposits per card. Looking ahead, the Emerald Card continues to represent opportunity for us, and we will continue our focus on driving more cards and more usage.\r\nTurning to expenses. Total tax segment expenses increased at a lower rate than revenues, up 2.9%, to $2.1 billion. This increase was driven primarily by increased compensation and benefits, including variable wages resulting from higher tax prep fees, higher depreciation and amortization expenses in investment and growth initiatives, such as the health care opportunity arising from the Affordable Care Act. Importantly, we were able to offset these expense increases in other areas, and I'm pleased that we were able to drive margin expansion while continuing to make investments in the business.\r\nIn our corporate segment, our pretax loss improved by $20 million, or 17%, to $99 million. This improvement is primarily due to a nonrecurring gain from the sale of residual interests in mortgage loan securitizations that were owned by Sand Canyon Corporation. Corporate expenses declined by $7.6 million, primarily due to lower interest expense.\r\nOur effective tax rate was 34.8%, due to discrete tax adjustments related to tax settlements and adjustment of reserves taken on uncertain tax positions in prior years. Although we have now had 2 consecutive years of significant discrete benefits, we don't anticipate such benefits next year. Thus, our overall effective tax rate will likely increase, but will be lower than pre-fiscal 2013 rates.\r\nLooking at our overall financial position, our balance sheet and liquidity remains strong. As of April 30, total unrestricted cash was $2.2 billion, and total outstanding debt was $906 million. Cash flows from operations continued to increase as we continue to focus on smart profitable business and operational efficiencies.\r\nAs mentioned on our call in April, to discuss the exit at the bank, we expect to have considerable amount of excess capital on our balance sheet following the closing of the bank transaction. It is the current sense of the board and management to use this capital and also incur some incremental net debt to return capital to shareholders, such as through share repurchases, following consummation of the transaction. \r\nIn connection with incurring incremental net debt, there was also a current sense that there is value in maintaining investment-grade metrics. The excess capital is the result of several different actions. First, we have generated significant free cash flow net of dividends in each of the past 2 tax seasons. Second, as previously disclosed, upon the completion of the bank transaction, we will unlock capital that has been held at the bank, a portion of which will be immediately available. Third, there is still unused proceeds from the divestiture of RSM McGladrey. Finally, we've been efficient in managing our balance sheet over the past 24 months and through effective tax planning and other changes in our working capital needs, we freed additional capital. \r\nIn total, we expect to have between $850 million and $1 billion of excess capital on the balance sheet, once the bank transaction closes. Regarding the bank transaction itself, all required applications have been submitted to each party's respective regulators. As part of its review, the regulator presents the transaction for public comment. The public comment period is now closed and no comments were submitted. This is an important milestone in the process. And while we don't have additional updates to provide today on the bank transaction or our specific capital structure plans, we continue to expect that the bank transaction will close in time for next tax season. As always, we will provide updates as appropriate.\r\nAnother important component of our capital allocation strategy I'd like to discuss is the capital we invest back into the business. During the year, capital expenditures totaled $147 million, or 5% of total revenues. This exceeded our previous guidance of 4%, due to additional investments and office upgrades in information systems, which we felt were necessary due to underinvestment in these areas in prior years.\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, we believe further investments back into the business are appropriate to enable us to execute on our Tax Plus strategy in the medium and long term. Thus, we expect capital expenditures in fiscal year 2015 to be between 4% to 5% of revenues, with the return to normal levels of around 3% to 4% of revenues thereafter. \r\nMoving to discontinued operations, which include results of Sand Canyon, our net loss of $25 million was $6 million lower than the prior year. Sand Canyon continues to engage in settlement discussion with the counterparties from which it has received a significant majority of its asserted claims. Based on continued settlement discussions with these counterparties during the fourth quarter, Sand Canyon reported a provision of $25 million for potential losses related to its representation of warranty obligations, bringing the total accrual at April 30 to $184 million.\r\nAs a reminder, Sand Canyon is and always has been, operated as a separate legal entity from H&R Block. We believe our legal position is strong on any potential corporate veil piercing arguments.\r\nIn conclusion, from a financial perspective, we've delivered an exceptional year of revenue growth and margin expansion. And I'm pleased that we continue to find ways to operate more efficiently and productively. We have an exciting few years ahead of us, with substantial challenges taxpayers will face in dealing with an increasingly complex tax code. We're confident in our ability to help our clients navigate through these changes and we'll continue to make the appropriate investment to continue executing on our multi-year Tax Plus strategy. \r\nI know we've covered a lot in today's call, so with that, we're now ready for questions. Operator, please?",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Colby Brown (Executives)】\nThank you, Jana. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our fiscal 2014 results. Joining me on the call today are Bill Cobb, our President and CEO; and Greg Macfarlane, our CFO. Jason Houseworth, President, Global Digital and Product Management, will be available during the Q&A session.\r\nIn connection with this call, we have posted today's press release on the Investor Relations website at hrblock.com. Some of the figures that we'll discuss today are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We reconcile the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP figures and the schedules attached to our press release.\r\nBefore we begin our prepared remarks, I'd like to remind everyone that this call will include forward-looking statements as defined under the securities laws. Such statements are based on current information and management's expectations as of this date and are not guarantees of future performance.\r\nForward-looking statements involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. As a result, our actual outcomes and results could differ materially. You can learn more about these risks in our Form 10-K for fiscal 2013 and our other SEC filings. H&R Block undertakes no obligation to publicly update these risk factors or forward-looking statements.\r\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Bill.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: William Cobb (Executives)】\nThanks, Colby, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today we announced our financial results for fiscal year 2014. I'm very pleased with our results this year. We entered this season with a strong plan to achieve our Tax Plus objectives and we executed very well. In fiscal 2014, we enhanced our service levels, while improving return mix and increased attach rates on our best-in-class  Financial Services products.\r\nWe successfully launched the first year of our digital product redesign, enhancing the client experience. We continue to educate our clients on the upcoming changes resulting from health care reform and gain some key learnings from our health care initiatives that will serve us well going into 2015 and beyond. And most importantly, we served our clients better than ever.\r\nThe result of these efforts was that we grew revenue, expanded margins and improved our customer satisfaction, while also continuing to invest in our business. I'll provide a greater level of detail on our performance for the year, but before doing so, I'd like to provide some overall context on the tax season.\r\nAs many of you know, there was a lot of noise in the market this year due to the delayed opening of e-file, our decision to eliminate the free federal 1040EZ promotion and aggressive pricing actions from our digital competitors. Total IRS filings returned to historical norms and exceeded our expectations, with returns up 1.4% from last year. The assisted category as a whole was essentially flat, while total digital returns increased nearly 6%.\r\nThere are a few reasons for the difference in growth rates between the assisted and digital categories. First, we believe that our decision to discontinue the free 1040EZ promotion in virtually all markets contributed to the growth in digital returns this year, as low loyalty filers, motivated solely by price, moved to DIY methods where they could file for free. \r\nSecond, the digital category continues to benefit from the migration of pen and paper filers, though at a slower pace than in prior years. And third, based on our experience this year and consistent with industry results the past several years, we continue to believe there is an increased mix of digital returns filed with the Earned Income Credit, or EIC, due to the inconsistent fraud prevention standards in filing returns containing this credit.\r\nAs a reminder, the EIC is one of the largest government social programs in the country and the IRS estimated that approximately $13 billion to $15 billion of improper payments were made to the EIC in 2013. This is obviously a significant issue for the U.S. Treasury Department and for the country. In fact, under federal law, every government agency is required to disclose their highest risk financial transactions, and the EIC is the only risk noted on a consistent basis by the IRS. \r\nSeveral years ago, the IRS took actions to address this concern that were not comprehensive, creating standards only for returns prepared by a paid tax professional. Thus, current standards for filing a return with the EIC are different for assisted returns and DIY returns, which has resulted in a shift from assisted to DIY over the past 5 years. Importantly, the assisted category would've gained share during that time had there not been a shift in EIC filers.\r\nWe have taken an industry leadership position against tax fraud and continue to advocate for consistent standards in both assisted and DIY tax returns in all respects, and in particular, those that contain the EIC. Until such parity standards are in place, we believe the improper payment issue will persist and the industry will continue to see a shift in returns containing these credits from assisted to DIY.\r\nWith that overview in the industry, let's turn to our performance for the year. We executed very well against our multi-year Tax Plus strategy in 2014. You'll recall from our conference call in March and our Investor Day in December that we are squarely focused on this strategy, which is centered on delivering value for our clients and driving higher revenues and profits through a balance of improved return mix and increased product attachments. Put simply, we served our clients better than ever, and in the process drove profitable growth.\r\nIn retail, we discontinued our free 1040EZ promotion in virtually all our markets, which, as anticipated, contributed to a significant increase in revenues despite lower revenue counts -- lower return counts. We also made changes to our pricing this year to be more strategic in how and when we provide discounts and what we charge for filing extensions. Despite these price increases, retention of non-EZ filers was essentially flat for the year, continuing to outpace our branded retail competitors.\r\nAnother important element of our strategy was to improve how we serve our clients by making investments in our retail locations, technology and in our people. Specifically, we are nearing completion in our initiatives to update our offices and upgrade our retail tax preparation software. These investments have enabled our tax professionals to serve our clients better, which resulted in improved service metrics across the board, with walkouts and wait times down and satisfaction up. In fact, our Net Promoter Score increased 2 points this year. These initiatives will require continued investment, which we are committed to making, in order to improve our value proposition. \r\nFrom a marketing perspective, I'm very pleased with our campaign this year, which served as a reminder that taxes are complex and Americans leave over $1 billion of refunds on the table each year by not seeking professional assistance. Our simple message of Get Your Billion Back America resonated very well, and it showed in our results. \r\nIn digital, we enhanced the user experience by customizing the product to each client and making it simpler to use. By better anticipating the needs of our clients and tailoring the user experience, we saw improved conversion and a substantial increase in product upgrades. I'm pleased that the multi-year effort, that Jason Houseworth and his team have undertaken to redesign the online client experience, has been successful. We will continue to invest in our digital products to customize and simplify our offering, which will result in better retention, conversion and monetization. \r\nOn the Tax Plus side, our strategy is working, and I'm very pleased that we increased the overall proportion of clients who use our financial products. We made specific changes to how we position our Peace of Mind warranty life product. We're successful in increasing the take rate on our refund transfer product and effectively managed the Emerald Advance program to drive increased profits this year. \r\nWe also continued to see improved usage metrics in our Emerald Prepaid MasterCard, with reloader rates and average deposits higher in 2014. The net result of these efforts was an increase in revenues from our Tax Plus financial services products of 11% this year. \r\nOn the international front, we had solid seasons in Canada and Australia despite significant industry and macro challenges, including the extension of the Canadian tax season into May, considerable changes in the Australian tax law and the stronger U.S. dollar. Our teams did an outstanding job of working through these challenges, serving more clients overall and increasing revenues more than 5% on a local currency basis. \r\nAnd finally, we made progress this year in our health care initiatives. We demonstrated our expertise by providing a tax and health care review for our clients on the upcoming changes resulting from the Affordable Care Act. This effort to educate our clients over the past 2 seasons has positioned us as the trusted experts that our clients can rely on when navigating the intersection between taxes and health care. \r\nWe also successfully launched the partnership with GoHealth to provide health insurance enrollment services through online and assisted platforms. Through these efforts, we continue to learn about the needs of our clients and how we can better serve them in this area during the upcoming season and beyond. \r\nOur goals this year were to continue positioning H&R Block as the expert in health care and taxes, and to lay a foundation upon which we could build in future years, and we succeeded in these goals. \r\nIt's important to note that although the ACA begins to impact the tax event next year, it will take time for the health care and tax-preparation industries to fully adapt to these changes and for the ultimate opportunity to unfold. Though 8 million people enrolled through the exchanges in 2014, the CBO has estimated that full adoption will occur over the next several years, as individuals make decisions based on their perceived need for health care coverage, the overall cost and potential tax penalties associated with noncompliance. \r\nThat said, we know some of our clients will be significantly impacted by the Affordable Care Act and we believe they will naturally turn to their tax professional as the trusted source for help. We are working closely with the IRS and have our organization focused on integrating ACA-related changes into our work streams in order to successfully serve our clients next season. We look forward to sharing with you our thoughts and plans regarding the ACA, as the potential impact from this long-term opportunity becomes clearer. \r\nIn conclusion, we made considerable progress in 2014 toward our long-term objectives, and are well positioned for 2015 and beyond, as we remain committed to our Tax Plus strategy. We anticipated that our strategy, which focuses our resources on generating profitable growth, would result in declines and unprofitable return count and unit market share this year. The net result, however, is that we achieved exactly what we set out to do: Deliver higher revenue and earnings by improving return mix, enhancing client service and increasing the rate at which clients take our best-in-class financial services products. \r\nAdditionally, we made progress in our health care initiatives this year, educating our clients, improving our value proposition and positioning H&R Block as the leader in taxes and health care. I'm excited about the future of H&R Block, and look forward to a successful 2015.\r\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Greg to discuss further details of our fiscal 2014 financial results.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nThanks, Bill, and good morning, everybody. From a financial perspective, we executed well, growing revenues and operating more productively, which drove improved margins, earnings and cash flows for the year. Total revenues increased $118 million, or 4%, to over $3 billion, and on a non -- on an adjusted non-GAAP basis, earnings per share from continuing operations increased 5%, to $1.67. \r\nOn a GAAP basis, our net income from continuing operations was up 7.5%, to $500 million, and our earnings per share from continuing operations increased 7.1% to $1.81. EBITDA margins expanded 1 point to 31%, with EBITDA increasing $66 million to $940 million. \r\nOn a quick side note, we report certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as EBITDA, which we find relevant in measuring our performance. The non-GAAP financial measures we use are based on well-defined, consistent and published standards, which you can find in our earnings release. \r\nIn our Tax Services segment, revenues increased to $121 million, or over 4%, to nearly $3 billion, due to improved mix and changes to our pricing strategy in our assisted channel, increased Tax Plus financial product revenues and product enhancements and improved monetization in our digital tax software.\r\nThe largest impact on total revenues came from an increase in U.S. assisted tax preparation fees and royalties, which grew 4%, to $2.1 billion, despite the overall decline in returns prepared. This increase is due to general price increases and an overall improvement in the mix of non-EZ clients. Additionally, the decision to discontinue our free federal 1040EZ promotion in virtually all markets, and other changes in our pricing strategy related to discounts and tax return extensions, contributed to the increase.\r\nLet me take a few moments to offer more details on each. Overall, we had a general price increase of approximately 3%, as well as an overall improvement in the mix of other non-EZ returns prepared. Next, as many of you know, the decision to discontinue the free federal 1040EZ promotion in virtually all markets impacted return counts, particularly related to less-complicated returns filed in the first half of the season. \r\nBefore, coming into the season, we thoroughly analyzed the results of our free 1040EZ promotion from prior years and I'd like to provide some additional insight behind our thought process and our decision to discontinue the promotion. First, we know our free EZ clients quite well and recognize that they have historically been more price sensitive and less loyal than other clients. Second, because these returns were prepared for free, this was volume in which we made little or no profit in prior years. Third, our analysis shows the majority of these clients were not likely to be eligible for an advanced tax credit in future years under the Affordable Care Act. As such, we did not believe the decision regarding the 1040EZ promotion would have a significant impact on our efforts regarding the health care reform opportunity. \r\nFinally, by offering our service for free during 1 of the 2 busiest times of the year, we were essentially stressing our system, increasing wait times that may have deterred paying clients from completing their returns with us. The end result was that there were -- we were giving our service away for free to clients who were not loyal and provided limited lifetime value to the detriment of our paying clients. \r\nConsidering the support expertise in Tax Plus financial services products provided to our clients, our 1040EZ offering is truly the best in the industry. So this year, we decided to charge tax-preparation fees for 1040EZ returns at a fair price that is competitive within the industry. This decision also freed capacity in our tax offices, allowing us to better serve our clients, leading to improved net promoter scores for the season. From a revenue standpoint, the decision to eliminate the 1040 free EZ promotion resulted in a one-time increase of over $30 million in 2014, despite the decline in returns.\r\nThe final driver of increased tax preparation and royalty revenue came from targeted one-time changes to our pricing strategy for a limited number of clients who are receiving significant discount that were not service break-driven. Such discounts had served as a drag on our top line performance in prior years.\r\nWe also began charging for extensions. And for those clients who found extension through us and then come back to file their tax return, this charge will be netted against their total tax preparation fees. Collectively, these and related decisions increased revenues by approximately $50 million this year. \r\nTurning to Tax Plus, as Bill mentioned earlier, our strategy is working. Revenues related to Tax Plus financial products increased $44 million, or 11%, to $432 million, primarily due to pricing changes in the company's refund transfer offering, increased revenues in our Peace of Mind warranty life product, and increased usage and average deposits per card on our award-winning Emerald Card product. \r\nOverall, a greater proportion of our clients are taking at least one financial product during a tax event, and those taking 2 or more products increased as well. With respect to our Emerald Card, while volumes were impacted by our decision to discontinue the free federal 1040EZ promotion, I am pleased that we were able to make significant progress in card usage. Average revenue per card increased 13% to $44, driven by double-digit increases in both reloader rates and deposits per card. Looking ahead, the Emerald Card continues to represent opportunity for us, and we will continue our focus on driving more cards and more usage.\r\nTurning to expenses. Total tax segment expenses increased at a lower rate than revenues, up 2.9%, to $2.1 billion. This increase was driven primarily by increased compensation and benefits, including variable wages resulting from higher tax prep fees, higher depreciation and amortization expenses in investment and growth initiatives, such as the health care opportunity arising from the Affordable Care Act. Importantly, we were able to offset these expense increases in other areas, and I'm pleased that we were able to drive margin expansion while continuing to make investments in the business.\r\nIn our corporate segment, our pretax loss improved by $20 million, or 17%, to $99 million. This improvement is primarily due to a nonrecurring gain from the sale of residual interests in mortgage loan securitizations that were owned by Sand Canyon Corporation. Corporate expenses declined by $7.6 million, primarily due to lower interest expense.\r\nOur effective tax rate was 34.8%, due to discrete tax adjustments related to tax settlements and adjustment of reserves taken on uncertain tax positions in prior years. Although we have now had 2 consecutive years of significant discrete benefits, we don't anticipate such benefits next year. Thus, our overall effective tax rate will likely increase, but will be lower than pre-fiscal 2013 rates.\r\nLooking at our overall financial position, our balance sheet and liquidity remains strong. As of April 30, total unrestricted cash was $2.2 billion, and total outstanding debt was $906 million. Cash flows from operations continued to increase as we continue to focus on smart profitable business and operational efficiencies.\r\nAs mentioned on our call in April, to discuss the exit at the bank, we expect to have considerable amount of excess capital on our balance sheet following the closing of the bank transaction. It is the current sense of the board and management to use this capital and also incur some incremental net debt to return capital to shareholders, such as through share repurchases, following consummation of the transaction. \r\nIn connection with incurring incremental net debt, there was also a current sense that there is value in maintaining investment-grade metrics. The excess capital is the result of several different actions. First, we have generated significant free cash flow net of dividends in each of the past 2 tax seasons. Second, as previously disclosed, upon the completion of the bank transaction, we will unlock capital that has been held at the bank, a portion of which will be immediately available. Third, there is still unused proceeds from the divestiture of RSM McGladrey. Finally, we've been efficient in managing our balance sheet over the past 24 months and through effective tax planning and other changes in our working capital needs, we freed additional capital. \r\nIn total, we expect to have between $850 million and $1 billion of excess capital on the balance sheet, once the bank transaction closes. Regarding the bank transaction itself, all required applications have been submitted to each party's respective regulators. As part of its review, the regulator presents the transaction for public comment. The public comment period is now closed and no comments were submitted. This is an important milestone in the process. And while we don't have additional updates to provide today on the bank transaction or our specific capital structure plans, we continue to expect that the bank transaction will close in time for next tax season. As always, we will provide updates as appropriate.\r\nAnother important component of our capital allocation strategy I'd like to discuss is the capital we invest back into the business. During the year, capital expenditures totaled $147 million, or 5% of total revenues. This exceeded our previous guidance of 4%, due to additional investments and office upgrades in information systems, which we felt were necessary due to underinvestment in these areas in prior years.\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, we believe further investments back into the business are appropriate to enable us to execute on our Tax Plus strategy in the medium and long term. Thus, we expect capital expenditures in fiscal year 2015 to be between 4% to 5% of revenues, with the return to normal levels of around 3% to 4% of revenues thereafter. \r\nMoving to discontinued operations, which include results of Sand Canyon, our net loss of $25 million was $6 million lower than the prior year. Sand Canyon continues to engage in settlement discussion with the counterparties from which it has received a significant majority of its asserted claims. Based on continued settlement discussions with these counterparties during the fourth quarter, Sand Canyon reported a provision of $25 million for potential losses related to its representation of warranty obligations, bringing the total accrual at April 30 to $184 million.\r\nAs a reminder, Sand Canyon is and always has been, operated as a separate legal entity from H&R Block. We believe our legal position is strong on any potential corporate veil piercing arguments.\r\nIn conclusion, from a financial perspective, we've delivered an exceptional year of revenue growth and margin expansion. And I'm pleased that we continue to find ways to operate more efficiently and productively. We have an exciting few years ahead of us, with substantial challenges taxpayers will face in dealing with an increasingly complex tax code. We're confident in our ability to help our clients navigate through these changes and we'll continue to make the appropriate investment to continue executing on our multi-year Tax Plus strategy. \r\nI know we've covered a lot in today's call, so with that, we're now ready for questions. Operator, please?",
      "transcript_text3": "You made -- you gave us a lot of great commentary about the market this year and what helped you drive the revenue increases. As you look to next year, you already gave us a hint that you think that as long as EIC is not handled at the digital level, there should be still some shift in volumes there. But in terms of the pricing actions that you took this year, is that -- did you come away from the season feeling that you've now exercised that muscle, or do you feel that you could go into next year and make some more moves like that and refine your pricing in some other places to get the similar kind of benefit?\n\n---\n\nSo Gil, here's what I would say. First of all, I'm not going to talk about next year. We're still digesting this year, running our overall analytics, and next year will be next year. But we continue to work vigorously on the EIC issue and trying to get parity between the documentation requirements, between assisted and DIY. So again, I wouldn't say that we have much of a comment on any of those points except to say that we have a lot of months between now and the next tax season, and we'll certainly have updates for you as we get toward Investor Day in December.\n\n---\n\nFair enough. And then the excess capital of $850 million to $1 billion, does that include the ability to add leverage or is that just the calculation you went through of where you would be after a bank sale without taking on additional debt?\n\n---\n\nThe $850 million to $1 billion number that we talked about earlier is just excess capital and it is independent of any potential additional leverage that we may want to get into.\n\n---\n\nSome housekeeping things. How many racks [ph] did you do this year? And then how -- why was Peace of Mind revenue up so much? And then, can you just talk a little bit about Emerald Advance, revenue was down, but that was down [indiscernible]. Can -- just what do you do in terms of strategy there?\n\n---\n\nYes, I'll let Greg run through the numbers, but we had a very considered strategy around -- as we talked about in December, around what we call Tax Plus. It was stamped on the head of every field leader, every office leader. Jason and his team in digital did a terrific job on that. And so Tax Plus really became a real operating approach for us throughout the company, so that's why you see the numbers that we talked about that contributed to Peace of Mind. With regard to Emerald Advance, I think we just managed the overall process well in terms of our underwriting, our collections, et cetera. So we're pleased with the effort there and we think we had a very controlled approach and had a successful season. Greg, is there something -- anything you want to add?\n\n---\n\nYes, so the question you asked, Thomas, we did $5.5 million refund transfers this past season, and then I agree very much with what Bill said. The Peace of Mind is a great product. It's a product that has not received a lot of attention here at Block for many years. And under our Tax Plus strategy, we did pay some attention to it and you got to see the kind of results that would happen from that, which I think is really good news.\n\n---\n\nAnd then on the marketing front, you guys obviously had a very poignant marketing campaign this year. I know its interesting to see that you spent less this year than you did last year. Do you think this is sustainable or were there kind of one-time things going on there?\n\n---\n\nYes, I mean, obviously, when you have the kind of campaign we have, the awareness we generated in a very short amount of time and the consideration that everyone recognizes this was H&R Block, and you get a lot of bang for your buck there. Again, not going to comment on marketing strategy going forward or level of spending, but I think we're pleased with the way the campaign was received, the way we bought our media, we bought it very efficiently and so overall, I think it was a win all around.\n\n---\n\nOkay, I'm going to try to squeeze 2 more quick ones in here. Just on the bank sale, once you do sell the banks, how do you plan to telegraph your capital return plan? Do you expect this to kind of start executing on buybacks? I know you have $858 million on your authorization or do you think you'll lay out a plan? And then second question is you announced in April a strategic alliance with Xero. Can you just kind of give us some more color around that, I don't think you guys have really talked about it.\n\n---\n\nI'm not sure we're going to use a telegraph, Thomas, but I will let Greg take those 2 questions.\n\n---\n\nYes, so I'll start with the bank first. I mean, there's not real much new news here. I mean, I think it was good that the public commentary came and went. Really, everything sits with the regulator right now, and the regulators, plural I should say, and they have a process they follow on this good communication, going back and forth between them and us and B of I. But as I said in the prepared comments, we are -- continue to believe that the best estimate is to this in place for next tax season. Ideally, we'd like to get it done as soon as possible, but there is a process and timeline that's going to have to work out here. There's always risk, though, when you're working with regulators. Their timelines are different. Their decisions may not be what we want, but we still -- that's what we've -- kind of our best estimate is. As things develop -- at the point which material things come up, we would share those with you as we have, that's our normal practice. On the Xero comment, or the Xero question, so Xero, if those of you on the phone are not familiar with Xero, it's X-E-R-O. You can go to their website at xero.com. It's a great company and we have -- Block have been in the business services, small business accounting business for a long time. And it's not an area that's received a lot of attention, it's not really that big. And we have been thinking about what is kind of the next way to reinvigorate that and we began thinking about the software and the service offering that we provide to our clients. And we found Xero and they really have developed what they would describe as beautiful software, and it would be a software that we would use as part of our value proposition to our clients and new clients. So it's a new venture. I would say that we're hopeful, but it's going to take time to build into that, so I wouldn't get too excited by it in the short term.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And so just to elaborate on the first question, once you -- the bank sale is done, how are you going to communicate to the street kind of your capital return plan?\n\n---\n\nYes, so we haven't -- I mean, these are questions that are always contingent upon getting the approval from the regulators, so Job 1 is to get approval at a regulator. We're not sitting idly here at Block for that to happen, but these are things that have to go between our Board of Directors, and then we have to think about it. But my kind of answer, ultimately, is going to be at the appropriate time, we'll share those decisions and timelines with you.\n\n---\n\nGreg, I think in your prepared remarks, you said a price increase of 3%. And I'm wondering, is that 3% excluding the 1040EZ, or is that 3% include the 1040EZ pricing change you've had this year?\n\n---\n\nIt's excluding, Kartik.\n\n---\n\nSo excluding the 1040EZ, all other forms you had a 3% price increase, and that does not include anything you would do on the racks side or any of the other Tax Plus products, correct?\n\n---\n\nYes. The 3% that we communicated would be really -- think of it as a base form increase. Nothing to do with the products, the additional taxes.\n\n---\n\nAnd I think, Kartik, just for a little bit more context on that. I think what we're -- what Greg was trying to do in his script was really give you context for some of the operating decisions we took around free 1040. We didn't raise prices 12% or in that neighborhood, or 10%. We wanted to give you some color around the dimension of that, so that's why. But if you just wanted to, \"Look at what might be called general pricing,\" that's what the 3% refers to.\n\n---\n\nAnd Bill, what will your digital strategy next year be if Intuit goes along with their half price date, like they did this year, I know you tested that a little bit. Would your strategy change at all, is your thought that you're going to continue on the same path as you did this year?\n\n---\n\nSo, Jason, why don't we reveal our strategy for 2015 on digital? Kartik, you know we're not going to do that. But why don't I let Jason kind of give his perspective, which is, I think, always helpful. We're not going to get into next year, but I want him to talk a little bit about how we're viewing things.\n\n---\n\nThanks for your question, Kartik, this is Jason. So I'll remind you just how we started this season, which was in year 1 of a 2-year redesign, which was a ground-up redesign focused on creating a mobile first and personalized product experience. And within this, our focus was to figure out how can we continue to improve conversion, improve retention and monetization on our average revenue per user through an enhanced value perception and customization that the redesign creates. So for this tax season, we really had a plan to begin to realize part of the benefits of this redesign and we executed this plan. We continue to improve our conversion and, more importantly, as Bill noted, we saw substantial improvement in online monetization, and that was specifically from gains in free to basic or free to paid upgrades, delivering double-digit revenue growth for the digital business. As far as pricing, we're always testing in order to figure out the right way to monetize and the right way to create an experience that's going to improve our overall product. And we continue to do that and that will be factored into our product strategy, as it always does.\n\n---\n\nSo, Bill, maybe, a question you might be able to give more -- a bigger answer to -- a better answer to would be the Phoenix project. I know you tested some stores in Phoenix with GoHealth. I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about how those went and maybe what you learned, and if you'll be able to be expand on that.\n\n---\n\nYes, and I'll let Jason weigh in. Mark Ciaramitaro, who many of you met at Investor Day, runs our health care business, reports into Jason, so Jason is very intimately involved with the health care business also. So that's our enrollment service. We ran 3 pilots last year, Phoenix was one of them, kind of the in-store piece. Again, not ready to comment on how we go forward, but suffice to say that I think we learned a lot. We certainly enrolled thousands of people. And I think our service, our user experience, we got high marks from -- in terms of this being a guided experience versus just going through the exchange. There's a lot of things we're still unfolding in realtime, so it was a little bit of a lumpy season really based on more external than ourselves. But we're very pleased with how our teams executed against it. I don't know if there's anything you want to add to that, Jason.\n\n---\n\nI think that what I would add is, Bill talked about trying to figure out how do we add valuable service to our clients. But specifically, we were trying to figure out what's the model that best fits into our overall business. And we looked at a -- we were really testing a number of factors, like relevancy, various operational aspects and even our marketing approach, and we feel like that we gained insights that we can really apply to our offerings in this tax season, and we'll discuss this in more detail in December on our Investor Day.\n\n---\n\nBill, you touched on pricing on the 3% figure. Could you give us some color as to -- is that a normalized pricing number we should think about on a go-forward basis? I know you mentioned you're going to be strategic about pricing. Just curious how we should think about that number on a go-forward basis. And is the portfolio pruning over or do you have more pruning to do as you look forward?\n\n---\n\nSo let me take that, Greg, and if you want to add anything. So in terms of -- I think we've indicated on -- Greg does a great job with our investment thesis. That, generally, we believe pricing actions in the 2% to 3% range would be consistent with what investors could expect. So I think we're within that -- we're on the higher end of the range. This past year, we've been on the lower end. I still think that, Greg, I think you agree that will probably hold as a go-forward, and obviously we'll talk about that more. But I think that's consistent with what we've said going forward. As far as additional pruning, I assume you're talking from a corporate perspective. We are very committed -- obviously, we have the bank deal, which we talked about and you're all very familiar with. But, no, I think we have the company we want to have, we have the strategy we want to have with Tax Plus, so this is our go forward. We've got all of our field leaders in this week, we've been meeting with them. We are, again, way ahead of where we were last year in terms of planning. So Tax Plus, as I said earlier, stamped in everyone's forehead and that's how we're going forward.\n\n---\n\nLet me just comment on the -- there was a pruning question that I wanted to kind of just focus a couple of comments on. So, Bill, said the main point, which is we, in our industry, enjoy low price elasticity that's not changing. We know a lot about that. What we're trying to do is evolve pricing from, I think, what has been historically at Block and at least in the last several years, as a tactical weapon and make it more of a strategic opportunity for us. And so the things that we changed this year were more about getting a system aligned to what we're trying to do more at the macro level. And so those were the outputs, which in this case were very positive in terms of revenue, were good outcomes from that. But that wasn't the goal, necessarily, of the things -- the changes that we made. So we're going to continue to think strategically about pricing, knowing fundamentally that there's price elasticity in this business, but also, fundamentally, that we're going to be here another 60 years and we have to think about the client, what's the right thing for the client over their lifetime.\n\n---\n\nRight. And, Greg, just a question on your investment grade comment. Do you know that there's value in the investment grade? Could you maybe walk us through the rationale of how there is value for your business within investment grade? And you also said, \"We're not going to sit idle for the bank sale to close. We're going to continue to work.\" Any conversations you've had with the rating agencies and maybe talk about how they're going to look at your business differently? The investment grade, it can mean a lot of different things in different businesses, so any color around those comments would be very helpful.\n\n---\n\nYes, okay. So we do talk to the rating agencies on a regular basis. We've got good relationships established with Standard & Poor's and Moody's. As you can expect and appreciate, getting our 2014 financial results finalized is an important part of the discussion, as we shape what's likely to be a busy 12 months ahead of us if our timelines hold up as it relates to the regulatory process and so on. But that's really the extent of the conversations. Because, really -- and so we're kind of past the rates or the approval process and getting the closing process finalized. It would be premature for us, I think, to get too specific with the rating agencies. In terms of the justification behind investment grade. What we said before, I'm just going to say again, is we at Block, over the last several years in conjunction with the board and a lot of external health, have looked at all the considerations that most companies would look at. And then the unique aspects of Block around our seasonality and our history, and the conclusion was that investment grade is the right place for us. But we haven't really gone much further than saying exactly what that means at this point in time. But as things develop, we'll update you at the appropriate time.\n\n---\n\nHamzah, let me add a little more perspective on this, and this is more, if you will, from my chair. Because I think there's a lot of talk around investment grade and I want to make sure everyone understands what we're saying. We have been very clear that upon the completion of the bank process, we are looking at returning capital to shareholders as we had done -- I'm only going to talk about the time that I've been here, that we had done previously, when we raised the dividend 33% and bought back 12% of the shares. So we want to have a return of capital. We indicated today that our excess capital expectations are approaching $1 billion. And as Greg mentioned earlier, we will take on incremental net debt beyond where we are today as part of that return process. What I've tried to do is be very deliberate, thoughtful, et cetera. And investment grade is obviously a decision any company faces, our liquidity needs are real. So I think shareholders are going to be very pleased, as we go through this process, that the combination of incremental net debt plus the excess capital return will be very shareholder-friendly or whatever term you want to use. And that, I think, that we can balance everything and I think it's very consistent with the approach I've tried to take to the company. And obviously, we're going to be -- as Greg indicated earlier, we're planning on being here for 60 years or so. So we're going to manage this company with both an eye toward an event like that, but also with an eye toward the long term.\n\n---\n\nThat's very helpful, I appreciate that color. Just one last question, I'll turn it over. The pushout of the tax season in Canada, or the extension, any idea how much revenue that is pushed out? I know Canada is not massive for you, but any quantification of that?\n\n---\n\nI'm glad you asked that because it was actually an interesting little wrinkle to this year. But with the Heartbleed security, we can set -- everyone's probably familiar with the Canadian taxing authority. The CRA essentially said we're going to shut down and set the e-files would -- turned out to be 5 whole days. And the message that was delivered to the taxpayer in Canada was really received as we're kind of -- there's no need to file your taxes until we tell you to. And as a result of that decision, the CRA, the Canadian Revenue Authority, extended the tax season for all intents and purposes an extra 5 days. So it went from April 30 normally to May 5, so we were actually calling it April 35 this year. And so that resulted in us having to keep our stores open longer, 5 extra days, staffing them. We actually spent additional marketing money behind that. There were a lot of operational things that, frankly, the Canadian team really did a great job with. But in terms of specifically quantifying that, we're not going to get that level of detail with you, it's just -- it's not material. We don't disclose that level of detail.\n\n---\n\nA few questions. Bill, I'd like to start off, this is a reask of something we've heard already. But just your level of conviction on growing revenue going forward, was that a 1-year strategy? You touched on what you think is an appropriate rate increase as we go forward. I think everyone is just kind of wondering, might we see something where you go back and grab market share? So just trying to gauge the conviction on the multi-year strategy around that.\n\n---\n\nYes, I mean, you know the answer I'll give you, we're not going to get into the specifics. But let me just try to answer your question specifically or from a strategic point of view. We, ultimately, want to grow our revenue and that does include -- there are various ways you can grow revenue and it's price and mix and unit volume, et cetera, and we will look at all of those levers as we look to go forward. But the emphasis on -- that we indicated this year that I talked about with our field leaders this year, continues to be Tax Plus revenue growth. So that will be the focus as we go forward, and that is the emphasis. We think we have best-in-class financial services products, so attaching those products to our clients, servicing them, providing that value is an important part of our story. So I don't know if that specifically answers your question, but, yes, we will be very focused on that, again, as we go forward.\n\n---\n\nAnd one of you mentioned earlier in the presentation that the folks that were 1040EZ that you changed pricing on this year are not really a core ACA target, and I was just hoping you could elaborate a little bit on that. And then, the second part of the question would be, any discussion on what you're seeing in form creation for ACA that could -- any early insights into next year? So it's 2-parter.\n\n---\n\nSo let me take the first part, and then, Jason, do you want to talk about the form -- the situation of forms? I think, again, we're learning about this. We still don't have a lot of data other than the 8 million enrollee number. We don't know how many people are staying in, paying, et cetera. So there's still a lot that needs to happen there, specifically the 1040EZ, a number of very low-income people actually would not be subsidy eligible because they're Medicaid eligible, and that puts them into, in effect, a different category. So while you would think right away everybody would be subsidy eligible, it gets a little tricky, especially when it comes to the Medicaid aspect, and then there are different states who handle Medicaid in different ways. So that's why it's not a simple 1040EZ equals Affordable Care Act enrollees. It's actually -- it gets cut down pretty significantly from that. So again, the whole health care discussion, you've heard us say this numerous times, I think we are well positioned, I think we understand this better than anybody, but this opportunity is going to unfold over the next several years. Now specific to the forms, Jason, do you want to talk about broadly what's going on there?\n\n---\n\nSure. Thanks for your question, Scott. So the IRS hasn't released the final forms or instructions related to ACA, but we do hope to get these details later this summer. What the IRS has shared with us and the industry is that, first, there will be a new reconciliation form, Form 8962, in order to reconcile the advance tax credit. And we also know that there will be a 1095 series of notices to taxpayers, with the 1095A from the health care marketplace, which is required to do a reconciliation, and then the 1095-B and C, which are voluntary for employers and insurance companies. Which means that clients who may not receive a 1095-B or C will actually have to settle for tests for insurance coverage for their household. And then, finally, there will likely be a combined penalty and exemption worksheet. We think this will be the 8965. It will be required to be e-filed with the return for people that have to calculate their penalty or qualify for an exemption. And we know many of the exception reasons today, but there will likely be more in the final instructions when the IRS provides the final version of this worksheet.\n\n---\n\nA few more if I may. On -- you guys outperformed your EBITDA margin versus last year. Your goal was to come in at about the same, so congratulations on that. Just curious, your long-term 32% is the high-end of the range and you're obviously trending well. Greg, an update, if any, on how you're feeling about that long term, and what shape or form would it come? Would it become a -- coming on expense management or more leveraging the top line?\n\n---\n\nSo we're likely to talk about this, obviously, in December. It's has been kind of more of what we've been doing in the last few years. But I think, just a broad thought I would share with you is, our objective is not to maximize margin percentage, but it's to maximize, obviously, revenue growth and then net income dollars at the end of it at acceptable levels of margin percentage. And so, we'll continue to think about that. But as, also, I shared -- we shared with you, and as can see in our numbers, we decided to increase the investment this year into the business. We did that last year, too. Those were actually higher than we originally thought, which is actually a good thing. Because the investments we're making, I think, are smart for the medium and long term, but that's going to have a natural pressure going into next year. We're going to have the bank transaction ideally done, that's going to have impact on margins next year. So we have to digest that plus other things. But in terms of a range, at this point we've guided historically to 27% to 32%. We were 30% last year, we were above that this year, and that's a good thing. But we've not -- we're not, at this point, prepared to change that range.\n\n---\n\nAnd then 2 more I'll -- they're separate questions, but just to sneak them in. One, I'd love to hear about the Sand Canyon accrual increase and how you're going on tolling agreements, that's sounds like an interesting update. And then the last one, hopefully you'll touch on a little bit. But the comments on incremental net debt going forward, would love to hear initial thoughts on shape or form of that net debt.\n\n---\n\nI'll give those both over to Greg.\n\n---\n\nSo, Sand Canyon continues to be in discussions with the majority of its counterparties that have made rep and warranty claims. They operate those specifically with tolling arrangements, which are -- is really just an agreement to say let's put the clock, the stature of limitations on hold while we have productive conversations. And those conversations continue to develop, and that's why the tolling arrangements continue to be in place. And so I've always viewed that as a good thing. The fact that the reserve was adjusted upwards, I don't believe it was a huge number, is an indication that there's progress being made in my view, so I saw it as a good step forward. Because I think -- well, at least I can speak for management, the objective here is to help -- to really allow Sand Canyon to wind down at the fairest and orderly way, and that's probably going to -- will still take years at this point. But the fact they're able to see -- make forward progress is a good thing. The second question's really on the incremental net debt. At this point, we're not going to talk very specifically about that. We've indicated that we're prepared to take incremental net debt. It will be involved at the point at which the bank transactions closed. And then at the point which we have more information, we'll share that with you.\n\n---\n\nMaybe you can discuss some of the differences in terms of monetization or lack of monetization between the EZs and the free online and semi-free online products that the industry has been using.\n\n---\n\nYes, so the EZ clan piece -- we're talking very specifically, Mike, about the people that come to our stores that were under the promotion for free EZ. We ran that program for 3 years, so we were able to track, at a client level, our experience with them. And we modeled out their propensity to take additional products, and ages, and how long we think they'll be in the system, retention rates, et cetera, et cetera. Some people -- we had spillover, they thought they were free EZ, they weren't. So we model all that out and we calculate the lifetime values, and we just found that the program was useful for a point in time, but it is really declining pretty quickly. I think we provided broader kind of thoughts on that. Specifically, related to -- these were people coming in the first peak when the stores are quite busy. And we just felt, for a lot of reasons, this is the right decision. I think it was very much the right decision. Now you compare that to what Jason does within the digital channel, it's just a different business model. Because the variable cost involved there are negligible, there's no service issues because they're doing it themselves. And that's something that Jason would talk at length about A/B testing, and we've just learned a lot over the years as our competitors have, that these are offers that are compelling for people and it's something that's an important part of how we build our presence in the DIY space.\n\n---\n\nI see. And I think related to that, I suppose, can you talk about what your assisted and online retention rates were last year? How they changed or increased from the previous year?\n\n---\n\nYou want to talk about the DIY?\n\n---\n\nAbout DIY.\n\n---\n\nSure. So DIY was relatively flat. Overall, it's about 64%, software is substantially higher and online is a little bit lower.\n\n---\n\nYes, when it comes to retail, there was a slight decline driven almost entirely by free EZ, the free EZ discontinuation. But as I said, with our customer sat scores and our MDS, which is frankly 2 of the biggest measures we're looking at right now, and all the operating metrics Greg talked about earlier, with walkouts down and wait times reduced, I'm very pleased with how we -- our client service overall, I think, was outstanding.\n\n---\n\nWe're very satisfied with our retention rate this season.\n\n---\n\nAnd when you look forward, do you see that there's profitable growth online for dog-eat-dog at this point at the -- both that you've received from paper and pencil that disappeared?\n\n---\n\nYes. I mean, I think -- and Jason, if you want to comment, I think we pride ourselves on a simple principle, which is we want to serve clients the way they want to be served. And as we've talked about a lot, there are people who -- about 60% of the world wants to have assistance and about 40% of the world wants to do it themselves. And it's kind of the name synonymous with tax preparation, we want to be there to provide those services however we want. So we are very pleased with our digital business. Jason and his team have done a remarkable job. As you've said, we have double-digit revenue increases. We have enhanced user experience metrics. I think the redesign is -- which is only going to get better, is terrific. And our core business, our main business is the assisted retail business, we're very proud of that, and we understand it well. And we'll continue to operate both businesses because its -- our focus is on the client.\n\n---\n\nI think the only additional color I would add -- I mean, this is obviously a category that is the fastest-growing category within tax prep. And the digital category grew about 6%, we grew revenue a lot more than that. But what we see shifting, actually, within digital is really the growth of mobile, and that was the primary reason why we stepped at the redesign and looked at trying to make our product something that is completely flexible upon different form factors, from a tablet to a smartphone, et cetera. And this year, we saw the mobile access to our online product increase about 165%, which says we're well ahead of this curve, even after big gains last year. And so we feel like we're well positioned as we look ahead to finish the redesign, and really look to have nice gains and retention as we go into next year.\n\n---\n\nIs there a significant, since you bring it up, revenue per return on the mobile versus the, I guess, desktop?\n\n---\n\nWe don't break out the revenue between the -- actually, for digital at all, but certainly, not between desktop and online users. But one thing I would say is that, when I talk about mobile, it's really hard to differentiate between a mobile user and an online user because, really, we see even a -- what I would call a prototypical online client, or one that acts in a browser, also using a mobile device in some aspect of the tax preparation experience. So we're seeing this blending of kind of an omni-channel experience, and that's why we redesigned our product and that's why we feel like we're well positioned going forward.\n\n---\n\nI guess what I was asking, and I guess just to make sure, is that the thought that the mobile user was typically a simple return and, therefore, a lower price return.\n\n---\n\nI wouldn't say that, Michael.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. That will conclude today's call. Thank you.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Gil Luria (Analysts)】\nYou made -- you gave us a lot of great commentary about the market this year and what helped you drive the revenue increases. As you look to next year, you already gave us a hint that you think that as long as EIC is not handled at the digital level, there should be still some shift in volumes there. But in terms of the pricing actions that you took this year, is that -- did you come away from the season feeling that you've now exercised that muscle, or do you feel that you could go into next year and make some more moves like that and refine your pricing in some other places to get the similar kind of benefit?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nSo Gil, here's what I would say. First of all, I'm not going to talk about next year. We're still digesting this year, running our overall analytics, and next year will be next year. But we continue to work vigorously on the EIC issue and trying to get parity between the documentation requirements, between assisted and DIY. So again, I wouldn't say that we have much of a comment on any of those points except to say that we have a lot of months between now and the next tax season, and we'll certainly have updates for you as we get toward Investor Day in December.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gil Luria (Analysts)】\nFair enough. And then the excess capital of $850 million to $1 billion, does that include the ability to add leverage or is that just the calculation you went through of where you would be after a bank sale without taking on additional debt?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nThe $850 million to $1 billion number that we talked about earlier is just excess capital and it is independent of any potential additional leverage that we may want to get into.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thomas Allen (Analysts)】\nSome housekeeping things. How many racks [ph] did you do this year? And then how -- why was Peace of Mind revenue up so much? And then, can you just talk a little bit about Emerald Advance, revenue was down, but that was down [indiscernible]. Can -- just what do you do in terms of strategy there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nYes, I'll let Greg run through the numbers, but we had a very considered strategy around -- as we talked about in December, around what we call Tax Plus. It was stamped on the head of every field leader, every office leader. Jason and his team in digital did a terrific job on that. And so Tax Plus really became a real operating approach for us throughout the company, so that's why you see the numbers that we talked about that contributed to Peace of Mind. With regard to Emerald Advance, I think we just managed the overall process well in terms of our underwriting, our collections, et cetera. So we're pleased with the effort there and we think we had a very controlled approach and had a successful season. Greg, is there something -- anything you want to add?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nYes, so the question you asked, Thomas, we did $5.5 million refund transfers this past season, and then I agree very much with what Bill said. The Peace of Mind is a great product. It's a product that has not received a lot of attention here at Block for many years. And under our Tax Plus strategy, we did pay some attention to it and you got to see the kind of results that would happen from that, which I think is really good news.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thomas Allen (Analysts)】\nAnd then on the marketing front, you guys obviously had a very poignant marketing campaign this year. I know its interesting to see that you spent less this year than you did last year. Do you think this is sustainable or were there kind of one-time things going on there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nYes, I mean, obviously, when you have the kind of campaign we have, the awareness we generated in a very short amount of time and the consideration that everyone recognizes this was H&R Block, and you get a lot of bang for your buck there. Again, not going to comment on marketing strategy going forward or level of spending, but I think we're pleased with the way the campaign was received, the way we bought our media, we bought it very efficiently and so overall, I think it was a win all around.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thomas Allen (Analysts)】\nOkay, I'm going to try to squeeze 2 more quick ones in here. Just on the bank sale, once you do sell the banks, how do you plan to telegraph your capital return plan? Do you expect this to kind of start executing on buybacks? I know you have $858 million on your authorization or do you think you'll lay out a plan? And then second question is you announced in April a strategic alliance with Xero. Can you just kind of give us some more color around that, I don't think you guys have really talked about it.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nI'm not sure we're going to use a telegraph, Thomas, but I will let Greg take those 2 questions.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nYes, so I'll start with the bank first. I mean, there's not real much new news here. I mean, I think it was good that the public commentary came and went. Really, everything sits with the regulator right now, and the regulators, plural I should say, and they have a process they follow on this good communication, going back and forth between them and us and B of I. But as I said in the prepared comments, we are -- continue to believe that the best estimate is to this in place for next tax season. Ideally, we'd like to get it done as soon as possible, but there is a process and timeline that's going to have to work out here. There's always risk, though, when you're working with regulators. Their timelines are different. Their decisions may not be what we want, but we still -- that's what we've -- kind of our best estimate is. As things develop -- at the point which material things come up, we would share those with you as we have, that's our normal practice. On the Xero comment, or the Xero question, so Xero, if those of you on the phone are not familiar with Xero, it's X-E-R-O. You can go to their website at xero.com. It's a great company and we have -- Block have been in the business services, small business accounting business for a long time. And it's not an area that's received a lot of attention, it's not really that big. And we have been thinking about what is kind of the next way to reinvigorate that and we began thinking about the software and the service offering that we provide to our clients. And we found Xero and they really have developed what they would describe as beautiful software, and it would be a software that we would use as part of our value proposition to our clients and new clients. So it's a new venture. I would say that we're hopeful, but it's going to take time to build into that, so I wouldn't get too excited by it in the short term.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thomas Allen (Analysts)】\nOkay. And so just to elaborate on the first question, once you -- the bank sale is done, how are you going to communicate to the street kind of your capital return plan?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nYes, so we haven't -- I mean, these are questions that are always contingent upon getting the approval from the regulators, so Job 1 is to get approval at a regulator. We're not sitting idly here at Block for that to happen, but these are things that have to go between our Board of Directors, and then we have to think about it. But my kind of answer, ultimately, is going to be at the appropriate time, we'll share those decisions and timelines with you.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kartik Mehta (Analysts)】\nGreg, I think in your prepared remarks, you said a price increase of 3%. And I'm wondering, is that 3% excluding the 1040EZ, or is that 3% include the 1040EZ pricing change you've had this year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nIt's excluding, Kartik.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kartik Mehta (Analysts)】\nSo excluding the 1040EZ, all other forms you had a 3% price increase, and that does not include anything you would do on the racks side or any of the other Tax Plus products, correct?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nYes. The 3% that we communicated would be really -- think of it as a base form increase. Nothing to do with the products, the additional taxes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nAnd I think, Kartik, just for a little bit more context on that. I think what we're -- what Greg was trying to do in his script was really give you context for some of the operating decisions we took around free 1040. We didn't raise prices 12% or in that neighborhood, or 10%. We wanted to give you some color around the dimension of that, so that's why. But if you just wanted to, \"Look at what might be called general pricing,\" that's what the 3% refers to.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kartik Mehta (Analysts)】\nAnd Bill, what will your digital strategy next year be if Intuit goes along with their half price date, like they did this year, I know you tested that a little bit. Would your strategy change at all, is your thought that you're going to continue on the same path as you did this year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nSo, Jason, why don't we reveal our strategy for 2015 on digital? Kartik, you know we're not going to do that. But why don't I let Jason kind of give his perspective, which is, I think, always helpful. We're not going to get into next year, but I want him to talk a little bit about how we're viewing things.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jason Houseworth (Executives)】\nThanks for your question, Kartik, this is Jason. So I'll remind you just how we started this season, which was in year 1 of a 2-year redesign, which was a ground-up redesign focused on creating a mobile first and personalized product experience. And within this, our focus was to figure out how can we continue to improve conversion, improve retention and monetization on our average revenue per user through an enhanced value perception and customization that the redesign creates. So for this tax season, we really had a plan to begin to realize part of the benefits of this redesign and we executed this plan. We continue to improve our conversion and, more importantly, as Bill noted, we saw substantial improvement in online monetization, and that was specifically from gains in free to basic or free to paid upgrades, delivering double-digit revenue growth for the digital business. As far as pricing, we're always testing in order to figure out the right way to monetize and the right way to create an experience that's going to improve our overall product. And we continue to do that and that will be factored into our product strategy, as it always does.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kartik Mehta (Analysts)】\nSo, Bill, maybe, a question you might be able to give more -- a bigger answer to -- a better answer to would be the Phoenix project. I know you tested some stores in Phoenix with GoHealth. I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about how those went and maybe what you learned, and if you'll be able to be expand on that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nYes, and I'll let Jason weigh in. Mark Ciaramitaro, who many of you met at Investor Day, runs our health care business, reports into Jason, so Jason is very intimately involved with the health care business also. So that's our enrollment service. We ran 3 pilots last year, Phoenix was one of them, kind of the in-store piece. Again, not ready to comment on how we go forward, but suffice to say that I think we learned a lot. We certainly enrolled thousands of people. And I think our service, our user experience, we got high marks from -- in terms of this being a guided experience versus just going through the exchange. There's a lot of things we're still unfolding in realtime, so it was a little bit of a lumpy season really based on more external than ourselves. But we're very pleased with how our teams executed against it. I don't know if there's anything you want to add to that, Jason.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jason Houseworth (Executives)】\nI think that what I would add is, Bill talked about trying to figure out how do we add valuable service to our clients. But specifically, we were trying to figure out what's the model that best fits into our overall business. And we looked at a -- we were really testing a number of factors, like relevancy, various operational aspects and even our marketing approach, and we feel like that we gained insights that we can really apply to our offerings in this tax season, and we'll discuss this in more detail in December on our Investor Day.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Hamzah Mazari (Analysts)】\nBill, you touched on pricing on the 3% figure. Could you give us some color as to -- is that a normalized pricing number we should think about on a go-forward basis? I know you mentioned you're going to be strategic about pricing. Just curious how we should think about that number on a go-forward basis. And is the portfolio pruning over or do you have more pruning to do as you look forward?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nSo let me take that, Greg, and if you want to add anything. So in terms of -- I think we've indicated on -- Greg does a great job with our investment thesis. That, generally, we believe pricing actions in the 2% to 3% range would be consistent with what investors could expect. So I think we're within that -- we're on the higher end of the range. This past year, we've been on the lower end. I still think that, Greg, I think you agree that will probably hold as a go-forward, and obviously we'll talk about that more. But I think that's consistent with what we've said going forward. As far as additional pruning, I assume you're talking from a corporate perspective. We are very committed -- obviously, we have the bank deal, which we talked about and you're all very familiar with. But, no, I think we have the company we want to have, we have the strategy we want to have with Tax Plus, so this is our go forward. We've got all of our field leaders in this week, we've been meeting with them. We are, again, way ahead of where we were last year in terms of planning. So Tax Plus, as I said earlier, stamped in everyone's forehead and that's how we're going forward.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nLet me just comment on the -- there was a pruning question that I wanted to kind of just focus a couple of comments on. So, Bill, said the main point, which is we, in our industry, enjoy low price elasticity that's not changing. We know a lot about that. What we're trying to do is evolve pricing from, I think, what has been historically at Block and at least in the last several years, as a tactical weapon and make it more of a strategic opportunity for us. And so the things that we changed this year were more about getting a system aligned to what we're trying to do more at the macro level. And so those were the outputs, which in this case were very positive in terms of revenue, were good outcomes from that. But that wasn't the goal, necessarily, of the things -- the changes that we made. So we're going to continue to think strategically about pricing, knowing fundamentally that there's price elasticity in this business, but also, fundamentally, that we're going to be here another 60 years and we have to think about the client, what's the right thing for the client over their lifetime.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Hamzah Mazari (Analysts)】\nRight. And, Greg, just a question on your investment grade comment. Do you know that there's value in the investment grade? Could you maybe walk us through the rationale of how there is value for your business within investment grade? And you also said, \"We're not going to sit idle for the bank sale to close. We're going to continue to work.\" Any conversations you've had with the rating agencies and maybe talk about how they're going to look at your business differently? The investment grade, it can mean a lot of different things in different businesses, so any color around those comments would be very helpful.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nYes, okay. So we do talk to the rating agencies on a regular basis. We've got good relationships established with Standard & Poor's and Moody's. As you can expect and appreciate, getting our 2014 financial results finalized is an important part of the discussion, as we shape what's likely to be a busy 12 months ahead of us if our timelines hold up as it relates to the regulatory process and so on. But that's really the extent of the conversations. Because, really -- and so we're kind of past the rates or the approval process and getting the closing process finalized. It would be premature for us, I think, to get too specific with the rating agencies. In terms of the justification behind investment grade. What we said before, I'm just going to say again, is we at Block, over the last several years in conjunction with the board and a lot of external health, have looked at all the considerations that most companies would look at. And then the unique aspects of Block around our seasonality and our history, and the conclusion was that investment grade is the right place for us. But we haven't really gone much further than saying exactly what that means at this point in time. But as things develop, we'll update you at the appropriate time.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nHamzah, let me add a little more perspective on this, and this is more, if you will, from my chair. Because I think there's a lot of talk around investment grade and I want to make sure everyone understands what we're saying. We have been very clear that upon the completion of the bank process, we are looking at returning capital to shareholders as we had done -- I'm only going to talk about the time that I've been here, that we had done previously, when we raised the dividend 33% and bought back 12% of the shares. So we want to have a return of capital. We indicated today that our excess capital expectations are approaching $1 billion. And as Greg mentioned earlier, we will take on incremental net debt beyond where we are today as part of that return process. What I've tried to do is be very deliberate, thoughtful, et cetera. And investment grade is obviously a decision any company faces, our liquidity needs are real. So I think shareholders are going to be very pleased, as we go through this process, that the combination of incremental net debt plus the excess capital return will be very shareholder-friendly or whatever term you want to use. And that, I think, that we can balance everything and I think it's very consistent with the approach I've tried to take to the company. And obviously, we're going to be -- as Greg indicated earlier, we're planning on being here for 60 years or so. So we're going to manage this company with both an eye toward an event like that, but also with an eye toward the long term.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Hamzah Mazari (Analysts)】\nThat's very helpful, I appreciate that color. Just one last question, I'll turn it over. The pushout of the tax season in Canada, or the extension, any idea how much revenue that is pushed out? I know Canada is not massive for you, but any quantification of that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nI'm glad you asked that because it was actually an interesting little wrinkle to this year. But with the Heartbleed security, we can set -- everyone's probably familiar with the Canadian taxing authority. The CRA essentially said we're going to shut down and set the e-files would -- turned out to be 5 whole days. And the message that was delivered to the taxpayer in Canada was really received as we're kind of -- there's no need to file your taxes until we tell you to. And as a result of that decision, the CRA, the Canadian Revenue Authority, extended the tax season for all intents and purposes an extra 5 days. So it went from April 30 normally to May 5, so we were actually calling it April 35 this year. And so that resulted in us having to keep our stores open longer, 5 extra days, staffing them. We actually spent additional marketing money behind that. There were a lot of operational things that, frankly, the Canadian team really did a great job with. But in terms of specifically quantifying that, we're not going to get that level of detail with you, it's just -- it's not material. We don't disclose that level of detail.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Schneeberger (Analysts)】\nA few questions. Bill, I'd like to start off, this is a reask of something we've heard already. But just your level of conviction on growing revenue going forward, was that a 1-year strategy? You touched on what you think is an appropriate rate increase as we go forward. I think everyone is just kind of wondering, might we see something where you go back and grab market share? So just trying to gauge the conviction on the multi-year strategy around that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nYes, I mean, you know the answer I'll give you, we're not going to get into the specifics. But let me just try to answer your question specifically or from a strategic point of view. We, ultimately, want to grow our revenue and that does include -- there are various ways you can grow revenue and it's price and mix and unit volume, et cetera, and we will look at all of those levers as we look to go forward. But the emphasis on -- that we indicated this year that I talked about with our field leaders this year, continues to be Tax Plus revenue growth. So that will be the focus as we go forward, and that is the emphasis. We think we have best-in-class financial services products, so attaching those products to our clients, servicing them, providing that value is an important part of our story. So I don't know if that specifically answers your question, but, yes, we will be very focused on that, again, as we go forward.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Schneeberger (Analysts)】\nAnd one of you mentioned earlier in the presentation that the folks that were 1040EZ that you changed pricing on this year are not really a core ACA target, and I was just hoping you could elaborate a little bit on that. And then, the second part of the question would be, any discussion on what you're seeing in form creation for ACA that could -- any early insights into next year? So it's 2-parter.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nSo let me take the first part, and then, Jason, do you want to talk about the form -- the situation of forms? I think, again, we're learning about this. We still don't have a lot of data other than the 8 million enrollee number. We don't know how many people are staying in, paying, et cetera. So there's still a lot that needs to happen there, specifically the 1040EZ, a number of very low-income people actually would not be subsidy eligible because they're Medicaid eligible, and that puts them into, in effect, a different category. So while you would think right away everybody would be subsidy eligible, it gets a little tricky, especially when it comes to the Medicaid aspect, and then there are different states who handle Medicaid in different ways. So that's why it's not a simple 1040EZ equals Affordable Care Act enrollees. It's actually -- it gets cut down pretty significantly from that. So again, the whole health care discussion, you've heard us say this numerous times, I think we are well positioned, I think we understand this better than anybody, but this opportunity is going to unfold over the next several years. Now specific to the forms, Jason, do you want to talk about broadly what's going on there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jason Houseworth (Executives)】\nSure. Thanks for your question, Scott. So the IRS hasn't released the final forms or instructions related to ACA, but we do hope to get these details later this summer. What the IRS has shared with us and the industry is that, first, there will be a new reconciliation form, Form 8962, in order to reconcile the advance tax credit. And we also know that there will be a 1095 series of notices to taxpayers, with the 1095A from the health care marketplace, which is required to do a reconciliation, and then the 1095-B and C, which are voluntary for employers and insurance companies. Which means that clients who may not receive a 1095-B or C will actually have to settle for tests for insurance coverage for their household. And then, finally, there will likely be a combined penalty and exemption worksheet. We think this will be the 8965. It will be required to be e-filed with the return for people that have to calculate their penalty or qualify for an exemption. And we know many of the exception reasons today, but there will likely be more in the final instructions when the IRS provides the final version of this worksheet.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Schneeberger (Analysts)】\nA few more if I may. On -- you guys outperformed your EBITDA margin versus last year. Your goal was to come in at about the same, so congratulations on that. Just curious, your long-term 32% is the high-end of the range and you're obviously trending well. Greg, an update, if any, on how you're feeling about that long term, and what shape or form would it come? Would it become a -- coming on expense management or more leveraging the top line?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nSo we're likely to talk about this, obviously, in December. It's has been kind of more of what we've been doing in the last few years. But I think, just a broad thought I would share with you is, our objective is not to maximize margin percentage, but it's to maximize, obviously, revenue growth and then net income dollars at the end of it at acceptable levels of margin percentage. And so, we'll continue to think about that. But as, also, I shared -- we shared with you, and as can see in our numbers, we decided to increase the investment this year into the business. We did that last year, too. Those were actually higher than we originally thought, which is actually a good thing. Because the investments we're making, I think, are smart for the medium and long term, but that's going to have a natural pressure going into next year. We're going to have the bank transaction ideally done, that's going to have impact on margins next year. So we have to digest that plus other things. But in terms of a range, at this point we've guided historically to 27% to 32%. We were 30% last year, we were above that this year, and that's a good thing. But we've not -- we're not, at this point, prepared to change that range.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Schneeberger (Analysts)】\nAnd then 2 more I'll -- they're separate questions, but just to sneak them in. One, I'd love to hear about the Sand Canyon accrual increase and how you're going on tolling agreements, that's sounds like an interesting update. And then the last one, hopefully you'll touch on a little bit. But the comments on incremental net debt going forward, would love to hear initial thoughts on shape or form of that net debt.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nI'll give those both over to Greg.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nSo, Sand Canyon continues to be in discussions with the majority of its counterparties that have made rep and warranty claims. They operate those specifically with tolling arrangements, which are -- is really just an agreement to say let's put the clock, the stature of limitations on hold while we have productive conversations. And those conversations continue to develop, and that's why the tolling arrangements continue to be in place. And so I've always viewed that as a good thing. The fact that the reserve was adjusted upwards, I don't believe it was a huge number, is an indication that there's progress being made in my view, so I saw it as a good step forward. Because I think -- well, at least I can speak for management, the objective here is to help -- to really allow Sand Canyon to wind down at the fairest and orderly way, and that's probably going to -- will still take years at this point. But the fact they're able to see -- make forward progress is a good thing. The second question's really on the incremental net debt. At this point, we're not going to talk very specifically about that. We've indicated that we're prepared to take incremental net debt. It will be involved at the point at which the bank transactions closed. And then at the point which we have more information, we'll share that with you.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Millman (Analysts)】\nMaybe you can discuss some of the differences in terms of monetization or lack of monetization between the EZs and the free online and semi-free online products that the industry has been using.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nYes, so the EZ clan piece -- we're talking very specifically, Mike, about the people that come to our stores that were under the promotion for free EZ. We ran that program for 3 years, so we were able to track, at a client level, our experience with them. And we modeled out their propensity to take additional products, and ages, and how long we think they'll be in the system, retention rates, et cetera, et cetera. Some people -- we had spillover, they thought they were free EZ, they weren't. So we model all that out and we calculate the lifetime values, and we just found that the program was useful for a point in time, but it is really declining pretty quickly. I think we provided broader kind of thoughts on that. Specifically, related to -- these were people coming in the first peak when the stores are quite busy. And we just felt, for a lot of reasons, this is the right decision. I think it was very much the right decision. Now you compare that to what Jason does within the digital channel, it's just a different business model. Because the variable cost involved there are negligible, there's no service issues because they're doing it themselves. And that's something that Jason would talk at length about A/B testing, and we've just learned a lot over the years as our competitors have, that these are offers that are compelling for people and it's something that's an important part of how we build our presence in the DIY space.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Millman (Analysts)】\nI see. And I think related to that, I suppose, can you talk about what your assisted and online retention rates were last year? How they changed or increased from the previous year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jason Houseworth (Executives)】\nYou want to talk about the DIY?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nAbout DIY.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jason Houseworth (Executives)】\nSure. So DIY was relatively flat. Overall, it's about 64%, software is substantially higher and online is a little bit lower.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nYes, when it comes to retail, there was a slight decline driven almost entirely by free EZ, the free EZ discontinuation. But as I said, with our customer sat scores and our MDS, which is frankly 2 of the biggest measures we're looking at right now, and all the operating metrics Greg talked about earlier, with walkouts down and wait times reduced, I'm very pleased with how we -- our client service overall, I think, was outstanding.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nWe're very satisfied with our retention rate this season.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Millman (Analysts)】\nAnd when you look forward, do you see that there's profitable growth online for dog-eat-dog at this point at the -- both that you've received from paper and pencil that disappeared?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nYes. I mean, I think -- and Jason, if you want to comment, I think we pride ourselves on a simple principle, which is we want to serve clients the way they want to be served. And as we've talked about a lot, there are people who -- about 60% of the world wants to have assistance and about 40% of the world wants to do it themselves. And it's kind of the name synonymous with tax preparation, we want to be there to provide those services however we want. So we are very pleased with our digital business. Jason and his team have done a remarkable job. As you've said, we have double-digit revenue increases. We have enhanced user experience metrics. I think the redesign is -- which is only going to get better, is terrific. And our core business, our main business is the assisted retail business, we're very proud of that, and we understand it well. And we'll continue to operate both businesses because its -- our focus is on the client.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jason Houseworth (Executives)】\nI think the only additional color I would add -- I mean, this is obviously a category that is the fastest-growing category within tax prep. And the digital category grew about 6%, we grew revenue a lot more than that. But what we see shifting, actually, within digital is really the growth of mobile, and that was the primary reason why we stepped at the redesign and looked at trying to make our product something that is completely flexible upon different form factors, from a tablet to a smartphone, et cetera. And this year, we saw the mobile access to our online product increase about 165%, which says we're well ahead of this curve, even after big gains last year. And so we feel like we're well positioned as we look ahead to finish the redesign, and really look to have nice gains and retention as we go into next year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Millman (Analysts)】\nIs there a significant, since you bring it up, revenue per return on the mobile versus the, I guess, desktop?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jason Houseworth (Executives)】\nWe don't break out the revenue between the -- actually, for digital at all, but certainly, not between desktop and online users. But one thing I would say is that, when I talk about mobile, it's really hard to differentiate between a mobile user and an online user because, really, we see even a -- what I would call a prototypical online client, or one that acts in a browser, also using a mobile device in some aspect of the tax preparation experience. So we're seeing this blending of kind of an omni-channel experience, and that's why we redesigned our product and that's why we feel like we're well positioned going forward.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Millman (Analysts)】\nI guess what I was asking, and I guess just to make sure, is that the thought that the mobile user was typically a simple return and, therefore, a lower price return.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jason Houseworth (Executives)】\nI wouldn't say that, Michael.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Colby Brown (Executives)】\nOkay. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. That will conclude today's call. Thank you.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you, Laurie, and good morning, everyone. I want to thank you for joining us today for Brown-Forman's fourth quarter 2014 earnings call. Joining me today are Paul Varga, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Jane Morreau, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Fitzgerald, Chief Accounting Officer.\r\nThis morning's conference call contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Numerous risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or projected in these statements. Many of the factors that will determine future results are beyond the company's ability to control or predict. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, and the company undertakes no obligation to update any of these statements, whether due to new information, future events or otherwise. \r\nThis morning, we issued a press release containing our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. The release can be found on our website under the section titled Investor Relations. In the press release, we have listed a number of the risk factors that you should consider in conjunction with our forward-looking statements. Other significant risk factors are described in our Form 10-K, Form 8-K and Form 10-Q reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\r\nDuring this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures and the reason management believes they provide useful information to investors regarding the company's financial conditions and results of operations are contained in the press release. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jane for her prepared remarks.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Jay. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today for our fiscal 2014 year end earnings call. I plan on covering 3 topics today, and then I'm going to turn the call over to Paul. First, I'm going to review our excellent 2014 results. And then, I'm going to briefly discuss our fourth quarter results and recent global trends we see entering 2015. And finally, I'm going to share our outlook for fiscal 2015.\r\nSo let me start with the review of our 2014 results. Simply put, we had a terrific year thanks to the balanced geographic delivery of growth from our leading portfolio of American whiskey brands, not to mention high-quality investments behind both our brands and our people. \r\nOur underlying net sales grew over 6% in 2014. While this top line growth was slightly below the 7% we had targeted for the full year, we estimate that we outperformed our global competitive set by roughly 5 points, as their rates of growth slowed considerably during the year. We believe that our results have been less impacted due to the balanced approach to investment in both emerging and developed markets, as well as our disciplined management of risk. This approach has helped us draw out growth in both developed markets such as Western Europe while being -- while avoiding being overly dependent on some of the emerging markets that experienced meaningful slowdowns this year, such as China. \r\nSo let me list -- run through some of our geographic results. When we look at our emerging markets business, it performed quite well. In fact, we delivered 9% underlying net sales growth. Notably, we enjoyed sales growth of greater than 20% in markets such as Brazil, the former CIS countries, China, Turkey, emerging Africa, Southeast Asia and Russia.\r\nBut our results in emerging markets were not completely immune from the slowdown. In fact, in Mexico, our underlying sales declined 4%, driven in part by the first quarter giveback that resulted from inventory buy-ins at the end of fiscal 2013. In addition, an extremely competitive environment for tequilas also contributed to the decline. \r\nExcluding Mexico's disappointing results, we delivered 7% underlying net sales growth in 2014. In Poland, we delivered 2% underlying net sales growth. We executed 2 price increases on Finlandia in the year, including one on top of a 15% excise tax hike. And we were able to deliver 4% growth in underlying net sales for the brand.\r\nWhile we believe these are great results for such a mature category, we're closely watching the consumer response to this massive excise tax increase, as we believe this could adversely impact the demand for vodka. And in fact, we are already seeing some signs of softer trends in that market.\r\nLet me move on to Brown-Forman's developed markets outside the U.S., where we delivered 6% underlying net sales growth. The United Kingdom and Germany both grew underlying net sales 8%, and France grew an impressive 18%. The incremental costs for our recent routes and market changes in France will show up predominantly in SG&A going forward. We expect that the benefit from higher sales and gross profit, as we no longer compensate a third party to distribute our products in France, will more than pay for the establishment of our infrastructure in this market in its first full year of operation. France's reported sales fell 12%, reflecting the decrease in shipments and corresponding inventory levels that occurred in the third quarter as we made this transition. \r\nAustralia grew underlying sales by 2% despite a weaker economy. We believe that the spirits market in that country has been negatively impacted by the disproportionately high excise taxes on spirits relative to other alcoholic beverages. Canada, our 10th largest market by reported net sales, grew underlying sales 4% and reported sales 2%. Japan grew underlying net sales by 13%, but reported net sales declined 11% as we lapped the large inventory buy-ins associated with the distribution change to Asahi at the beginning of 2013.\r\nTurning to our U.S. business. Our underlying net sales grew over 4%, almost entirely driven by price increases and better portfolio mix. American whiskey continues to gain value share versus TDS after decades of decline, and we believe that the stable dynamics driving this growth remain intact, including consumer interest in authentic brands with heritage, not to mention the early stages of flavor innovation in this country. Off-premise trends remain healthy, but on-premise trends there are still declining.\r\nWith that, let me now move the discussion to our brands, where Jack Daniel's led the way. The Jack Daniel's family registered 8% underlying net sales growth, with net sales growth of 10% in markets outside the U.S. and 6% in the U.S. Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey was the backbone of the family's global growth this year, and Tennessee Honey was once again an integral contributor, growing underlying net sales by 36% despite comparisons to the prior year, when the brand's net sales doubled.\r\nTennessee Honey has officially joined the rarefied air that Jack Daniel's enjoys as 1 of 20 brands over 1 million cases priced at $25 -- over $25 per 750. We are extremely proud of the brand's success, driven in no small part through our thoughtful and disciplined approach to innovation, and we fully intend on taking the lessons learned and applying them to future products.\r\nJack Daniel's Single Barrel and Gentleman Jack together grew underlying net sales 12% and depleted over 600,000 cases. Growth of 11% in the U.S. was almost as strong as the 13% growth registered outside the U.S. Jack Daniel's RTDs and RTPs also performed well, up 5%.\r\nWe continue to innovate beyond Tennessee Honey, including Winter Jack's rollout to the U.S., which helped drive depletions of over 110,000 cases. Sinatra Select depleted over 10,000 cases globally, and we launched No. 27 Gold, a twice-mellowed, twice-barreled expression, which appears to be off to a really good start. \r\nIn the fourth quarter, we also announced that we have begun testing Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire, a new flavored spirit that tastefully blends the Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey with a red-hot cinnamon flavor. This test is only in its second month in 3 states, but we've been encouraged by what we've been hearing, including positive qualitative feedback from our salespeople, distributors and in social media. The phenomenon of flavored whiskeys in the U.S. appears to be in its infancy, but it is already driving some of the most explosive growth that we've seen in the spirits industry in years. So we will evaluate a number of key metrics around the consumer and trade's receptivity to the brand, and we will keep you informed on the progress of this test on future calls. But with a brand as important as Jack Daniel's, you can expect us to be prudent with our approach, yet another example of how we manage the balance of risk and reward.\r\nWoodford Reserve's family of brands grew underlying net sales by 26%, marking the 18th consecutive year of double-digit gains for the family, and we believe we were just cracking the surface of the brand's global potential. Old Forester grew underlying net sales 16% in the year, with accelerating growth in the on-premise as word spreads among bourbon connoisseurs. It's refreshing to see consumers return to authenticity, as Old Forester was not just our founding brand, launched in 1870, but also was the first bottled bourbon. And during the bourbon boom of the 1960s, Old Forester sold over 1 million cases per year. \r\nHerradura and el Jimador grew underlying sales in the U.S. by 12% and 9%, respectively, but global sales suffered from the extremely challenging conditions in Mexico, where our Family of Brands experienced a decline of 8% in underlying net sales.\r\nFiscal 2014 was not a good year for New Mix, though our sales did stabilize somewhat during the year after the first quarter's large giveback. Southern Comfort's underlying net sales fell 2% in the year. Results outside the U.S. grew 2%, driven by a rebound in the United Kingdom. Results in the U.S. were disappointing, with underlying sales down 6%. We believe these declines are due to the persistent challenges in the liqueurs category, as well as declines in the on-premise. \r\nMoving now to the P&L and record selling reported to underlying net sales. Reported net sales growth of 4% was negatively impacted by 1 point due to reductions in trade inventories and by another point due largely to the weakening of the Aussie dollar, resulting in 6% underlying net sales growth for the year. \r\nIn addition to the global -- increased global demand for our brands I just discussed, we also benefited from higher prices and better mix, as innovation contributed roughly 2 points to the company's underlying net sales growth for the year. This helped us drive a 100 basis points improvement in gross margin and an 8% underlying growth in gross profit.\r\nUnderlying A&P increased 8%, as we continued to invest behind the long-term development and positioning of our brands. A&P is now up 25% over the last 3 years, as we anticipate another year of healthy growth in fiscal 2015.\r\nUnderlying SG&A grew 6% in fiscal 2014. And it's important to note that we have been making very purposeful planned strategic investments behind our business that we believe will drive continued outperformance. Some of the examples include investments in emerging market capabilities, as well as investments to drive the global growth of the Jack Daniel's family of brands. But we are also investing in other capabilities such as the recent route-to-market change in France, the world's third largest whiskey market. And we expect to have many opportunities to make similar high-return investments around the world as we reach critical mass in rapidly growing markets, emerging and developed.\r\nOverlying each of these investments is our belief that investing in our people creates a competitive advantage in the marketplace through higher engagement, better loyalty and greater diversity of experiences, leading to what we believe are improved decision-making, innovation and collaboration, which ultimately drives better profit growth. Nowhere is this more evident than in our route-to-consumer investments we've made over the past few years. \r\nPutting it all together, strong top line growth coupled with increases in our operating expenses led to underlying operating income growth of 11% in fiscal 2011, which we estimate to be 9 -- fiscal 2014, which we estimate to be 9 points ahead of our global competitive set.\r\nAnd over the last 3 years, Brown-Forman has delivered 37% growth in underlying operating income, nearly double what we estimate to be the growth rate for the industry over the same period. Our reported diluted earnings per share for the year came in at around $3.06, helped in part by a lower tax rate but negatively impacted by the $0.06 due to the distribution change in France.\r\nNow I'm going to move on to my second topic and briefly discuss our fourth quarter results and recent global industry and economic trends we see as we enter into 2015.\r\nIn the fourth quarter, our underlying net sales grew 3%. But as we mentioned on our third quarter call, we expected the fourth quarter's rate of growth to be negatively impacted by significant timing issues. This included expected giveback in Poland and Germany after the large buy-ins that incurred in both of these markets during the third quarter. It also included the challenging year-over-year comparison with last year's fourth quarter, when we experienced buy-ins in advance of price increases in Mexico, as well as inventory build in Japan early last year. After adjusting for these items, we estimate our underlying net sales growth in the fourth quarter came in more in line with our full year underlying net sales growth for the year. \r\nLooking at economic and industry trends through a geographic lens, the U.S. continued to experience healthy growth, notwithstanding the slow start to the calendar year. The developed markets outside the U.S. showed signs of improvement, driven largely by better conditions in larger developed markets of Europe.\r\nAnd while some of the emerging markets have slowed, the broader group enjoys the favorable tailwinds of a large and rapidly growing middle class with an enormous appetite for American whiskey. So net-net, we believe that we are entering fiscal 2015 with a favorable backdrop. \r\nSo this leads me to my third and final topic, our outlook for 2015, which we are expecting to be another strong year of growth. So most of the trends that have driven our top line growth over the last 3 years we expect to continue in fiscal 2015. This includes global interest in premium American whiskey, which has helped drive share gains over TDS.\r\nIn fiscal 2015, we expect price increases outside the U.S. to be comparable to what we achieved in fiscal 2014. In the U.S., we are intentionally moderating our price increases following the cumulative effect of 2 years of robust pricing. Putting this all together, this should result in roughly 2 points of price improvements in fiscal 2015.\r\nWith mid-single-digit volume growth expected, we believe we can deliver another strong year of underlying net sales growth in the 6% to 8% range. Looking at gross margins for next year, we expect them to expand at a more modest rate than they did in fiscal 2015, driven by price mix gains that will roughly offset cost inflation, as well as better margins that we expect from France.\r\nIn fiscal 2015, underlying A&P is expected to grow slightly faster than sales growth, and underlying SG&A is projected to grow slightly below sales growth. Remember that SG&A in fiscal 2015 will include the full-year impact of our own distribution in France.\r\nOn the capital investment side, fiscal 2014 CapEx came in lighter than expected, due largely to a shift of some spending into 2015. We now expect 2015's CapEx to be in the $120 million to $140 million range as we complete these once-in-a-generation investments that we believe will allow us to strengthen our competitive advantages through our barrel-making operations and distilling capacity. Just looking at 2016 CapEx for a moment, we believe that will be another year of stepped-up capital investments before CapEx returns toward historic levels of 2% to 3% of net sales.\r\nSo net-net all these strategic investments behind our people, our brands and our production capabilities, we believe we can deliver underlying operating income growth of 9% to 11% and diluted earnings per share of $3.25 to $3.45. This EPS range assumes a full year tax rate of 30% to 31% and includes a negligible impact from foreign exchange. However, sensitivity on foreign exchange, a 10% move in the dollar in either direction, would impact our full year EPS by approximately $0.14 per share. \r\nOne more quick comment on fiscal 2015. We do expect some volatility in the seasonality of both our underlying and reported results, particularly in the first quarter, as we lap significant buy-ins in the U.S. from aggressive price increases over the last 2 years. We expect our performance over the balance of the year to strengthen following tough Q1 comps.\r\nSo in summary, fiscal 2014 was yet another great year for Brown-Forman, as we drove market-leading growth while simultaneously investing in our long-term strategy. Our free cash flow is impressive, driven by an inherent efficiency that results from a single point of production for much of our focused portfolio.\r\nThis cash affords us the ability to invest in the business while driving a strong balance sheet with net debt down $230 million this year. Our balance sheet flexibility, combined with excess cash, allows us to opportunistically look for suitable M&A, as well as explore ways to return this cash to our shareholders over time, as we did this year when we returned $280 million through quarterly dividends and buybacks. Over the last 10 years, we have returned $3.7 billion to shareholders through a combination of growing dividends, share buybacks and special dividends.\r\nOur great results in 2014, not to mention over longer periods of time, are aided by the long-term horizon of our strong, family-controlled shareholder base. And we believe our prospects remain as bright as ever, driven by our premium spirits portfolio, anchored around the fast-growing American whiskey category.\r\nGlobal demand for whiskey, and Jack Daniel's in particular, is strong and growing. And we believe the long-term opportunities for Brown-Forman are enormous. So with that, I'm going to turn over the call to Paul for his comments.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Jane, and good morning to everybody. I'll just add a few comments to what Jane has done here this morning. In general, I thought we had just another great year overall. And I think our relative TSR performance over 4 horizons, 1, 3, 5 and 10 years, provide what I consider to be perhaps the finest summary statement about the quality of our fiscal year 2014, as well as the many successful years that have preceded it. Across all 4 of these time horizons, Brown-Forman's absolute and relative TSRs are impressive, in my view. Our annual total shareholder return over 10 years was 17%, significantly outperforming our industry competitive set, consumer staples and the S&P 500. In fact, Brown-Forman's at the very top of this benchmark set over the 3-, 5- and 10-year horizons, with only Beam outperforming us on the 1-year as a result of their sale to Suntory.\r\nNow Jane highlighted the 2 biggest reasons for our F '14 outperformance relative to the industry. Those were: one, our strong exposure to, and category leadership of, the premium American whiskey segment, which continues to have excellent momentum; and two, our geographically balanced contributions from both developed and emerging markets alike. I believe that in combination, these 2 descriptors help make Brown-Forman unique today in the global spirits business. \r\nLed by our multi-decade work on the amazing Jack Daniel's trademark, Brown-Forman has and continues to play the lead role in expanding the appeal of premium American whiskey to more than 160 countries worldwide. Globally, consumers have come to appreciate Jack Daniel's and American whiskey for an abundance of attributes that I believe include taste, quality, heritage, premiumness and authenticity.\r\nAt the very same time, consumers also enjoy Jack Daniel's' mixability, modern popularity and its accessible, less formal, down-to-earth brand personality. As I've said in the past, I think Jack Daniel's and American whiskey uniquely possess attributes of both scotch and vodka, 2 of the world's largest and most important distilled spirits categories globally. And as you've heard here this morning, our FY '15 investment posture and earnings guidance reflect our belief that this appeal will continue. \r\nAnd my belief in our growth prospects extends well beyond just the next 12 months, as both Jack Daniel's and American whiskey's share of the global whiskey market, despite their wonderful development over the last decade, remain at relatively low levels. Accordingly, our short-, mid- and long-range plans prioritize the continued development of strong trademarks against the global whiskey opportunity, something we know very well with the Jack Daniel's trademark leading the way. And we will pursue the global whiskey opportunity with some superb assets in hand. These include our whiskey trademarks, like Jack Daniel's, Woodford Reserve, Old Forester, Canadian Mist and Early Times; our distilling and manufacturing operations, which are being expanded as we speak, and these include our unique ownership of barrel-making operations that give us unparalleled control over barrels' supply, cost and innovation; and an expanding influence over our global route to consumer. When paired with our company's collective whiskey knowhow, we feel these high-quality assets and capabilities position Brown-Forman very well to continue its growth and success around the world. \r\nAs in the past, I believe our success will require great ideas, like Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey, consistent investment and the focused efforts of our talented employees worldwide. \r\nThis last reference to the focused efforts of our people is another attribute that I believe is somewhat unique to Brown-Forman relative to our competition. As I consider those in the spirits industry today who are working to build their company's global, I don't know of another company who prioritizes the development of a single trademark in their sales and marketing efforts across such a vast global landscape the way we do with Jack Daniel's. And I believe this is a unique advantage for both Jack Daniel's and Brown-Forman. What we may lack in terms of portfolio breadth, scale and size relative to some competition, I believe we more than make up for with intensity and consistency of focus globally. And certainly, the investments we've made over the years in our route to consumer have been one of the key enablers of this. \r\nSo let me summarize why I believe Brown-Forman is a truly unique investment opportunity, and I'll apologize in advance for overusing the word unique here to make my point. We uniquely own Jack Daniel's, the leader of American whiskey and one of the world's largest premium distilled spirits in the world of any kind. This one-of-a-kind brand has the appeal of both scotch and vodka, giving it a vast and somewhat unique global consumer opportunity. We seize that opportunity with a unique set of trademark and manufacturing assets that enable us to efficiently produce 148-year-old brand icons like Jack Daniel's, fast-growing super-premium whiskey brands like Woodford Reserve and successful innovations like Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey. We take these superb brands to the global marketplace with what I believe is a unique and unmatched level of sales and marketing focus. \r\nAnd of course, I'll add to that, that we have the unique commitment and support of the Brown family, who has continuously owned and controlled Brown-Forman for more than 140 years and who remain very committed to the company's enduring and independent success. This combination, in my view, helps produce the uniquely attractive financial results that we share with you today and that we are intent on delivering going forward. \r\nLet me close by simply thanking our employees worldwide for another year of really outstanding results. You are indeed unique to Brown-Forman, as is the culture in which we all work, and none of these results are possible without you. So thank you. This concludes our prepared remarks, and we're now happy to take any questions you might have.",

And during the bourbon boom of the 1960s, Old Forester sold over 1 million cases per year. \r\nHerradura and el Jimador grew underlying sales in the U.S. by 12% and 9%, respectively, but global sales suffered from the extremely challenging conditions in Mexico, where our Family of Brands experienced a decline of 8% in underlying net sales.\r\nFiscal 2014 was not a good year for New Mix, though our sales did stabilize somewhat during the year after the first quarter's large giveback. Southern Comfort's underlying net sales fell 2% in the year. Results outside the U.S. grew 2%, driven by a rebound in the United Kingdom. Results in the U.S. were disappointing, with underlying sales down 6%. We believe these declines are due to the persistent challenges in the liqueurs category, as well as declines in the on-premise. \r\nMoving now to the P&L and record selling reported to underlying net sales. Reported net sales growth of 4% was negatively impacted by 1 point due to reductions in trade inventories and by another point due largely to the weakening of the Aussie dollar, resulting in 6% underlying net sales growth for the year. \r\nIn addition to the global -- increased global demand for our brands I just discussed, we also benefited from higher prices and better mix, as innovation contributed roughly 2 points to the company's underlying net sales growth for the year. This helped us drive a 100 basis points improvement in gross margin and an 8% underlying growth in gross profit.\r\nUnderlying A&P increased 8%, as we continued to invest behind the long-term development and positioning of our brands. A&P is now up 25% over the last 3 years, as we anticipate another year of healthy growth in fiscal 2015.\r\nUnderlying SG&A grew 6% in fiscal 2014. And it's important to note that we have been making very purposeful planned strategic investments behind our business that we believe will drive continued outperformance. Some of the examples include investments in emerging market capabilities, as well as investments to drive the global growth of the Jack Daniel's family of brands. But we are also investing in other capabilities such as the recent route-to-market change in France, the world's third largest whiskey market. And we expect to have many opportunities to make similar high-return investments around the world as we reach critical mass in rapidly growing markets, emerging and developed.\r\nOverlying each of these investments is our belief that investing in our people creates a competitive advantage in the marketplace through higher engagement, better loyalty and greater diversity of experiences, leading to what we believe are improved decision-making, innovation and collaboration, which ultimately drives better profit growth. Nowhere is this more evident than in our route-to-consumer investments we've made over the past few years. \r\nPutting it all together, strong top line growth coupled with increases in our operating expenses led to underlying operating income growth of 11% in fiscal 2011, which we estimate to be 9 -- fiscal 2014, which we estimate to be 9 points ahead of our global competitive set.\r\nAnd over the last 3 years, Brown-Forman has delivered 37% growth in underlying operating income, nearly double what we estimate to be the growth rate for the industry over the same period. Our reported diluted earnings per share for the year came in at around $3.06, helped in part by a lower tax rate but negatively impacted by the $0.06 due to the distribution change in France.\r\nNow I'm going to move on to my second topic and briefly discuss our fourth quarter results and recent global industry and economic trends we see as we enter into 2015.\r\nIn the fourth quarter, our underlying net sales grew 3%. But as we mentioned on our third quarter call, we expected the fourth quarter's rate of growth to be negatively impacted by significant timing issues. This included expected giveback in Poland and Germany after the large buy-ins that incurred in both of these markets during the third quarter. It also included the challenging year-over-year comparison with last year's fourth quarter, when we experienced buy-ins in advance of price increases in Mexico, as well as inventory build in Japan early last year. After adjusting for these items, we estimate our underlying net sales growth in the fourth quarter came in more in line with our full year underlying net sales growth for the year. \r\nLooking at economic and industry trends through a geographic lens, the U.S. continued to experience healthy growth, notwithstanding the slow start to the calendar year. The developed markets outside the U.S. showed signs of improvement, driven largely by better conditions in larger developed markets of Europe.\r\nAnd while some of the emerging markets have slowed, the broader group enjoys the favorable tailwinds of a large and rapidly growing middle class with an enormous appetite for American whiskey. So net-net, we believe that we are entering fiscal 2015 with a favorable backdrop. \r\nSo this leads me to my third and final topic, our outlook for 2015, which we are expecting to be another strong year of growth. So most of the trends that have driven our top line growth over the last 3 years we expect to continue in fiscal 2015. This includes global interest in premium American whiskey, which has helped drive share gains over TDS.\r\nIn fiscal 2015, we expect price increases outside the U.S. to be comparable to what we achieved in fiscal 2014. In the U.S., we are intentionally moderating our price increases following the cumulative effect of 2 years of robust pricing. Putting this all together, this should result in roughly 2 points of price improvements in fiscal 2015.\r\nWith mid-single-digit volume growth expected, we believe we can deliver another strong year of underlying net sales growth in the 6% to 8% range. Looking at gross margins for next year, we expect them to expand at a more modest rate than they did in fiscal 2015, driven by price mix gains that will roughly offset cost inflation, as well as better margins that we expect from France.\r\nIn fiscal 2015, underlying A&P is expected to grow slightly faster than sales growth, and underlying SG&A is projected to grow slightly below sales growth. Remember that SG&A in fiscal 2015 will include the full-year impact of our own distribution in France.\r\nOn the capital investment side, fiscal 2014 CapEx came in lighter than expected, due largely to a shift of some spending into 2015. We now expect 2015's CapEx to be in the $120 million to $140 million range as we complete these once-in-a-generation investments that we believe will allow us to strengthen our competitive advantages through our barrel-making operations and distilling capacity. Just looking at 2016 CapEx for a moment, we believe that will be another year of stepped-up capital investments before CapEx returns toward historic levels of 2% to 3% of net sales.\r\nSo net-net all these strategic investments behind our people, our brands and our production capabilities, we believe we can deliver underlying operating income growth of 9% to 11% and diluted earnings per share of $3.25 to $3.45. This EPS range assumes a full year tax rate of 30% to 31% and includes a negligible impact from foreign exchange. However, sensitivity on foreign exchange, a 10% move in the dollar in either direction, would impact our full year EPS by approximately $0.14 per share. \r\nOne more quick comment on fiscal 2015. We do expect some volatility in the seasonality of both our underlying and reported results, particularly in the first quarter, as we lap significant buy-ins in the U.S. from aggressive price increases over the last 2 years. We expect our performance over the balance of the year to strengthen following tough Q1 comps.\r\nSo in summary, fiscal 2014 was yet another great year for Brown-Forman, as we drove market-leading growth while simultaneously investing in our long-term strategy. Our free cash flow is impressive, driven by an inherent efficiency that results from a single point of production for much of our focused portfolio.\r\nThis cash affords us the ability to invest in the business while driving a strong balance sheet with net debt down $230 million this year. Our balance sheet flexibility, combined with excess cash, allows us to opportunistically look for suitable M&A, as well as explore ways to return this cash to our shareholders over time, as we did this year when we returned $280 million through quarterly dividends and buybacks. Over the last 10 years, we have returned $3.7 billion to shareholders through a combination of growing dividends, share buybacks and special dividends.\r\nOur great results in 2014, not to mention over longer periods of time, are aided by the long-term horizon of our strong, family-controlled shareholder base. And we believe our prospects remain as bright as ever, driven by our premium spirits portfolio, anchored around the fast-growing American whiskey category.\r\nGlobal demand for whiskey, and Jack Daniel's in particular, is strong and growing. And we believe the long-term opportunities for Brown-Forman are enormous. So with that, I'm going to turn over the call to Paul for his comments.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nThank you, Jane, and good morning to everybody. I'll just add a few comments to what Jane has done here this morning. In general, I thought we had just another great year overall. And I think our relative TSR performance over 4 horizons, 1, 3, 5 and 10 years, provide what I consider to be perhaps the finest summary statement about the quality of our fiscal year 2014, as well as the many successful years that have preceded it. Across all 4 of these time horizons, Brown-Forman's absolute and relative TSRs are impressive, in my view. Our annual total shareholder return over 10 years was 17%, significantly outperforming our industry competitive set, consumer staples and the S&P 500. In fact, Brown-Forman's at the very top of this benchmark set over the 3-, 5- and 10-year horizons, with only Beam outperforming us on the 1-year as a result of their sale to Suntory.\r\nNow Jane highlighted the 2 biggest reasons for our F '14 outperformance relative to the industry. Those were: one, our strong exposure to, and category leadership of, the premium American whiskey segment, which continues to have excellent momentum; and two, our geographically balanced contributions from both developed and emerging markets alike. I believe that in combination, these 2 descriptors help make Brown-Forman unique today in the global spirits business. \r\nLed by our multi-decade work on the amazing Jack Daniel's trademark, Brown-Forman has and continues to play the lead role in expanding the appeal of premium American whiskey to more than 160 countries worldwide. Globally, consumers have come to appreciate Jack Daniel's and American whiskey for an abundance of attributes that I believe include taste, quality, heritage, premiumness and authenticity.\r\nAt the very same time, consumers also enjoy Jack Daniel's' mixability, modern popularity and its accessible, less formal, down-to-earth brand personality. As I've said in the past, I think Jack Daniel's and American whiskey uniquely possess attributes of both scotch and vodka, 2 of the world's largest and most important distilled spirits categories globally. And as you've heard here this morning, our FY '15 investment posture and earnings guidance reflect our belief that this appeal will continue. \r\nAnd my belief in our growth prospects extends well beyond just the next 12 months, as both Jack Daniel's and American whiskey's share of the global whiskey market, despite their wonderful development over the last decade, remain at relatively low levels. Accordingly, our short-, mid- and long-range plans prioritize the continued development of strong trademarks against the global whiskey opportunity, something we know very well with the Jack Daniel's trademark leading the way. And we will pursue the global whiskey opportunity with some superb assets in hand. These include our whiskey trademarks, like Jack Daniel's, Woodford Reserve, Old Forester, Canadian Mist and Early Times; our distilling and manufacturing operations, which are being expanded as we speak, and these include our unique ownership of barrel-making operations that give us unparalleled control over barrels' supply, cost and innovation; and an expanding influence over our global route to consumer. When paired with our company's collective whiskey knowhow, we feel these high-quality assets and capabilities position Brown-Forman very well to continue its growth and success around the world. \r\nAs in the past, I believe our success will require great ideas, like Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey, consistent investment and the focused efforts of our talented employees worldwide. \r\nThis last reference to the focused efforts of our people is another attribute that I believe is somewhat unique to Brown-Forman relative to our competition. As I consider those in the spirits industry today who are working to build their company's global, I don't know of another company who prioritizes the development of a single trademark in their sales and marketing efforts across such a vast global landscape the way we do with Jack Daniel's. And I believe this is a unique advantage for both Jack Daniel's and Brown-Forman. What we may lack in terms of portfolio breadth, scale and size relative to some competition, I believe we more than make up for with intensity and consistency of focus globally. And certainly, the investments we've made over the years in our route to consumer have been one of the key enablers of this. \r\nSo let me summarize why I believe Brown-Forman is a truly unique investment opportunity, and I'll apologize in advance for overusing the word unique here to make my point. We uniquely own Jack Daniel's, the leader of American whiskey and one of the world's largest premium distilled spirits in the world of any kind. This one-of-a-kind brand has the appeal of both scotch and vodka, giving it a vast and somewhat unique global consumer opportunity. We seize that opportunity with a unique set of trademark and manufacturing assets that enable us to efficiently produce 148-year-old brand icons like Jack Daniel's, fast-growing super-premium whiskey brands like Woodford Reserve and successful innovations like Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey. We take these superb brands to the global marketplace with what I believe is a unique and unmatched level of sales and marketing focus. \r\nAnd of course, I'll add to that, that we have the unique commitment and support of the Brown family, who has continuously owned and controlled Brown-Forman for more than 140 years and who remain very committed to the company's enduring and independent success. This combination, in my view, helps produce the uniquely attractive financial results that we share with you today and that we are intent on delivering going forward. \r\nLet me close by simply thanking our employees worldwide for another year of really outstanding results. You are indeed unique to Brown-Forman, as is the culture in which we all work, and none of these results are possible without you. So thank you. This concludes our prepared remarks, and we're now happy to take any questions you might have.",
      "transcript_text3": "I have to say, first off, the top line continues to be great, and they're growing faster than the industry, which is obviously tremendous. I guess I'm a little confused on the top line guidance for next year in 2 ways. So first off, you talked about the category slowing. And if I look at your results on a 1-year or 2-year basis, they're slowing a little bit. There's going to be moderating pricing, and yet it sounds like you're comfortable that you can reaccelerate the top line. So can you walk me through that? And then, I guess, more specifically in Q1, unless my numbers are wrong, I actually have Q1 as your easiest comp of the year. So can you talk a little bit about maybe what we're not seeing in the comp on an underlying basis that makes Q1 such a tough quarter?\n\n---\n\nYes, let me see if I can start off with the first one, and Paul may jump in to share color, too, and I can -- I'll answer the second one, too, but we'll do the first. So let's talk about the top line and why we feel confident that we can achieve the 6% to 8% range of net sales growth that we just provided guidance on for next year. A couple of things. We're actually seeing -- in the U.S., I think you may have seen the most recent NABCA information that our trends are actually improving there. So U.S. is one of our largest markets. It's roughly 40% of our sales. And so that -- we're seeing improving sales there. We had a drag on our earnings this past year, as we've discussed on several times as it related to Mexico. We are not expecting that again next year. In fact, we're seeing improving trends there. We're expecting that to have the inventory giveback situation that we had this particular year. We're also seeing some pricing abilities going on there, pricing power, if you will, as the agave price -- cost of agave has caused suppliers to start increasing their prices in that market. In addition, the third piece that I would point to is France. We knew that when we went to our own distribution model there that it would increase our sales and resulting gross profit. In fact, as I've said in my script this morning, it also flows through to the bottom line, and we'll make profit via that whole operations covering our infrastructure costs. So those 3 things, in addition to the continued growth in emerging markets -- when I look at emerging markets, excluding the Mexico that I just referred to from this year, we continue to grow well above our growth rate for the company, and we expect that to continue. We continue to do around at the same pace that we did in the third quarter once we consider the givebacks that we expected and we communicated during our call in the third quarter. So those are the -- some of the reasons that I would point to.\n\n---\n\nYes. A way I sometimes summarize it is, if you just take the 12-month and think of this as a 6% underlying net sales growth rate, and then you think that's replicable and then you consider the impact of what we think will be improved years, both in the United States and the full-year impact of France, I actually think those are the 2 most significant contributing factors to our enthusiasm. Jane, you want to talk about, first, Q1?\n\n---\n\nYes, let me see if I can take you through the Q1 now according to you thinking that it was going to be an easier comp. I think what we have to do is really rewind time a little bit. 2013 was our first year that we took pricing in a number of years. Recall, we weren't taking pricing during the economic downturn. And so in 2013, our first quarter, we took significant pricing globally. And in particular, in the U.S. was very significant. In fact, if you look at our numbers in the first quarter of 2013, our depletion growth was up 17%. You fast forward it to 2014, we took another significant price increase, and our depletions were basically flat with that. What we're doing in 2015, we're still taking pricing around -- outside the U.S. We're not taking as much. We are still taking price increases in the U.S., but not as much. So what we're expecting is some giveback from that very first year when we took the price increases up and the retailers bought in. So there'll be a reduction in retailer inventory levels, if you will, and that's what we're expecting to be the tough comps at the top line. I also want to mention one other tough comp that I think is worth mentioning as well is on the SG&A line. And the reason why I think that's worthy of mentioning is, recall some of the investments that we made this year. We've been talking about France on a number of calls now, but for the first 8 months of this coming fiscal year, we'll be -- this will be new expenses for us until we start lapping when it came onboard in January. So that, and we have a couple of other investments that we made in the last part of the year, including the cooperage, as well as moving our headquarters in Europe to Amsterdam. And those were all fourth quarter investments, so you're going to see some heavier upfront SG&A spending through the first couple of quarters of the year.\n\n---\n\nAnd one reminder, we have historically, and this is why I think there's such a benefit to doing this, stripped out what I call the shipment-based inventory fluctuations in our quarterly financials as we discussed them with you. And so you'll see these reconciliations between reported and underlying that usually include, particularly during these periods of price increases, adjustments for shipment-based inventory. We don't -- it's just too hard for us to estimate what the depletion-based versions are, and I think that's the major source of this U.S. tough comp that we're going to have is just buy-ins. Now remember, we will get back the benefit of not having -- and you'd expect to get those perhaps in Q2, where you don't have all the giveback that was associated with those buy-ins before. So it's a very logical sequence. And we're just trying to highlight for you that it could impact our Q1. But as we unfold the remainder of FY '15, we expect it to fall in the range of what we're providing to you today.\n\n---\n\nI guess, my question is just some elaboration on your decision to maybe take a little bit more modest pricing in the U.S. Sales have obviously been relatively healthy for you guys. So just in terms of maybe thinking about portfolio as a whole, is this really for the broad-based portfolio, you're taking a little bit more modest pricing approach? What is sort of driving your decision to do that, and just what you're seeing from a competitive perspective, perhaps, as well?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think it's probably a combination of a couple of factors from that vantage point. And Jane, you add to this. I think we outpaced the market with Jack Daniel's. And so we don't just manage the brand for its immediate financial success. And so one of the things we're always trying to monitor and evaluate is how the consumer response is. And it's my view that the consumption of these brands is really important to their brand equity, not just the purchasing of them and the consumer's willingness to pay what we will hope to be higher prices. But their enjoyment of the brands with -- particularly with other people is one of the contributing factors, I think, to brand equity in this business. And so, I mean, I've always been a fan of closely monitoring the balance of volumetric contributions alongside the pricing ones. And I just feel like we leaned so heavily in the United States over the last 2 years on the pricing. I felt back 24 or 30 months ago that, that was the right thing to do, to reinforce premiumness and some of the things that we were seeing that we thought Jack Daniel's, particularly in the United States, might have needed to reinforce because of the developing American whiskey segment above it in terms of price. But you go through that process, you look at it. I don't regret the pricing that we've taken over the last 24 months. I just think it's a good year to be more moderate and let the consumer and the trades settle in to these pricing levels of Jack Daniel's as we go along. So I mean, it's really more based on just a balancing act of brand equity development and -- while recognizing that volume contributions and pricing contributions are different as it affects our P&L.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then just staying on the U.S., you talked about the year starting off a little bit slowly, and you've seen some improvement recently. Can you just maybe talk about what you think has sort of driven the year to start off slowly, and then what's driving the recent improvement? And then just in terms of what you're seeing in on-premise in particular, as you called out that, that channel has been particularly soft, do you see any signs of that channel perhaps improving?\n\n---\n\nI can talk a little bit about the latter one. Of course, I think the most recent information from the restaurant traffic count that -- this came out in the last couple of days, is showing some improving trends in the on-promise. In terms of our sales, as we look through our results through our most recent NABCA information, we actually did see some improving trends, still declining, but some improving trends. I do think that, as we talked on the last call, there's several things impacting the on-premise from economic trends: the consumer confidence; the young millennials in terms of their unemployment is the highest among all sectors of the population, and so there's been a move for them to consume maybe not on-premise, but in the off-premise; and then, of course, the long and unusually cold winter that we had that didn't really end until, I guess, March, end of March. So we think all those things have improvement. So we're optimistic that we're seeing some improvement in the trends of what we saw yesterday from the restaurant and then our most recent trends, but they're still down because of all these other factors.\n\n---\n\nYes, and I mean, I'll just add, I think that we talked about it on the last call, I think there's always the quarterly or weekly references to everything from traffic counts to weather. I think the more interesting thing we're trying to consider is, and particularly for the U.S. market, but is whether or not there is a just fundamental change between on and off that is either consumer related to particularly the young adults of today or there's just an inherent price sensitivity and advantage to drinking in the off-premise that has been accentuated. And so those are, I think, critical things for us to think about, and our people in the United States are thinking about how they support the on- and off-premise knowing that both of the channels are vital to this business. But on the margins, the off-premise continues to do better than the on-premise. And I think I really do feel like the off-premise numbers just leaned more heavily in these last 2 years as an industry, and it reinforces the comments I made just a minute ago, on pricing versus volumetric growth. Still healthy growth for the industry and doing well within beverage alcohol, but you do have to know that people, particularly when there's difficult or more difficult economic times, that they will be more hesitant as prices are going up for the industry. So I think people -- I noticed that in the first year when we went up in the United States, we did not outpace the competition as much as the cumulative impact of years 1 and 2 with our second year of price increases as I think many in the industry, particularly in non-brown spirits, were moderating their pricing. And so that's something you pay attention to. And I think that can have an impact on on-premise trends, off-premise trends, too, in the split between pricing and volume. And then I think you had another question, and I just would refer back to our earlier answer, which was why are we starting the year soft? I mean, we really just think that it is the seasonal effect of cycling against pre-price increase buy-ins in the United States that won't exist in Q1 as strongly. And we'll have to lap that quarter, and that could put some pressure on the volumetric results in that Q1. I mean, that's the basic answer to that.\n\n---\n\nA couple of questions, also kind of trying to probe more on the topic of growth and sustainability. One of them is Russia, Turkey, obviously doing very well. Could you comment on how you think those particular markets are evolving? And then kind of more on the developed side of your business, Australia, U.K. and Mexico, obviously different trends there. But as you try to handicap how the future might compare to the recent trends you've seen in those 3 markets, that would be great.\n\n---\n\nWell, I mean, I just -- I'll let -- and maybe first do one on those markets as maybe a grouping. Jane referred to this in her comments that what really differentiated our FY '14, if you study it historically, was the emerging market performance relative to our competition. We've been outperforming a lot of our competitors in the developed, particularly developed international markets, while also because -- or largely because of our success with Tennessee Honey and Woodford Reserve and brands like that, also growing share in the US. So the thing that really stood out to us in FY '14 was the differential performance in emerging markets, even though we saw some difficulties that Jane highlighted in places like Mexico and Poland. I think, going forward, I mean, we're not anticipating -- we don't know what our competition will do in terms of their forecasted growth, but we certainly anticipate the emerging markets continuing to be strong. So I would reference Turkey and Russia -- I mean, certainly, in Eastern Europe, everyone's got a more cautious attitude as it relates to what's happening over there and just the economic world and the impact of what's going on over there. But it hasn't yet changed our posture as it relates to building our brands or making investments, et cetera. So we're continuing to expect nice growth, and I'd say leading growth for our company from the emerging markets, as they've been producing for us in the last many years. The U.K., I think, was one of the markets that had a great year. And it's one of the nice benefits that the U.K. had a nice year when the Australian distilled spirits market was more difficult for everybody, and we were -- we grew a little bit down there, but not as much as we had in some prior years. And so that geographic balance we've got there that we've referenced a couple of times today was really a big help. So having the U.K. and Germany and France have good years if Australia or Mexico or Poland has a little more of a soft one, it -- we can recover as a company.\n\n---\n\nAnd that's great, Paul. In terms of kind of trying to sustain that strength you've seen in the U.K., and potentially even having a pickup in Australia, is that -- are those difficult exercises, or is that kind of more kind of, given the trends you're seeing and the plans you have, something you think reasonable?\n\n---\n\nI mean, we wouldn't be sharing it with you if we didn't think they were reasonable. I mean, maybe a way to think about it is a couple of the things that has been leading the growth for the company have been just the worldwide performance of both the Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey brand, as well as the global rollout of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey. And I would say that our prospects, even though we might deliver, like the example we've been citing today in the United States, the Jack Daniel's results to a different balance of pricing and volume, our hopes and expectations as it relates to Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey, and I'm encouraged that, even I guess out here in year 4 for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey, our organization is similarly optimistic about its continued growth. And then we've got other things that Jane mentioned that we're either testing or rolling out, mostly in the world of Jack Daniel's innovation, that could be encouraging for us, too. So I think all said, I'm really comfortable with the 6% to 8% underlying sales forecast that Jane provided.\n\n---\n\nYes. No, I'd just add on to what Paul said. I mean, in addition to the U.K., we've got a lot of -- the rest of our portfolio, beyond Jack Daniel's, is doing very well, and they're very early in their stages of development. So we're doing very well. It had a great year for Chambord and Tuaca, many of our other brands, Woodford Reserve, Old Forester just getting introduced. So we're very optimistic there. Australia is a tough market, and we know that it was this year. The economy is tough, the excise taxes that they take twice a year, and we continue to worry about that in terms of the accessibility and affordability of our brands to the consumers. And it is the one that we continue to expect some toughness in the next year.\n\n---\n\nThe one thing I would cite to that I continue to think is unique, I mentioned some of these in my comments is, relative to -- our skew to American whiskey, and within American whiskey, to Jack Daniel's, in this regard is a real advantage as it relates to the question you asked. There are not a lot of brands -- I can only count a couple on -- it'd be less than 5 that have the geographic breadth of Jack Daniel's, not only in performance today, but opportunity. And I think that is something that encourages us. I mean, we can't forecast what's going to happen in every single market, but the ability to continue to develop Jack Daniel's across 160 countries or more, and in a large number of them, we're at very early stage of development, is one of the things that gives us the encouragement here.\n\n---\n\nThat's great. And if I could, I had 2 follow-ups, one on what you just said, Paul and Jane, and then just on gross margin outlook. But what you just said seems to help you kind of manage the complexity that any company facing the growth and the different rates of growth around the world that you're facing. But nonetheless, it seems that complexity is nonetheless going up for your business: the geographic trends, the emphasis on different flavors, the SKU count. Can you just speak to how you think, as a CEO and as a team, you organizationally are getting better at managing complexity? And then as I said, I had a gross margin question.\n\n---\n\nYes, I mean, certainly, doing business that widely brings in all kinds of necessities to do it well, everything from encountering regulatory threats or these things that we call dark markets, where they put restrictions on marketing communications, you're always developing new capabilities and skills associated with it. I mean, I do think we bring to the world these assets that I've referred to, but I mean, I'd be foolish not to think that we're not going to be a much smarter organization about all this in 5 years' or 8 years' time. I mean, we have to continue to learn new things in some of these markets and then actually make sure we act on what we learn. I mean, I think we're pretty good at it. I mean, we certainly know how to do the Jack Daniel's and American whiskey part, we feel. We've been at it now for, on an active basis, 20 years to 30 years globalizing Jack. And we were -- I think we're correctly and continue to be pretty conservative about how quickly to extend it. We've been encouraged by the sort of results we've had with line extensions or new brands that come from Jack Daniel's. Those do add complexity, I agree with you. So one of the things you can do to make sure you do it well is to test, and that's why we do this testing. And I mean real market tests in addition to the just observing social media or going and doing stage-testing. So those -- and I think those are the things that are helpful to us. The experience of our people. We have a lot of people. I mean, one of the things I'm proud of as relates to the 10-year results of the company, the average tenure of the people at our company is above 10 years. So the average employee of Brown-Forman sort of owns these results, and that's really encouraging. I mean, they had all the good and bad of all those times and still were able to produce just really exceptional results. So I think the experience and knowhow of people who have been doing this for a while all over the world is a big help. So those are some of the things that I think that contribute. But I mean, I'll give you one -- let me just give you one reference to something that, in this area, we'll be considering. Jane mentioned Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire, for example, and we'll be really thoughtful about how to enter with a possible other entrant, on a broader scale than the test, into that market. And so when you go to think about that -- I mean, you asked how I think about it. Here's an example of that. I mean, on the one hand, I'll be thinking about the development of the Jack Daniel's trademark in the company and what's best for it over a 5- and 10-year period to make sure we're doing all the right things. And -- but at the same time, I'm sitting and looking at a category that, in the United States alone, if you just -- just our recent estimates of what's happening with flavored whiskey as a segment in the United States, the latest numbers have it significantly larger than the -- I'll just cite the Irish whiskey category or the cognac category. And if the more recent 3-month trends related to flavored whiskey as a general segment reflect that continued growth, I mean, it'll be larger than Scotch pretty soon. And so you're sitting in your wing, you don't want to be too slow or too fast on either one of those, and so we've put in place market tests and then metrics we're going to evaluate to ensure that we do all the right things. And those include everything from cannibalization to impact on the parent brand to any number of other both quantitative and qualitative measures. So does that help as an example?\n\n---\n\nAbsolutely, very much so, and the whole response are very helpful. Last one, just the guide on the gross margin, I can't tell if there's something really incrementally not going to be as powerful this fiscal year as last fiscal year or if it's just conservatism on your part. Can you just talk a little bit about how things might break for or against you in terms of input costs and mix relative to the gross margin guide?\n\n---\n\nYes. So as I talked about in my script that we are expecting to continue to expand our gross margins. So you will see gross margin improvement this next year, just a little bit more moderate than what we saw this year, the 100 basis points that we delivered this past year. Recall what we said earlier: we're taking a little bit more moderate price increase in the U.S., so that in and of itself will make the gross margin not quite expand as far as it did this past year. We're still expecting favorable mix to happen, so -- via organic growth, and so we're still expecting that. So if I were to think about the gross margin, I think of it in 2 parts, really: Improvement due to France; again, we used to pay a margin to our distributor to distribute our products there. We're not paying that anymore, so that'll drop down to your gross profit. And then we are expecting some price increases, as we talked globally, but just not as much as we had this last year. And that will more than offset the cost of inflation on COGS, but not as much as it did this past year. And that's the 2 pieces.\n\n---\n\nAnd mix from -- either from a geographic or from a product standpoint, any thoughts on how that might play out, your plans versus what we saw last year?\n\n---\n\nYes, that's actually in my organic side of the equation, if you will. That's price/mix, so I expect it to be more balanced, if you will.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And the 2 you gave us on price, was that inclusive of mix, or that's purely the rate, plus mix would be on top of that?\n\n---\n\nThat would -- mix would be on top of that.\n\n---\n\nThis is Stephanie in for Bill. I just have a quick question, kind of going off the last on just gross margin. Could you actually break out the portion of this quarter's gross margin expansion and what was due to the distribution transition in France? And then kind of, do you expect that same kind of magnitude to continue into kind of all the way to 3Q '15? And then just I have a quick question on the Jack Daniel's Fire rollout and just kind of the timing on that.\n\n---\n\nI'll tell you what, we'll get back to you on the margin for France. I don't have that specifically into Q4. We do expect it to -- again, as I just spoke to the margin expansion for next year, it will help us there have some margin expansion. And then...\n\n---\n\nThe other question was on Tennessee Fire. I mean, it's just -- we just literally have gone into test here in the last, I mean, I think, 12 weeks or so, 10 weeks or something. And so we're going to at least start to see first -- we haven't seen any quantitative data. So I think we're going to need to see a little bit of that. And I mean, I suspect we'll be commenting to you all on each -- sort of a quarterly update about how things are going and what our expectations are, but there's no -- we have no preset timing as to when the test is over. We're really just going to put -- we think it's really smart to put it into a real market test and observe it and then digest the results and make decisions based on that. So we'll keep you posted.\n\n---\n\nWell, thank you, Laurie, and thanks to all of you for joining us today for our fourth quarter earnings call. Please feel free to reach out to us if you have any additional questions, and have a great week.\n\n---\n\nThank you.\n\n---\n\nThanks.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: John Faucher (Analysts)】\nI have to say, first off, the top line continues to be great, and they're growing faster than the industry, which is obviously tremendous. I guess I'm a little confused on the top line guidance for next year in 2 ways. So first off, you talked about the category slowing. And if I look at your results on a 1-year or 2-year basis, they're slowing a little bit. There's going to be moderating pricing, and yet it sounds like you're comfortable that you can reaccelerate the top line. So can you walk me through that? And then, I guess, more specifically in Q1, unless my numbers are wrong, I actually have Q1 as your easiest comp of the year. So can you talk a little bit about maybe what we're not seeing in the comp on an underlying basis that makes Q1 such a tough quarter?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nYes, let me see if I can start off with the first one, and Paul may jump in to share color, too, and I can -- I'll answer the second one, too, but we'll do the first. So let's talk about the top line and why we feel confident that we can achieve the 6% to 8% range of net sales growth that we just provided guidance on for next year. A couple of things. We're actually seeing -- in the U.S., I think you may have seen the most recent NABCA information that our trends are actually improving there. So U.S. is one of our largest markets. It's roughly 40% of our sales. And so that -- we're seeing improving sales there. We had a drag on our earnings this past year, as we've discussed on several times as it related to Mexico. We are not expecting that again next year. In fact, we're seeing improving trends there. We're expecting that to have the inventory giveback situation that we had this particular year. We're also seeing some pricing abilities going on there, pricing power, if you will, as the agave price -- cost of agave has caused suppliers to start increasing their prices in that market. In addition, the third piece that I would point to is France. We knew that when we went to our own distribution model there that it would increase our sales and resulting gross profit. In fact, as I've said in my script this morning, it also flows through to the bottom line, and we'll make profit via that whole operations covering our infrastructure costs. So those 3 things, in addition to the continued growth in emerging markets -- when I look at emerging markets, excluding the Mexico that I just referred to from this year, we continue to grow well above our growth rate for the company, and we expect that to continue. We continue to do around at the same pace that we did in the third quarter once we consider the givebacks that we expected and we communicated during our call in the third quarter. So those are the -- some of the reasons that I would point to.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nYes. A way I sometimes summarize it is, if you just take the 12-month and think of this as a 6% underlying net sales growth rate, and then you think that's replicable and then you consider the impact of what we think will be improved years, both in the United States and the full-year impact of France, I actually think those are the 2 most significant contributing factors to our enthusiasm. Jane, you want to talk about, first, Q1?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nYes, let me see if I can take you through the Q1 now according to you thinking that it was going to be an easier comp. I think what we have to do is really rewind time a little bit. 2013 was our first year that we took pricing in a number of years. Recall, we weren't taking pricing during the economic downturn. And so in 2013, our first quarter, we took significant pricing globally. And in particular, in the U.S. was very significant. In fact, if you look at our numbers in the first quarter of 2013, our depletion growth was up 17%. You fast forward it to 2014, we took another significant price increase, and our depletions were basically flat with that. What we're doing in 2015, we're still taking pricing around -- outside the U.S. We're not taking as much. We are still taking price increases in the U.S., but not as much. So what we're expecting is some giveback from that very first year when we took the price increases up and the retailers bought in. So there'll be a reduction in retailer inventory levels, if you will, and that's what we're expecting to be the tough comps at the top line. I also want to mention one other tough comp that I think is worth mentioning as well is on the SG&A line. And the reason why I think that's worthy of mentioning is, recall some of the investments that we made this year. We've been talking about France on a number of calls now, but for the first 8 months of this coming fiscal year, we'll be -- this will be new expenses for us until we start lapping when it came onboard in January. So that, and we have a couple of other investments that we made in the last part of the year, including the cooperage, as well as moving our headquarters in Europe to Amsterdam. And those were all fourth quarter investments, so you're going to see some heavier upfront SG&A spending through the first couple of quarters of the year.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nAnd one reminder, we have historically, and this is why I think there's such a benefit to doing this, stripped out what I call the shipment-based inventory fluctuations in our quarterly financials as we discussed them with you. And so you'll see these reconciliations between reported and underlying that usually include, particularly during these periods of price increases, adjustments for shipment-based inventory. We don't -- it's just too hard for us to estimate what the depletion-based versions are, and I think that's the major source of this U.S. tough comp that we're going to have is just buy-ins. Now remember, we will get back the benefit of not having -- and you'd expect to get those perhaps in Q2, where you don't have all the giveback that was associated with those buy-ins before. So it's a very logical sequence. And we're just trying to highlight for you that it could impact our Q1. But as we unfold the remainder of FY '15, we expect it to fall in the range of what we're providing to you today.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Judy Hong (Analysts)】\nI guess, my question is just some elaboration on your decision to maybe take a little bit more modest pricing in the U.S. Sales have obviously been relatively healthy for you guys. So just in terms of maybe thinking about portfolio as a whole, is this really for the broad-based portfolio, you're taking a little bit more modest pricing approach? What is sort of driving your decision to do that, and just what you're seeing from a competitive perspective, perhaps, as well?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nYes, I think it's probably a combination of a couple of factors from that vantage point. And Jane, you add to this. I think we outpaced the market with Jack Daniel's. And so we don't just manage the brand for its immediate financial success. And so one of the things we're always trying to monitor and evaluate is how the consumer response is. And it's my view that the consumption of these brands is really important to their brand equity, not just the purchasing of them and the consumer's willingness to pay what we will hope to be higher prices. But their enjoyment of the brands with -- particularly with other people is one of the contributing factors, I think, to brand equity in this business. And so, I mean, I've always been a fan of closely monitoring the balance of volumetric contributions alongside the pricing ones. And I just feel like we leaned so heavily in the United States over the last 2 years on the pricing. I felt back 24 or 30 months ago that, that was the right thing to do, to reinforce premiumness and some of the things that we were seeing that we thought Jack Daniel's, particularly in the United States, might have needed to reinforce because of the developing American whiskey segment above it in terms of price. But you go through that process, you look at it. I don't regret the pricing that we've taken over the last 24 months. I just think it's a good year to be more moderate and let the consumer and the trades settle in to these pricing levels of Jack Daniel's as we go along. So I mean, it's really more based on just a balancing act of brand equity development and -- while recognizing that volume contributions and pricing contributions are different as it affects our P&L.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Judy Hong (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then just staying on the U.S., you talked about the year starting off a little bit slowly, and you've seen some improvement recently. Can you just maybe talk about what you think has sort of driven the year to start off slowly, and then what's driving the recent improvement? And then just in terms of what you're seeing in on-premise in particular, as you called out that, that channel has been particularly soft, do you see any signs of that channel perhaps improving?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nI can talk a little bit about the latter one. Of course, I think the most recent information from the restaurant traffic count that -- this came out in the last couple of days, is showing some improving trends in the on-promise. In terms of our sales, as we look through our results through our most recent NABCA information, we actually did see some improving trends, still declining, but some improving trends. I do think that, as we talked on the last call, there's several things impacting the on-premise from economic trends: the consumer confidence; the young millennials in terms of their unemployment is the highest among all sectors of the population, and so there's been a move for them to consume maybe not on-premise, but in the off-premise; and then, of course, the long and unusually cold winter that we had that didn't really end until, I guess, March, end of March. So we think all those things have improvement. So we're optimistic that we're seeing some improvement in the trends of what we saw yesterday from the restaurant and then our most recent trends, but they're still down because of all these other factors.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nYes, and I mean, I'll just add, I think that we talked about it on the last call, I think there's always the quarterly or weekly references to everything from traffic counts to weather. I think the more interesting thing we're trying to consider is, and particularly for the U.S. market, but is whether or not there is a just fundamental change between on and off that is either consumer related to particularly the young adults of today or there's just an inherent price sensitivity and advantage to drinking in the off-premise that has been accentuated. And so those are, I think, critical things for us to think about, and our people in the United States are thinking about how they support the on- and off-premise knowing that both of the channels are vital to this business. But on the margins, the off-premise continues to do better than the on-premise. And I think I really do feel like the off-premise numbers just leaned more heavily in these last 2 years as an industry, and it reinforces the comments I made just a minute ago, on pricing versus volumetric growth. Still healthy growth for the industry and doing well within beverage alcohol, but you do have to know that people, particularly when there's difficult or more difficult economic times, that they will be more hesitant as prices are going up for the industry. So I think people -- I noticed that in the first year when we went up in the United States, we did not outpace the competition as much as the cumulative impact of years 1 and 2 with our second year of price increases as I think many in the industry, particularly in non-brown spirits, were moderating their pricing. And so that's something you pay attention to. And I think that can have an impact on on-premise trends, off-premise trends, too, in the split between pricing and volume. And then I think you had another question, and I just would refer back to our earlier answer, which was why are we starting the year soft? I mean, we really just think that it is the seasonal effect of cycling against pre-price increase buy-ins in the United States that won't exist in Q1 as strongly. And we'll have to lap that quarter, and that could put some pressure on the volumetric results in that Q1. I mean, that's the basic answer to that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Swartzberg (Analysts)】\nA couple of questions, also kind of trying to probe more on the topic of growth and sustainability. One of them is Russia, Turkey, obviously doing very well. Could you comment on how you think those particular markets are evolving? And then kind of more on the developed side of your business, Australia, U.K. and Mexico, obviously different trends there. But as you try to handicap how the future might compare to the recent trends you've seen in those 3 markets, that would be great.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nWell, I mean, I just -- I'll let -- and maybe first do one on those markets as maybe a grouping. Jane referred to this in her comments that what really differentiated our FY '14, if you study it historically, was the emerging market performance relative to our competition. We've been outperforming a lot of our competitors in the developed, particularly developed international markets, while also because -- or largely because of our success with Tennessee Honey and Woodford Reserve and brands like that, also growing share in the US. So the thing that really stood out to us in FY '14 was the differential performance in emerging markets, even though we saw some difficulties that Jane highlighted in places like Mexico and Poland. I think, going forward, I mean, we're not anticipating -- we don't know what our competition will do in terms of their forecasted growth, but we certainly anticipate the emerging markets continuing to be strong. So I would reference Turkey and Russia -- I mean, certainly, in Eastern Europe, everyone's got a more cautious attitude as it relates to what's happening over there and just the economic world and the impact of what's going on over there. But it hasn't yet changed our posture as it relates to building our brands or making investments, et cetera. So we're continuing to expect nice growth, and I'd say leading growth for our company from the emerging markets, as they've been producing for us in the last many years. The U.K., I think, was one of the markets that had a great year. And it's one of the nice benefits that the U.K. had a nice year when the Australian distilled spirits market was more difficult for everybody, and we were -- we grew a little bit down there, but not as much as we had in some prior years. And so that geographic balance we've got there that we've referenced a couple of times today was really a big help. So having the U.K. and Germany and France have good years if Australia or Mexico or Poland has a little more of a soft one, it -- we can recover as a company.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Swartzberg (Analysts)】\nAnd that's great, Paul. In terms of kind of trying to sustain that strength you've seen in the U.K., and potentially even having a pickup in Australia, is that -- are those difficult exercises, or is that kind of more kind of, given the trends you're seeing and the plans you have, something you think reasonable?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nI mean, we wouldn't be sharing it with you if we didn't think they were reasonable. I mean, maybe a way to think about it is a couple of the things that has been leading the growth for the company have been just the worldwide performance of both the Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey brand, as well as the global rollout of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey. And I would say that our prospects, even though we might deliver, like the example we've been citing today in the United States, the Jack Daniel's results to a different balance of pricing and volume, our hopes and expectations as it relates to Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey, and I'm encouraged that, even I guess out here in year 4 for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey, our organization is similarly optimistic about its continued growth. And then we've got other things that Jane mentioned that we're either testing or rolling out, mostly in the world of Jack Daniel's innovation, that could be encouraging for us, too. So I think all said, I'm really comfortable with the 6% to 8% underlying sales forecast that Jane provided.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nYes. No, I'd just add on to what Paul said. I mean, in addition to the U.K., we've got a lot of -- the rest of our portfolio, beyond Jack Daniel's, is doing very well, and they're very early in their stages of development. So we're doing very well. It had a great year for Chambord and Tuaca, many of our other brands, Woodford Reserve, Old Forester just getting introduced. So we're very optimistic there. Australia is a tough market, and we know that it was this year. The economy is tough, the excise taxes that they take twice a year, and we continue to worry about that in terms of the accessibility and affordability of our brands to the consumers. And it is the one that we continue to expect some toughness in the next year.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nThe one thing I would cite to that I continue to think is unique, I mentioned some of these in my comments is, relative to -- our skew to American whiskey, and within American whiskey, to Jack Daniel's, in this regard is a real advantage as it relates to the question you asked. There are not a lot of brands -- I can only count a couple on -- it'd be less than 5 that have the geographic breadth of Jack Daniel's, not only in performance today, but opportunity. And I think that is something that encourages us. I mean, we can't forecast what's going to happen in every single market, but the ability to continue to develop Jack Daniel's across 160 countries or more, and in a large number of them, we're at very early stage of development, is one of the things that gives us the encouragement here.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Swartzberg (Analysts)】\nThat's great. And if I could, I had 2 follow-ups, one on what you just said, Paul and Jane, and then just on gross margin outlook. But what you just said seems to help you kind of manage the complexity that any company facing the growth and the different rates of growth around the world that you're facing. But nonetheless, it seems that complexity is nonetheless going up for your business: the geographic trends, the emphasis on different flavors, the SKU count. Can you just speak to how you think, as a CEO and as a team, you organizationally are getting better at managing complexity? And then as I said, I had a gross margin question.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nYes, I mean, certainly, doing business that widely brings in all kinds of necessities to do it well, everything from encountering regulatory threats or these things that we call dark markets, where they put restrictions on marketing communications, you're always developing new capabilities and skills associated with it. I mean, I do think we bring to the world these assets that I've referred to, but I mean, I'd be foolish not to think that we're not going to be a much smarter organization about all this in 5 years' or 8 years' time. I mean, we have to continue to learn new things in some of these markets and then actually make sure we act on what we learn. I mean, I think we're pretty good at it. I mean, we certainly know how to do the Jack Daniel's and American whiskey part, we feel. We've been at it now for, on an active basis, 20 years to 30 years globalizing Jack. And we were -- I think we're correctly and continue to be pretty conservative about how quickly to extend it. We've been encouraged by the sort of results we've had with line extensions or new brands that come from Jack Daniel's. Those do add complexity, I agree with you. So one of the things you can do to make sure you do it well is to test, and that's why we do this testing. And I mean real market tests in addition to the just observing social media or going and doing stage-testing. So those -- and I think those are the things that are helpful to us. The experience of our people. We have a lot of people. I mean, one of the things I'm proud of as relates to the 10-year results of the company, the average tenure of the people at our company is above 10 years. So the average employee of Brown-Forman sort of owns these results, and that's really encouraging. I mean, they had all the good and bad of all those times and still were able to produce just really exceptional results. So I think the experience and knowhow of people who have been doing this for a while all over the world is a big help. So those are some of the things that I think that contribute. But I mean, I'll give you one -- let me just give you one reference to something that, in this area, we'll be considering. Jane mentioned Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire, for example, and we'll be really thoughtful about how to enter with a possible other entrant, on a broader scale than the test, into that market. And so when you go to think about that -- I mean, you asked how I think about it. Here's an example of that. I mean, on the one hand, I'll be thinking about the development of the Jack Daniel's trademark in the company and what's best for it over a 5- and 10-year period to make sure we're doing all the right things. And -- but at the same time, I'm sitting and looking at a category that, in the United States alone, if you just -- just our recent estimates of what's happening with flavored whiskey as a segment in the United States, the latest numbers have it significantly larger than the -- I'll just cite the Irish whiskey category or the cognac category. And if the more recent 3-month trends related to flavored whiskey as a general segment reflect that continued growth, I mean, it'll be larger than Scotch pretty soon. And so you're sitting in your wing, you don't want to be too slow or too fast on either one of those, and so we've put in place market tests and then metrics we're going to evaluate to ensure that we do all the right things. And those include everything from cannibalization to impact on the parent brand to any number of other both quantitative and qualitative measures. So does that help as an example?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Swartzberg (Analysts)】\nAbsolutely, very much so, and the whole response are very helpful. Last one, just the guide on the gross margin, I can't tell if there's something really incrementally not going to be as powerful this fiscal year as last fiscal year or if it's just conservatism on your part. Can you just talk a little bit about how things might break for or against you in terms of input costs and mix relative to the gross margin guide?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nYes. So as I talked about in my script that we are expecting to continue to expand our gross margins. So you will see gross margin improvement this next year, just a little bit more moderate than what we saw this year, the 100 basis points that we delivered this past year. Recall what we said earlier: we're taking a little bit more moderate price increase in the U.S., so that in and of itself will make the gross margin not quite expand as far as it did this past year. We're still expecting favorable mix to happen, so -- via organic growth, and so we're still expecting that.

We're not paying that anymore, so that'll drop down to your gross profit. And then we are expecting some price increases, as we talked globally, but just not as much as we had this last year. And that will more than offset the cost of inflation on COGS, but not as much as it did this past year. And that's the 2 pieces.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Swartzberg (Analysts)】\nAnd mix from -- either from a geographic or from a product standpoint, any thoughts on how that might play out, your plans versus what we saw last year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nYes, that's actually in my organic side of the equation, if you will. That's price/mix, so I expect it to be more balanced, if you will.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Swartzberg (Analysts)】\nGreat. And the 2 you gave us on price, was that inclusive of mix, or that's purely the rate, plus mix would be on top of that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nThat would -- mix would be on top of that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Stephanie Benjamin (Analysts)】\nThis is Stephanie in for Bill. I just have a quick question, kind of going off the last on just gross margin. Could you actually break out the portion of this quarter's gross margin expansion and what was due to the distribution transition in France? And then kind of, do you expect that same kind of magnitude to continue into kind of all the way to 3Q '15? And then just I have a quick question on the Jack Daniel's Fire rollout and just kind of the timing on that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nI'll tell you what, we'll get back to you on the margin for France. I don't have that specifically into Q4. We do expect it to -- again, as I just spoke to the margin expansion for next year, it will help us there have some margin expansion. And then...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nThe other question was on Tennessee Fire. I mean, it's just -- we just literally have gone into test here in the last, I mean, I think, 12 weeks or so, 10 weeks or something. And so we're going to at least start to see first -- we haven't seen any quantitative data. So I think we're going to need to see a little bit of that. And I mean, I suspect we'll be commenting to you all on each -- sort of a quarterly update about how things are going and what our expectations are, but there's no -- we have no preset timing as to when the test is over. We're really just going to put -- we think it's really smart to put it into a real market test and observe it and then digest the results and make decisions based on that. So we'll keep you posted.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jason Koval (Executives)】\nWell, thank you, Laurie, and thanks to all of you for joining us today for our fourth quarter earnings call. Please feel free to reach out to us if you have any additional questions, and have a great week.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nThank you.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nThanks.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you, Elise. Welcome, everyone, to Red Hat's earnings call for the first quarter of fiscal 2015. Speakers for today's call will be Jim Whitehurst, President and CEO; and Charlie Peters, Executive Vice President and CFO. Our earnings press release was issued after the market closed today and may be downloaded from redhat.com on the Investor Relations page. \r\nAlso on this page, you will be able to find a historic reconciliation schedule of GAAP to non-GAAP financial metrics, as well as a schedule on currency rates. In addition, any forward-looking statement represents our estimates as of today June 18, 2014, and these estimates or views may change. While the statements -- while the company may elect to update forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so, even if our estimates or views do change. And therefore, you should not rely on these estimates or forward-looking statements as representing our estimates or views as any date subsequent to today.\r\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Tom, and let me add my welcome to all of you joining us on today's call. The first quarter was a strong start to fiscal 2015 and continued the solid momentum with which we exited FY '14. Our investment strategy, which is primarily focused on increasing our sales capacity and driving adoption of our expanding portfolio of technologies, contributed to the strong results that we achieved during the quarter. Some of the highlights include: our fastest total revenue growth rate in 5 quarters; the eighth straight quarter of consistent mid to high teens growth in subscription revenues; and the highest deferred revenue growth in 3 years.\r\nOn the customer and partner front, the main drivers of this growth were the continued demand for Red Hat Linux middleware and cloud offerings. This broad portfolio of technologies, combined with the cross-selling and strong renewals, drove increased Big Deal flow during the quarter. The successful renewal of our largest deals continues to demonstrate the high level of customer loyalty that Red Hat has earned with IT executives. I'm pleased to announce that we again successfully renewed all 25 of our top 25 deals up for renewal during the quarter.\r\nMoreover, these top deals grew at excess of 120% of their previous annualized value. Also within these deals, we saw a number of customers buying multiple technologies from us, including some that purchased 5 to 10 different technology offerings.\r\nWith that overview, let me discuss some of our recent technology highlights. First, in Q1, we held our premier event, the Red Hat Summit, where we experienced a significant increase in the number of CIOs and senior IT executives attending the event. This helped lead to overall record attendance, which was up 35% from the previous year. The main theme at the summit in April was the preview of RHEL 7. I'm pleased to share that we officially launched RHEL 7.0 last week. RHEL 7 is significant because it was designed to meet both modern data center and next-generation IT requirements for cloud, Linux containers and big data. As the world of physical, virtual and cloud systems converge, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 delivers a true foundation for open hybrid cloud that will serve as the backbone for future application architectures.\r\nThe latest version of our flagship technology has several new features, including: enhanced applications development; delivery, portability and isolation through Linux containers across all types of production environment; security-enhanced access from Microsoft Active Directory, which further enables customers to build heterogeneous data centers. In addition, RHEL 7 comes with significant enhancements to security, filesystem, management and performance.\r\nA second highlight is our expanded relationships with SAP and their HANA in-memory database offering. With the release of Red Hat Enterprise Linux for SAP HANA, our customers can now standardize all their SAP deployments on Red Hat Enterprise Linux. The expanded relationship gives Red Hat even greater access to the SAP portfolio of solutions, as well as SAP's entire ecosystems of systems integrators, ISVs, OEMs and cloud providers. This enables a new space and revenue opportunity for Red Hat.\r\nThird, we strengthened our position to deliver software-based storage solutions for big data and OpenStack with 2 recent acquisitions. In April, we acquired Inktank, a driving force behind the open source project Ceph. The software-defined storage space that Ceph and Red Hat Storage address has tremendous growth potential. By joining forces with Inktank, Red Hat has expanded its footprint and can offer more comprehensive storage solutions to customers for block, object and end file storage. In addition, Ceph block storage technology has integrated into OpenStack and considered the de facto standard by the OpenStack community. Inktank has preexisting partnerships with Alcatel-Lucent, eNovance and Dell, and its Ceph technology has been deployed in production at Bloomberg, CERN, Cisco and Deutsche Telekom, among others.\r\nToday, we also announced our intention to acquire Red Hat consulting Partner, eNovance, a provider of cloud infrastructure services for enterprises and service providers. Like Red Hat and Inktank, eNovance is at the forefront of the OpenStack community. The company is one of the top 10 contributors to the upstream OpenStack project and is the only European Gold Member company on the OpenStack Foundation.\r\neNovance has approximately 150 global customers, including Alcatel-Lucent, Cisco, Cloudwatt and Ericsson. With eNovance as a partner of the Red Hat -- as a part of the Red Hat consulting team, we can enhance our consulting resources to be able to reach more customers with world-class OpenStack technologies and implementation services.\r\nIn summary, Q1 was a great start to our new fiscal year, and we are optimistic about our outlook for the remainder of the year. Our sales organization is executing at a high level, and we believe we are benefiting from an improved IT spending environment for open source and cloud-enabling technologies. At the same time, we remain committed to our strategic investments, which are focused on driving further growth in open hybrid cloud computing and big data.\r\nBefore turning the call over to Charlie, I want to welcome the teams from Inktank and eNovance to the Red Hat family. I also want to thank all Red Hat associates around the globe for their continued commitment to driving value for all of our stakeholders. With that, let me turn the call over to Charlie.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Jim. Q1 was a great start to the new fiscal year. It included higher-than-expected growth in virtually all of our key metrics, strong execution by our global sales organization and early returns on some of the investments we've made in our expanded technology portfolio. The strength of our first quarter results, combined with the ongoing momentum of our business, gives us confidence to increase our revenue outlook for the full fiscal year, as I'll discuss in more detail in a moment.\r\nFirst, let me share with you some of the highlights from this quarter. For the first time in a long time, changes in foreign exchange rates have had minimal impact on our results when comparing them against Q1 last year, last quarter or against guidance. As a result, I will focus on U.S. dollar results. For those interested in the foreign exchange changes, we have provided a table in the press release that shows the details.\r\nSome of the Q1 highlights include: year-over-year subscription revenue growth of 18%; year-over-year total revenue growth of 17%; year-over-year billings growth of 17%, which led to year-over-year short-term deferred revenue growth of 18% and long-term deferred revenue growth of 25%; and operating cash flow of $165 million, which grew 16% year-over-year.  The sales team did a great job in every region.\r\nAs Jim discussed, we continue to drive higher levels of large deal activity due to renewal strength and cross-selling of technologies. Let me provide you with some additional details on the largest deals closed in the quarter.\r\nFor the first time in a Q1, all of the deals in our top 30 deal metric were over $1 million. We also had a Q1 record with 4 deals that were in excess of $5 million and one that was greater than $10 million. \r\nCross-selling was strong, with 65% of these deals, including one or more components from our group of application development and emerging technologies offerings, such as middleware, OpenStack, OpenShift, CloudForms and storage. Four of these deals were standalone application development and emerging technologies offerings. \r\nThe top 3 deals came from a wide range of industries. The top verticals were telecom and cloud, followed by our broad mainstream vertical. Health care was the top segment of the mainstream results. In addition, the government sector had a strong showing in the top deals as that sector continues to recover from last year's impact of sequestration.\r\nNow let's turn to our financial performance. On a geographic basis, this quarter produced solid double-digit growth across all major geographies. 56% of bookings came from the Americas, 25% from EMEA and 19% from Asia Pacific versus a 54%, 25%, 21% split in Q1 last year.\r\nThe Q1 sales route mix was relatively consistent with 67% from the channel and 33% from our direct sales force versus a 68%-32% split in Q1 last year. This is close to our long-term annual goal of a 70% channel, 30% direct split, although one should expect seasonal quarterly fluctuations in this metric.\r\nOur billings proxy, which we calculate by adding revenue plus the change in deferred revenue on the cash flow statement, experienced its normal Q1 seasonality. The billings proxy was $404 million for the quarter, up 17% year-over-year. On a rolling 4-quarters basis, which we believe is a more appropriate way to evaluate this metric and the one I intend to use going forward, the growth in billings is 18%, up from 13% in the year-ago quarter, showing improving momentum.\r\nNow let's shift to the income statement. First quarter revenue was $424 million, a 17% increase year-over-year and 6% sequentially. The main driver of our total revenue growth was subscription revenue of $372 million. \r\nSubscription revenue was up 18% year-over-year, and it's important to point out that this renewable revenue stream now constitutes 88% of total revenue. Revenue exceeded our March guidance primarily due to a larger amount of deals closing earlier in the quarter than forecast and an acceleration in the monthly revenue we get from Red Hat-certified public cloud providers.\r\nAt Red Hat Summit this year, we shared additional disclosures concerning subscription revenue breakout by technology. We believe these additional disclosures are helpful when analyzing our business, so we are now -- we will now be providing quarterly disclosures of these metrics.\r\nSpecifically, the subscription revenue for infrastructure-related offerings was $319 million, up 14% year-over-year, while the subscription revenue for the application development-related and emerging technologies offerings was $53 million, up 45%, and now approximately 13% of total revenue.\r\nAs a reminder, our infrastructure-related offerings include mainly RHEL and RHEL-related offerings, while our application development and emerging technology offering includes middleware plus our newer cloud offerings. The training and services component of revenue was $52 million, up 9% year-over-year and up 6% sequentially.\r\nNow I'll discuss the rest of our results on a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock compensation, amortization expense and business acquisition-related costs, starting with gross margin. \r\nSubscription gross margin was 94%, consistent with Q4. Training and services gross margin was 32%, also consistent with Q4. And overall gross margin was above 86%, again, consistent with Q4 and Q1 last year.\r\nNow moving on to non-GAAP operating expenses. Q1 non-GAAP operating expense came in at $277 million, in line with expectations, and up 23% year-over-year.\r\nPartly as a result of the timing of this year's Red Hat Summit in Q1 versus Q2 last year, sales and marketing grew 26%. We also had several other successful marketing events in Q1 that increased expenses, including the OpenStack Summit, partner meetings and sales kickoffs globally. Further, we have continued to invest in sales headcount, resulting in accelerating bookings, billings and revenue.\r\nR&D grew 22% as we ramped up hiring of engineers for our cloud technologies, and there's a partial quarter of expenses from our acquisition of Inktank. We continued to show leverage in the G&A line, which increased only 10% from last year.\r\nQ1 non-GAAP operating income was $88 million, including $1 million negative impact from the Inktank acquisition, producing an operating margin of 20.8% and in line with our guidance. We would expect operating margin to improve each quarter for the rest of the year due to higher revenues and lower event-related expenses.\r\nNet interest and other income was modestly higher than Q1 last year at approximately $2 million. Our estimated annual effective tax rate was 29% for both GAAP and non-GAAP results. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share came to $0.34, which is $0.01 above the high end of our guidance range.\r\nNow let's turn to the balance sheet and the cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $1.4 billion after spending $152 million on the acquisition of Inktank and $80 million to repurchase approximately 1.6 million shares of Red Hat common stock. We now have $160 million remaining on our stock repurchase authorization. Quarterly operating cash flow of $165 million was up 16% from Q1 last year, in part due to a healthy opening receivables balance and strong collections.\r\nForeign exchange adjusted DSOs continued to be within our target range of 60 days and down 1 day from Q1 last year. As a reminder, since day sales outstanding is traditionally a measure of receivables compared to billings, our DSO is calculated using our billing proxy.\r\nTotal deferred revenue at quarter end was $1.27 billion, an increase of $213 million, or 20% above the same quarter a year ago. Current deferred revenue grew 18% and long-term deferred revenue grew 25% from 1 year ago. Sequentially, and as expected from a seasonality perspective, deferred revenue decreased approximately $17 million from last quarter.\r\nForeign exchange also had little impact on deferred revenue, adding only $1.5 million to each of short-term and long-term deferred revenue. The total decrease in deferred revenue, without the impact of currency changes, was $20 million and can be found on our statement of cash flows.\r\nNow I'd like to turn to guidance, factoring the strong performance of -- in Q1. For purposes of this guidance, I have assumed that average foreign exchange rates for Q2 and the balance of the year are as they were recently. For example, the euro was at $1.36, and JPY 102 equaled $1. I'm also incorporating estimates related to the Inktank acquisition, which closed on April 30, and the eNovance acquisition announced today. Both of these companies were very early stage, venture backed companies with OpenStack. We expect them to add meaningfully to our OpenStack effort. For the remainder of the year, together, they should add approximately $2 million of subscription revenue and $8 million of services revenue and have a dilutive impact on non-GAAP operating margins and EPS of 100 basis points and $0.07 per share, respectively.\r\nWith these assumptions in mind, we are raising our full year revenue guidance by $30 million to a range of $1.760 billion to $1.785 billion, or 16% growth at the top of the range. That rounds to 16% revenue growth with or without these 2 acquisitions.\r\nExcluding these acquisitions, we would be raising our guidance for non-GAAP operating margins and EPS by 50 basis points and $0.05 a share, respectively. However, factoring in the expected dilution from these acquisitions results in a revised full year guidance for non-GAAP operating margin of around 23% and EPS in the range of $1.52 to $1.54 per share. Our operating cash flow guidance is unchanged at $580 million to $600 million for the year.\r\nClearly, organic growth is strong, and we expect improved performance of the base business to offset more than half of the dilution from these acquisitions. These acquisitions are further steps to strengthen our ability to serve customers who need real enterprise-class OpenStack and open hybrid cloud environments. We expect these investments to pay off for years to come.\r\nFor Q2 specifically, I offer the following outlook. Q2 revenue is estimated to be approximately $432 million to $436 million. Operating margin is estimated to be in the 23% area. Interest and other income should be around $2 million and non-GAAP EPS is estimated to be approximately $0.38, assuming the same 29% tax rate.\r\nConsistent with my past practice, I do not forecast quarterly cash flow. However, I would suggest that while estimating cash flow, you consider beginning accounts receivable balance as the starting point in building your estimates.\r\nIn summary, we continue to believe that we're well positioned in our quest to serve our customers in the open hybrid cloud. We further believe that our customers will increasingly turn to Red Hat's innovative technologies and services to help them realize the benefits of cloud computing and big data.\r\nOperator, I'd now like to turn it back to you for the first question.",

The training and services component of revenue was $52 million, up 9% year-over-year and up 6% sequentially.\r\nNow I'll discuss the rest of our results on a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock compensation, amortization expense and business acquisition-related costs, starting with gross margin. \r\nSubscription gross margin was 94%, consistent with Q4. Training and services gross margin was 32%, also consistent with Q4. And overall gross margin was above 86%, again, consistent with Q4 and Q1 last year.\r\nNow moving on to non-GAAP operating expenses. Q1 non-GAAP operating expense came in at $277 million, in line with expectations, and up 23% year-over-year.\r\nPartly as a result of the timing of this year's Red Hat Summit in Q1 versus Q2 last year, sales and marketing grew 26%. We also had several other successful marketing events in Q1 that increased expenses, including the OpenStack Summit, partner meetings and sales kickoffs globally. Further, we have continued to invest in sales headcount, resulting in accelerating bookings, billings and revenue.\r\nR&D grew 22% as we ramped up hiring of engineers for our cloud technologies, and there's a partial quarter of expenses from our acquisition of Inktank. We continued to show leverage in the G&A line, which increased only 10% from last year.\r\nQ1 non-GAAP operating income was $88 million, including $1 million negative impact from the Inktank acquisition, producing an operating margin of 20.8% and in line with our guidance. We would expect operating margin to improve each quarter for the rest of the year due to higher revenues and lower event-related expenses.\r\nNet interest and other income was modestly higher than Q1 last year at approximately $2 million. Our estimated annual effective tax rate was 29% for both GAAP and non-GAAP results. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share came to $0.34, which is $0.01 above the high end of our guidance range.\r\nNow let's turn to the balance sheet and the cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $1.4 billion after spending $152 million on the acquisition of Inktank and $80 million to repurchase approximately 1.6 million shares of Red Hat common stock. We now have $160 million remaining on our stock repurchase authorization. Quarterly operating cash flow of $165 million was up 16% from Q1 last year, in part due to a healthy opening receivables balance and strong collections.\r\nForeign exchange adjusted DSOs continued to be within our target range of 60 days and down 1 day from Q1 last year. As a reminder, since day sales outstanding is traditionally a measure of receivables compared to billings, our DSO is calculated using our billing proxy.\r\nTotal deferred revenue at quarter end was $1.27 billion, an increase of $213 million, or 20% above the same quarter a year ago. Current deferred revenue grew 18% and long-term deferred revenue grew 25% from 1 year ago. Sequentially, and as expected from a seasonality perspective, deferred revenue decreased approximately $17 million from last quarter.\r\nForeign exchange also had little impact on deferred revenue, adding only $1.5 million to each of short-term and long-term deferred revenue. The total decrease in deferred revenue, without the impact of currency changes, was $20 million and can be found on our statement of cash flows.\r\nNow I'd like to turn to guidance, factoring the strong performance of -- in Q1. For purposes of this guidance, I have assumed that average foreign exchange rates for Q2 and the balance of the year are as they were recently. For example, the euro was at $1.36, and JPY 102 equaled $1. I'm also incorporating estimates related to the Inktank acquisition, which closed on April 30, and the eNovance acquisition announced today. Both of these companies were very early stage, venture backed companies with OpenStack. We expect them to add meaningfully to our OpenStack effort. For the remainder of the year, together, they should add approximately $2 million of subscription revenue and $8 million of services revenue and have a dilutive impact on non-GAAP operating margins and EPS of 100 basis points and $0.07 per share, respectively.\r\nWith these assumptions in mind, we are raising our full year revenue guidance by $30 million to a range of $1.760 billion to $1.785 billion, or 16% growth at the top of the range. That rounds to 16% revenue growth with or without these 2 acquisitions.\r\nExcluding these acquisitions, we would be raising our guidance for non-GAAP operating margins and EPS by 50 basis points and $0.05 a share, respectively. However, factoring in the expected dilution from these acquisitions results in a revised full year guidance for non-GAAP operating margin of around 23% and EPS in the range of $1.52 to $1.54 per share. Our operating cash flow guidance is unchanged at $580 million to $600 million for the year.\r\nClearly, organic growth is strong, and we expect improved performance of the base business to offset more than half of the dilution from these acquisitions. These acquisitions are further steps to strengthen our ability to serve customers who need real enterprise-class OpenStack and open hybrid cloud environments. We expect these investments to pay off for years to come.\r\nFor Q2 specifically, I offer the following outlook. Q2 revenue is estimated to be approximately $432 million to $436 million. Operating margin is estimated to be in the 23% area. Interest and other income should be around $2 million and non-GAAP EPS is estimated to be approximately $0.38, assuming the same 29% tax rate.\r\nConsistent with my past practice, I do not forecast quarterly cash flow. However, I would suggest that while estimating cash flow, you consider beginning accounts receivable balance as the starting point in building your estimates.\r\nIn summary, we continue to believe that we're well positioned in our quest to serve our customers in the open hybrid cloud. We further believe that our customers will increasingly turn to Red Hat's innovative technologies and services to help them realize the benefits of cloud computing and big data.\r\nOperator, I'd now like to turn it back to you for the first question.",
      "transcript_text3": "I wanted to just ask you a little bit about RHEL 7. And, Jim, if you look at the Linux marketplace, Linux as a percentage of the overall market, that share has been holding pretty steady. And granted that you guys have done a phenomenal job in the last 3 years, with RHEL 6 improving your revenue content per server, also added to that JBoss, so as you look forward, it feels like Linux as a percentage of the overall server market, is not going up as much. And I'm curious how you drive core business growth rate and what are the levers that could help you grow faster than the growth sort of the overall Linux market. And in particular, if you could talk to some of the levers that you might have on the pricing side with RHEL 7? It feels like RHEL 6 was a big step function from RHEL 5 with respect to pricing of key components in the outlook that you're getting. It feels like you have less of a lift here. So I'm wondering how you think about driving growth in the core business, granted that the emerging technologies are doing fantastic.\n\n---\n\nYes. Thanks, Kash. Well, first off, not sure where your data is on Linux not growing share. I believe it is growing share and, over the next 5 years, IDC expects it to grow share significantly, and the share of paid Linux even grow off of that. And those seem like pretty good numbers. So the compound annual growth rate they had for paid Linux was solid double digits over the next 5 years, and I think we would agree there's an opportunity there. With that said, I think it comes from multiple areas, right? There's still a continued move from mainframe and UNIX to Linux. I was just on the phone today with a massive European customer that is literally just ready to start on the journey right now. We continue to believe we're taking share from Windows, especially with net new workloads. There's a significant amount of innovation going on, just one example that I mentioned in my prepared remarks around containers, right? Containers is basically a Linux-only phenomenon and innovation. And so we expect to continue to win the majority of net new workloads onto OpenSource platforms. And obviously, we do a reasonably good job of monetizing against those. So I still believe share gain is a significant driver of continued growth in the RHEL business, as well as continuing to buy up into higher SKUs. Yes, we don't really have any kind of announcements to make now around pricing or pricing changes around RHEL 7, so we do believe that it continues to become more core and more strategic to a lot of our customers, which, as that value continues to increase, gives us opportunities whether it's with the add-ons or with the core product. But I still think that share shift is still a major component of the RHEL growth story.\n\n---\n\nCan you talk a little bit about the progress you're making around OpenStack in terms of, like, the message was for this year to work on consulting projects? So what clients, those reference cases, to be able to kind of have a product out for 2015, '16? Talk a little bit about the progress you're making there and what you're seeing in terms of adoptions from clients?\n\n---\n\nWell, we are -- I have a number of OpenStack wins. Again, most of those are -- start off small. They are consulting engagements. They are kind of creeping up towards 100 but not quite there in kind of total deals closed. We have deals closed in every region. We've also -- just done the 2 acquisitions, to further strengthen our position, they obviously have a set of customers. Many of those are joint customers, but there are some incremental names that we'll be adding to our customer list associated with it. So it's really proceeding well. We closed one large deal, a multimillion dollar deal, in Q4. And again, we have just a number of nice-sized deals moving forward.\n\n---\n\nJim, back at the Summit, you were talking about how -- you felt like on the distribution side you needed more depth instead of breadth, and Q1 looks like you delivered on some of those goals. I'm curious, as you look out for the rest of the year, how would you sort of grade yourself in terms of progress around achieving real depth and penetration into your accounts? And the success you had in Q1, is this sort of early returns? Is this sort of scratching the surface? Where are we at in that journey?\n\n---\n\nI would say, at this point, we're still in relatively early days. I mean, if you look at RHEL penetration in the Global 1,000, it's very, very, very high. We've shown that as we then work with our partners to concentrate on those customers, we generally can expand out our other product categories. We -- the other product categories are nowhere near as penetrated into that account base, so we can continue to drive that. So that's a big, big, big opportunity for us as we go forward with all the other product categories. We already have credibility with those customers. So I still would say we're very, very early days, especially when you start looking at cloud management, middleware, OpenStack. We have credibility but very little progress so far in terms of hitting those customers. So a lot of growth potential there.\n\n---\n\nThis is Melissa Gorham calling in for Keith. I just have a question on the storage business. First, I was wondering if you can maybe provide an update on the initial traction around the Inktank acquisition and what customer feedback has been? And then secondly, if you could maybe provide some color on what the growth rates are in that business and what you're expecting for the year?\n\n---\n\nSure. I'll start. We've generally gotten very positive comments from customers around the Inktank acquisition. Twofold. One is certainly, a lot of our customers were looking at and/or both using Red Hat Storage and Inktank, and kind of pleased to see those things come together to have basically a single vendor to work to drive those roadmaps. So very, very positive from that regard talking to customers, as well as just a bigger, more stable name behind the project, I think, gives some of our larger customers, a sense of stability around the projects. So very, very positive there. It's very, very early days. Charlie mentioned some subscription numbers. Obviously, the issue there is we start with bookings, and those turn into revenue over a longer period of time. So still early days, but great traction with customers, great set of dialogues happening. But obviously it's only been a couple of months.\n\n---\n\nEspecially a high level of interest with Inktank around OpenStack-related customers.\n\n---\n\nJust want to dig a little bit more on this eNovance acquisition. They are definitely beside OpenStack. They are very active in OpenStack also. They have this managed IT infrastructure. So just wondering how eNovance acquisition going to expand your open hybrid technology in terms of adoption, in terms of OpenShift and other technology besides OpenStack.\n\n---\n\nWell, first, like you rightly identified, that eNovance brings some real capability into Red Hat around managing cloud environments, and I think that's something we're asked a lot for our clients about, and so they'll bring real capability of actually managing OpenStack at scale, that we think we can actually scale that capability broadly around the world to our customer base. So we feel very, very good about that. Yes, I think you're right. We do believe that, that same technology team, it's a great group of people, can actually be very, very helpful as well looking at things like OpenShift and our other cloud technologies to adopt. Just for one example, eNovance is a -- was, even before these acquisitions, a significant Inktank partner. So again, it's bringing these technologies together, and their capabilities can help drive more than just our OpenStack offering.\n\n---\n\nWithin the software-defined data center space, you've clearly addressed the compute layer with both RHEL and RHEV and the storage layer with Gluster and now Inktank. But I'm curious, could you make a bigger splash in the networking layer beyond partnerships with Cisco and, say, support of Nicira through OpenStack?\n\n---\n\nWell, we are a significant part of the OpenDaylight project as well. So we actually do and are building our own internal capability as we work with our partners in OpenDaylight as well. At this point, we're not ready to talk about products or what those might look like, but we are investing heavily in the technology. And when it's ready, we'll obviously be more involved. That's still well behind in terms of maturity storage or compute.\n\n---\n\nI had 2 relatively quick ones. The first one was just that if you could share with us kind of the top 3 items being requested from the OpenStack community that you think could help accelerate the pace of adoption. And then just because we're getting a lot of it from people related to RHEL 7, if you could compare it to other cycles, other releases of RHEL, RHEL 6 or RHEL 5, how fast do you think you see the pace of adoption for people migrating over?\n\n---\n\nYes. Well, I'll start. On OpenStack, number one in terms of product feature is installation and management, right, without a doubt on product feature. And then the rest is really around capability, right, which we call consulting. I mean, they're asking for capability on how to manage workflows, process, all of those type things, which is obviously one of the reasons we looked to acquire eNovance. So those would really be the big ones. And I know management sounds like a broad area. I would say, if I had to break that down, installer, and then just through kind of manageability are the biggest features that we hear about. A little bit around HA, but I would say installer and management, and then broadly around capability, around just how do you build, run, manage around it. In terms of RHEL 7, we always like to warn -- recognize, we sell a subscription to RHEL, not to individual versions. So the relative uptake is not material directly to our revenues because a subscriber can decide when and how to upgrade versions. I will say I think this version, because of some of the new features, is likely to move faster in the sense of things like docker and containers that have been well engineered into RHEL 7. So I do think we'll see more of a pickup around cloud deployment models, because I think there's more change in RHEL 7 to address cloud deployments than -- relatively than 5 to 6. So I think it'll be faster. But again, that impacts revenue when people start using more overall. So it's not a direct 6 to 7 having a revenue impact. So we don't track that quite as carefully as you might think.\n\n---\n\nYou mentioned in your comments 2 or 3 times about the strength in the quarter in the cloud revenues and bookings, so I wouldn't mind drilling in a little bit more there. And 2 questions. One is, exactly where are you seeing that? I know you're certified on a whole bunch of cloud providers. Maybe you could offer a little more color where the strength is coming from. And then, Charlie, if there are any metrics you might give us? I think in the last quarter you said that the cloud revenues were at a -- I think a $36 million revenue run rate, up 40%. Maybe you could update those metrics.\n\n---\n\nYes. So just in terms of cloud providers, we have now over 50 certified -- Red Hat-certified public cloud providers that are offering RHEL by the hour, by the day on a short-term basis. And that revenue was growing nicely, I would say. That revenue accelerated from what we were -- talked about last quarter. I'll come back with the metrics. But the second piece, we also have a program called the Cloud Access program. So that existing Red Hat customers with paid subscriptions from Red Hat can move their paid subscriptions from their own data centers into a public cloud that has a Cloud Access program. This quarter, we added the Google cloud with the Cloud Access program, so there's another major cloud provider out there with Cloud Access. In terms of the metrics, you're right. The last time we talked about this, what I said was for the fourth quarter, we did about $9 million of cloud revenue annualized, that got to the $36 million number. So your memory is right. All I'll say on this call is that the growth rate has accelerated. And probably the next time, we'll give a metric when we hit the $100 million annualized run rate number. But it's growing nicely. It was definitely one of the reasons why we substantially beat guidance for the quarter.\n\n---\n\nCharlie, just a question. You talked a little bit about linearity comments in the quarter, linearity was better. Can you give us a little bit more color there? And I'm curious to see if any deals closed early or you had any pull-ins there.\n\n---\n\nYes. There's no evidence of any pull-ins. But what my commentary was -- again, in terms of the revenue beat, the cloud beat that I just mentioned is certainly part of it. The other piece is the linearity, particularly some big deals in the first month of the quarter certainly helped on daily revenue recognition, and that was a piece of it. But no, I'm not aware of any pull-ins, so to speak.\n\n---\n\nCharlie, you called out health care. It seems like there's a lot of consolidation, the shift to electronic medical records. Can you give us a sense of how sustainable that strength in your pipeline is as it relates to what you saw in Q1 in health care?\n\n---\n\nSo it's interesting because our 4 big verticals have always been telco, financial services, government and then a broad media technology kind of a vertical. And then we have this other group that we call mainstream accounts, and we have kind of grouped health care into mainstream. At some point in time, as it keeps growing, maybe it would be a stand-alone separate vertical. We wouldn't call it part of mainstream. But I think as you point out, health care is going through an information technology change. They have been not on the bleeding edge of adoption, that's for sure, and not like the financial institutions and even government. So I would expect that over time, we're going to see more opportunity for growth in the health care vertical. But I guess that's probably what I'd say about that.\n\n---\n\nCharlie, I just want a view. Is it -- your comments about cloud revenues, can you talk a little bit about what are the big drivers behind them and if they can have any cannibalistic impact on your enterprise sales? And also, with this impact of bring your own subscription plans that you offer with some of these cloud providers, can that slow down the growth rate we've seen in that segment as people kind of bring their own subscription to them?\n\n---\n\nSure. So just a little bit more on cloud providers. We have seen some data from one of the large cloud providers that indicated that in their case, a majority of the business that they're getting is from customers that have indicated to them they were first-time users of Red Hat, so they're net new to us, and that is a really great statistic to the extent that more and more of this business is net new. In other words, customers that we might not have otherwise touched. It's basically another channel of distribution for us. So we hope that continues. But what's driving it is we have a great brand name built over many years of customer support and a certified ecosystem that -- many of these customers are using their own data centers. So if they have a hybrid cloud environment, they want to know that they have the same certification in a Red Hat-certified public cloud provider. That is what I believe is driving our revenue in the public clouds. The other part -- or question about the Cloud Access program, meaning customers that own Red Hat subscriptions or want to actually run it in a public cloud rather than in their data center, we're totally neutral on that. They can run it wherever they like. The price is no different. The public cloud provider is still going to make some revenue in terms of what they charge to simply run for the compute time, but we're neutral in terms of where the customer runs it.\n\n---\n\nTwo questions. One, can you give us any more details? You talked about a strong sales ramp, but can you give us any metrics on how that compares to last year? And also, the guidance relative to the acquisitions, there are some industry estimates out there that eNovance might have been doing in the 8-figure deal range, over $10 million next year. So is there a shift in terms of how you're recognizing that revenue? Is it going to be write-downs? Or are you exiting any of their businesses? So headcount, sales ramp and then eNovance.\n\n---\n\nGood questions, Michael. So on the sales ramp, first of all, since last year, we have added quite a number of additional salespeople, plus we've cross-trained a number of salespeople. And I believe our sales team are feeling very good, and are probably more confident this year than did last year because they've been here longer. So I think we feel good about it. They've been working hard trying to build pipeline for future quarters, and I believe we've done better with that, which is one of the reasons why we have the confidence to raise the revenue guidance range by $30 million. The second question about eNovance, eNovance is a services company and -- manages services company and run a consulting business. So unlike some of the companies that we have acquired that have a subscription business with deferred revenue, this one did not have deferred revenue too that we needed to write down and then sort of start over again. Inktank did -- in fact have a little bit of that. With eNovance, it's an ongoing business that has customers. We will be working hard with them to make the transition to Red Hat. So for the integration process, probably we'll cause a little bit of disruption for a very short period of time as they get on-boarded to Red Hat, and we get going with -- particularly with Red Hat OpenStack, which is what we'll be working hard for them to offer consulting services for.\n\n---\n\nWell, another. Recognize we're also only adding in 8 months, not a full year of revenue because of when we close.\n\n---\n\nCorrect.\n\n---\n\nAnd second -- and I can't speak specifically to the eNovance deals, but I can definitely speak to large Red Hat consulting engagements -- 8-figure-type of consulting engagements are generally multi-year. They're rarely ever delivered in one year. So again, we're talking about 8 months of revenue in this year.\n\n---\n\nSo just a quick question on margins. So it looks like this will be the third year in a row where sales and marketing and R&D outgrow revenue. And I understand massive opportunities around some very big things in front of you, but how should we think about that trend continuing and if and when you think it might abate?\n\n---\n\nI think the product revenue breakdown that we're now providing may give you some help in thinking about it. Because what you see is -- a very large part of our business that has very consistent growth. The largest part of it obviously is the Linux business at 14%. You should assume that, that is a very healthy business. It's doing quite well. The other business this quarter grew at 45%. You could imagine what a P&L might look like for something with that kind of a growth rate. Obviously, investment there is higher, the sales investment there is higher, and even the R&D as a percentage of revenue is higher. But the growth is really going very strong. So we said at the start of the year that it was our intention to invest, to make some conscious decisions to invest this year, particularly around OpenStack and some of the newer cloud technologies, OpenShift and storage. And I think what you see playing out here in the first quarter is just that. That is what we are doing. I think we are following the strategy that we laid out, and the results thus far have been very encouraging. And hopefully, you're encouraged by the increased guidance we've given as well.\n\n---\n\nJust to emphasize that, the $53 million of the other revenue bucket that we talk about is all subscription revenues. That -- yes, we're investing heavily to get it, but the gross margins look pretty similar to our gross margins elsewhere. When you have an opportunity to have the business growing at 53% with high 90s -- or sorry 45%, sorry, $53 million -- 45% at high 90s gross margins, that's something you should invest pretty heavily in. I would -- without seeing everyone else's private company financials, that's got to be, if it were a standalone company, the second-largest open source company by far. Right? So with those kind of growth rates and those kind of margins, I think it's only prudent for us to double down and invest heavily to grow those businesses as fast as we can.\n\n---\n\nAt analyst day, we had some color offered around the cross-selling of products regarding the top 120 deals. Could you update us on that? I believe you gave us a number for all of fiscal '14, but is there any additional color for the current period you could offer?\n\n---\n\nYes, one of the comments that we mentioned was that in the top deals of this quarter, 65% of them had other products sold. So the infrastructure-related it would be sort of the base business, and the application development and emerging technologies were the rest. 65% of the top deals had a combined element, and 4 of them were standalone application development and emerging technology deals. So I would say the cross-selling has gotten better. And we have, along the way, continued to add to the portfolio of things that our sales guys have to sell. So I'm looking forward to that continuing to grow and accelerate.\n\n---\n\nI guess, just to follow up, there's no further color, though, about moving down the impact there? Or is that an annual metric?\n\n---\n\nYou mean give a...\n\n---\n\nThat one's a quarter metric.\n\n---\n\nYes, that's a quarter metric. I'm not sure if what you were implying is to give a rolling 12-month metric. I'm not intending to do that, no.\n\n---\n\nYes, the 120 was the 30 -- top 30 deals over the 4 quarters. So we're updating with this quarter. But yes, we don't roll down past the top -- we don't do the analysis like that below the top 30 deals.\n\n---\n\nBut you could do it, since we've done that same metric every quarter. You could go back to first quarter of last year, drop off the metric from last year and add on the numbers I've just given and come to a 12-month metric like that.\n\n---\n\nJust a couple of quick questions. How many consultants does eNovance have? And then also, Charlie, was there any change in average contract length versus the prior quarter?\n\n---\n\nSure. eNovance brings approximately 110 people with it, and they're not all in consulting. Some are in engineering. In fact, they're the seventh-largest contributor to the upstream OpenStack project, which we think is another big benefit. I'm not sure if we mentioned, but there's at least 40 individuals that have good experience with Ceph, so a big help to the Inktank effort. But there's probably over 60 or 70 who have consulting skills there that will be a big help. To start with, mostly North America and Europe, but the intention will be to use them further than that.\n\n---\n\nI think the other question was the average contract length.\n\n---\n\nThe average contract length was just a shade over 21 months.\n\n---\n\nJim, just around eNovance, could you talk a little bit about just how much the potential -- I guess shortage of skill -- consulting skills around OpenStack is somewhat of a governor on sort of growth in that technology? And I guess what do you think the combination of eNovance's sort of consultants plus your salespeople working together can do to sort of deal cycles? You think that can compress it pretty significantly? You guys did a similar type of deal with Amentra back in '08. I'm just wondering what you sort of learned from that deal in terms of bringing more consulting expertise into the middleware space?\n\n---\n\nWell, I think mainly this will allow us to do more POCs. This -- different technologies than Amentra and middleware -- I don't want to, at this point, say it can compress the time it takes to do a POC, but it certainly will allow us to do substantially more POCs simultaneously. Just one data point on that, we recently had our annual sales president's club, awards club, and Charlie actually asked the question to the salespeople there, \"How many of you could sell incremental OpenStack consulting if we had more people available?\" And I would say at least half the people raised their hands that they could sell more. Now we'll see when we're in the marketplace. But without a doubt, we are constrained in our ability to deliver OpenStack by our lack of enough qualified professional services resources. So without a doubt, this will allow us to do more. Hopefully, it will allow us to speed it up. But most importantly, it will certainly allow us to do more in parallel.\n\n---\n\nYes, just a follow-on question with that. With the Amentra acquisition, there was always sort of a training session and they sort of -- professional services sort of led product deals by about a few quarters. Is that something we could -- should expect here? Or because of the complexity, could it be longer?\n\n---\n\nI don't think it'll be longer. It is a little bit of a different dynamic. Recognize, typically with middleware deals, the consulting wasn't doing a POC. It was actually working to build applications that run on that application infrastructure. So Amentra was doing -- a fair amount of application development itself is part of that. This will -- is more, at least for starters, will be doing more POCs. So this is our ability to get it up and implement it faster. So it is a different sale and a different dynamic around the professional services upfront. What I don't think we know is once it's up and running, will those customers want to keep resources around to help them with it? I think right now, eNovance has demonstrated most customers do want to keep some of those resources around to help them longer term, which is a little different than Amentra as well. But again, I think this is less about needing to develop the application portfolio like we had to with Amentra that runs on the middleware, much more about doing the POCs, proving it works getting the processes in place for people to be able to run it. So a little bit of a different dynamic.\n\n---\n\nTim, I would add the following that I think one of the things that's held back the technology overall is lack of trained individuals globally and customers. And so as we said I think a quarter ago, we have launched a curriculum of 3 or 4 different classes in OpenStack leading to a Red Hat-certified engineer for OpenStack-type of a certification. And I think as you know, we have 50,000 to 60,000 Red Hat-certified engineers out there today certified on RHEL. We -- our goal is to quickly train people globally and have them certified on Red Hat OpenStack.\n\n---\n\nOkay, good. And then just a quick question on the middleware. Obviously, it accelerated nicely Q4 to Q1. Were there any particular products inside the EAP that drove that? Or was it pretty broad?\n\n---\n\nJust to keep in mind, that product is not just middleware, right? It is application development and emerging technology. So middleware is the largest individual component but has been good growth of all of the technologies, including OpenStack, OpenShift, storage and certainly, middleware.\n\n---\n\nYes. I will say, on the middleware side in particular, we just launched our BPM product. It's one of our fastest product launches ever in terms of uptake of product and size of bookings early on. And the integration product suite -- yes. So Fuse have done extremely well and continue to grow nicely as well.\n\n---\n\nI'd just like to go back and just kind of verify something that was said. We talked about strong sales execution. We also talked about expanding sales coverage, and I'm wondering, just trying to parse that, is it just that you have more boots on the street? Or is there an improvement in the execution of the existing sales force? And if there is, any color around that?\n\n---\n\nSteven, in my view, I think we have both. We definitely have more boots on the street because we've been hiring consistently. But I think our sales guys are more experienced. They're better trained. As I said, the confidence level is high, the enthusiasm is high. I think it's a combination of both. So we're very pleased with their performance in the quarter and looking forward to that continuing.\n\n---\n\nWell, that's all we have time for, operator. Thank you, everyone, for joining us, and we look forward to meeting with a number of you over the next few weeks. Thank you.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Kash Rangan (Analysts)】\nI wanted to just ask you a little bit about RHEL 7. And, Jim, if you look at the Linux marketplace, Linux as a percentage of the overall market, that share has been holding pretty steady. And granted that you guys have done a phenomenal job in the last 3 years, with RHEL 6 improving your revenue content per server, also added to that JBoss, so as you look forward, it feels like Linux as a percentage of the overall server market, is not going up as much. And I'm curious how you drive core business growth rate and what are the levers that could help you grow faster than the growth sort of the overall Linux market. And in particular, if you could talk to some of the levers that you might have on the pricing side with RHEL 7? It feels like RHEL 6 was a big step function from RHEL 5 with respect to pricing of key components in the outlook that you're getting. It feels like you have less of a lift here. So I'm wondering how you think about driving growth in the core business, granted that the emerging technologies are doing fantastic.\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nYes. Thanks, Kash. Well, first off, not sure where your data is on Linux not growing share. I believe it is growing share and, over the next 5 years, IDC expects it to grow share significantly, and the share of paid Linux even grow off of that. And those seem like pretty good numbers. So the compound annual growth rate they had for paid Linux was solid double digits over the next 5 years, and I think we would agree there's an opportunity there. With that said, I think it comes from multiple areas, right? There's still a continued move from mainframe and UNIX to Linux. I was just on the phone today with a massive European customer that is literally just ready to start on the journey right now. We continue to believe we're taking share from Windows, especially with net new workloads. There's a significant amount of innovation going on, just one example that I mentioned in my prepared remarks around containers, right? Containers is basically a Linux-only phenomenon and innovation. And so we expect to continue to win the majority of net new workloads onto OpenSource platforms. And obviously, we do a reasonably good job of monetizing against those. So I still believe share gain is a significant driver of continued growth in the RHEL business, as well as continuing to buy up into higher SKUs. Yes, we don't really have any kind of announcements to make now around pricing or pricing changes around RHEL 7, so we do believe that it continues to become more core and more strategic to a lot of our customers, which, as that value continues to increase, gives us opportunities whether it's with the add-ons or with the core product. But I still think that share shift is still a major component of the RHEL growth story.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Raimo Lenschow (Analysts)】\nCan you talk a little bit about the progress you're making around OpenStack in terms of, like, the message was for this year to work on consulting projects? So what clients, those reference cases, to be able to kind of have a product out for 2015, '16? Talk a little bit about the progress you're making there and what you're seeing in terms of adoptions from clients?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nWell, we are -- I have a number of OpenStack wins. Again, most of those are -- start off small. They are consulting engagements. They are kind of creeping up towards 100 but not quite there in kind of total deals closed. We have deals closed in every region. We've also -- just done the 2 acquisitions, to further strengthen our position, they obviously have a set of customers. Many of those are joint customers, but there are some incremental names that we'll be adding to our customer list associated with it. So it's really proceeding well. We closed one large deal, a multimillion dollar deal, in Q4. And again, we have just a number of nice-sized deals moving forward.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jason Maynard (Analysts)】\nJim, back at the Summit, you were talking about how -- you felt like on the distribution side you needed more depth instead of breadth, and Q1 looks like you delivered on some of those goals. I'm curious, as you look out for the rest of the year, how would you sort of grade yourself in terms of progress around achieving real depth and penetration into your accounts? And the success you had in Q1, is this sort of early returns? Is this sort of scratching the surface? Where are we at in that journey?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nI would say, at this point, we're still in relatively early days. I mean, if you look at RHEL penetration in the Global 1,000, it's very, very, very high. We've shown that as we then work with our partners to concentrate on those customers, we generally can expand out our other product categories. We -- the other product categories are nowhere near as penetrated into that account base, so we can continue to drive that. So that's a big, big, big opportunity for us as we go forward with all the other product categories. We already have credibility with those customers. So I still would say we're very, very early days, especially when you start looking at cloud management, middleware, OpenStack. We have credibility but very little progress so far in terms of hitting those customers. So a lot of growth potential there.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Melissa Gorham (Analysts)】\nThis is Melissa Gorham calling in for Keith. I just have a question on the storage business. First, I was wondering if you can maybe provide an update on the initial traction around the Inktank acquisition and what customer feedback has been? And then secondly, if you could maybe provide some color on what the growth rates are in that business and what you're expecting for the year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nSure. I'll start. We've generally gotten very positive comments from customers around the Inktank acquisition. Twofold. One is certainly, a lot of our customers were looking at and/or both using Red Hat Storage and Inktank, and kind of pleased to see those things come together to have basically a single vendor to work to drive those roadmaps. So very, very positive from that regard talking to customers, as well as just a bigger, more stable name behind the project, I think, gives some of our larger customers, a sense of stability around the projects. So very, very positive there. It's very, very early days. Charlie mentioned some subscription numbers. Obviously, the issue there is we start with bookings, and those turn into revenue over a longer period of time. So still early days, but great traction with customers, great set of dialogues happening. But obviously it's only been a couple of months.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nEspecially a high level of interest with Inktank around OpenStack-related customers.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sitikantha Panigrahi (Analysts)】\nJust want to dig a little bit more on this eNovance acquisition. They are definitely beside OpenStack. They are very active in OpenStack also. They have this managed IT infrastructure. So just wondering how eNovance acquisition going to expand your open hybrid technology in terms of adoption, in terms of OpenShift and other technology besides OpenStack.\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nWell, first, like you rightly identified, that eNovance brings some real capability into Red Hat around managing cloud environments, and I think that's something we're asked a lot for our clients about, and so they'll bring real capability of actually managing OpenStack at scale, that we think we can actually scale that capability broadly around the world to our customer base. So we feel very, very good about that. Yes, I think you're right. We do believe that, that same technology team, it's a great group of people, can actually be very, very helpful as well looking at things like OpenShift and our other cloud technologies to adopt. Just for one example, eNovance is a -- was, even before these acquisitions, a significant Inktank partner. So again, it's bringing these technologies together, and their capabilities can help drive more than just our OpenStack offering.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matthew Hedberg (Analysts)】\nWithin the software-defined data center space, you've clearly addressed the compute layer with both RHEL and RHEV and the storage layer with Gluster and now Inktank. But I'm curious, could you make a bigger splash in the networking layer beyond partnerships with Cisco and, say, support of Nicira through OpenStack?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nWell, we are a significant part of the OpenDaylight project as well. So we actually do and are building our own internal capability as we work with our partners in OpenDaylight as well. At this point, we're not ready to talk about products or what those might look like, but we are investing heavily in the technology. And when it's ready, we'll obviously be more involved. That's still well behind in terms of maturity storage or compute.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Heather Bellini (Analysts)】\nI had 2 relatively quick ones. The first one was just that if you could share with us kind of the top 3 items being requested from the OpenStack community that you think could help accelerate the pace of adoption. And then just because we're getting a lot of it from people related to RHEL 7, if you could compare it to other cycles, other releases of RHEL, RHEL 6 or RHEL 5, how fast do you think you see the pace of adoption for people migrating over?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nYes. Well, I'll start. On OpenStack, number one in terms of product feature is installation and management, right, without a doubt on product feature. And then the rest is really around capability, right, which we call consulting. I mean, they're asking for capability on how to manage workflows, process, all of those type things, which is obviously one of the reasons we looked to acquire eNovance. So those would really be the big ones. And I know management sounds like a broad area. I would say, if I had to break that down, installer, and then just through kind of manageability are the biggest features that we hear about. A little bit around HA, but I would say installer and management, and then broadly around capability, around just how do you build, run, manage around it. In terms of RHEL 7, we always like to warn -- recognize, we sell a subscription to RHEL, not to individual versions. So the relative uptake is not material directly to our revenues because a subscriber can decide when and how to upgrade versions. I will say I think this version, because of some of the new features, is likely to move faster in the sense of things like docker and containers that have been well engineered into RHEL 7. So I do think we'll see more of a pickup around cloud deployment models, because I think there's more change in RHEL 7 to address cloud deployments than -- relatively than 5 to 6. So I think it'll be faster. But again, that impacts revenue when people start using more overall. So it's not a direct 6 to 7 having a revenue impact. So we don't track that quite as carefully as you might think.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Karl Keirstead (Analysts)】\nYou mentioned in your comments 2 or 3 times about the strength in the quarter in the cloud revenues and bookings, so I wouldn't mind drilling in a little bit more there. And 2 questions. One is, exactly where are you seeing that? I know you're certified on a whole bunch of cloud providers. Maybe you could offer a little more color where the strength is coming from. And then, Charlie, if there are any metrics you might give us? I think in the last quarter you said that the cloud revenues were at a -- I think a $36 million revenue run rate, up 40%. Maybe you could update those metrics.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nYes. So just in terms of cloud providers, we have now over 50 certified -- Red Hat-certified public cloud providers that are offering RHEL by the hour, by the day on a short-term basis. And that revenue was growing nicely, I would say. That revenue accelerated from what we were -- talked about last quarter. I'll come back with the metrics. But the second piece, we also have a program called the Cloud Access program. So that existing Red Hat customers with paid subscriptions from Red Hat can move their paid subscriptions from their own data centers into a public cloud that has a Cloud Access program. This quarter, we added the Google cloud with the Cloud Access program, so there's another major cloud provider out there with Cloud Access. In terms of the metrics, you're right. The last time we talked about this, what I said was for the fourth quarter, we did about $9 million of cloud revenue annualized, that got to the $36 million number. So your memory is right. All I'll say on this call is that the growth rate has accelerated. And probably the next time, we'll give a metric when we hit the $100 million annualized run rate number. But it's growing nicely. It was definitely one of the reasons why we substantially beat guidance for the quarter.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Joel Fishbein (Analysts)】\nCharlie, just a question. You talked a little bit about linearity comments in the quarter, linearity was better. Can you give us a little bit more color there? And I'm curious to see if any deals closed early or you had any pull-ins there.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nYes. There's no evidence of any pull-ins. But what my commentary was -- again, in terms of the revenue beat, the cloud beat that I just mentioned is certainly part of it. The other piece is the linearity, particularly some big deals in the first month of the quarter certainly helped on daily revenue recognition, and that was a piece of it. But no, I'm not aware of any pull-ins, so to speak.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Brent Thill (Analysts)】\nCharlie, you called out health care. It seems like there's a lot of consolidation, the shift to electronic medical records. Can you give us a sense of how sustainable that strength in your pipeline is as it relates to what you saw in Q1 in health care?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nSo it's interesting because our 4 big verticals have always been telco, financial services, government and then a broad media technology kind of a vertical. And then we have this other group that we call mainstream accounts, and we have kind of grouped health care into mainstream. At some point in time, as it keeps growing, maybe it would be a stand-alone separate vertical. We wouldn't call it part of mainstream. But I think as you point out, health care is going through an information technology change. They have been not on the bleeding edge of adoption, that's for sure, and not like the financial institutions and even government. So I would expect that over time, we're going to see more opportunity for growth in the health care vertical. But I guess that's probably what I'd say about that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Abhey Lamba (Analysts)】\nCharlie, I just want a view. Is it -- your comments about cloud revenues, can you talk a little bit about what are the big drivers behind them and if they can have any cannibalistic impact on your enterprise sales? And also, with this impact of bring your own subscription plans that you offer with some of these cloud providers, can that slow down the growth rate we've seen in that segment as people kind of bring their own subscription to them?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nSure. So just a little bit more on cloud providers. We have seen some data from one of the large cloud providers that indicated that in their case, a majority of the business that they're getting is from customers that have indicated to them they were first-time users of Red Hat, so they're net new to us, and that is a really great statistic to the extent that more and more of this business is net new. In other words, customers that we might not have otherwise touched. It's basically another channel of distribution for us. So we hope that continues. But what's driving it is we have a great brand name built over many years of customer support and a certified ecosystem that -- many of these customers are using their own data centers. So if they have a hybrid cloud environment, they want to know that they have the same certification in a Red Hat-certified public cloud provider. That is what I believe is driving our revenue in the public clouds. The other part -- or question about the Cloud Access program, meaning customers that own Red Hat subscriptions or want to actually run it in a public cloud rather than in their data center, we're totally neutral on that. They can run it wherever they like. The price is no different. The public cloud provider is still going to make some revenue in terms of what they charge to simply run for the compute time, but we're neutral in terms of where the customer runs it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Turits (Analysts)】\nTwo questions. One, can you give us any more details? You talked about a strong sales ramp, but can you give us any metrics on how that compares to last year? And also, the guidance relative to the acquisitions, there are some industry estimates out there that eNovance might have been doing in the 8-figure deal range, over $10 million next year. So is there a shift in terms of how you're recognizing that revenue? Is it going to be write-downs? Or are you exiting any of their businesses? So headcount, sales ramp and then eNovance.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nGood questions, Michael. So on the sales ramp, first of all, since last year, we have added quite a number of additional salespeople, plus we've cross-trained a number of salespeople. And I believe our sales team are feeling very good, and are probably more confident this year than did last year because they've been here longer. So I think we feel good about it. They've been working hard trying to build pipeline for future quarters, and I believe we've done better with that, which is one of the reasons why we have the confidence to raise the revenue guidance range by $30 million. The second question about eNovance, eNovance is a services company and -- manages services company and run a consulting business. So unlike some of the companies that we have acquired that have a subscription business with deferred revenue, this one did not have deferred revenue too that we needed to write down and then sort of start over again. Inktank did -- in fact have a little bit of that. With eNovance, it's an ongoing business that has customers. We will be working hard with them to make the transition to Red Hat. So for the integration process, probably we'll cause a little bit of disruption for a very short period of time as they get on-boarded to Red Hat, and we get going with -- particularly with Red Hat OpenStack, which is what we'll be working hard for them to offer consulting services for.\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nWell, another. Recognize we're also only adding in 8 months, not a full year of revenue because of when we close.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nCorrect.\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nAnd second -- and I can't speak specifically to the eNovance deals, but I can definitely speak to large Red Hat consulting engagements -- 8-figure-type of consulting engagements are generally multi-year. They're rarely ever delivered in one year. So again, we're talking about 8 months of revenue in this year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Brad Reback (Analysts)】\nSo just a quick question on margins. So it looks like this will be the third year in a row where sales and marketing and R&D outgrow revenue. And I understand massive opportunities around some very big things in front of you, but how should we think about that trend continuing and if and when you think it might abate?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nI think the product revenue breakdown that we're now providing may give you some help in thinking about it. Because what you see is -- a very large part of our business that has very consistent growth. The largest part of it obviously is the Linux business at 14%. You should assume that, that is a very healthy business. It's doing quite well. The other business this quarter grew at 45%. You could imagine what a P&L might look like for something with that kind of a growth rate. Obviously, investment there is higher, the sales investment there is higher, and even the R&D as a percentage of revenue is higher. But the growth is really going very strong. So we said at the start of the year that it was our intention to invest, to make some conscious decisions to invest this year, particularly around OpenStack and some of the newer cloud technologies, OpenShift and storage. And I think what you see playing out here in the first quarter is just that. That is what we are doing. I think we are following the strategy that we laid out, and the results thus far have been very encouraging. And hopefully, you're encouraged by the increased guidance we've given as well.\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nJust to emphasize that, the $53 million of the other revenue bucket that we talk about is all subscription revenues. That -- yes, we're investing heavily to get it, but the gross margins look pretty similar to our gross margins elsewhere. When you have an opportunity to have the business growing at 53% with high 90s -- or sorry 45%, sorry, $53 million -- 45% at high 90s gross margins, that's something you should invest pretty heavily in. I would -- without seeing everyone else's private company financials, that's got to be, if it were a standalone company, the second-largest open source company by far. Right? So with those kind of growth rates and those kind of margins, I think it's only prudent for us to double down and invest heavily to grow those businesses as fast as we can.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Zeller (Analysts)】\nAt analyst day, we had some color offered around the cross-selling of products regarding the top 120 deals. Could you update us on that? I believe you gave us a number for all of fiscal '14, but is there any additional color for the current period you could offer?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nYes, one of the comments that we mentioned was that in the top deals of this quarter, 65% of them had other products sold. So the infrastructure-related it would be sort of the base business, and the application development and emerging technologies were the rest. 65% of the top deals had a combined element, and 4 of them were standalone application development and emerging technology deals. So I would say the cross-selling has gotten better. And we have, along the way, continued to add to the portfolio of things that our sales guys have to sell. So I'm looking forward to that continuing to grow and accelerate.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Zeller (Analysts)】\nI guess, just to follow up, there's no further color, though, about moving down the impact there? Or is that an annual metric?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nYou mean give a...\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nThat one's a quarter metric.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nYes, that's a quarter metric. I'm not sure if what you were implying is to give a rolling 12-month metric. I'm not intending to do that, no.\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nYes, the 120 was the 30 -- top 30 deals over the 4 quarters. So we're updating with this quarter. But yes, we don't roll down past the top -- we don't do the analysis like that below the top 30 deals.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nBut you could do it, since we've done that same metric every quarter. You could go back to first quarter of last year, drop off the metric from last year and add on the numbers I've just given and come to a 12-month metric like that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gregg Moskowitz (Analysts)】\nJust a couple of quick questions. How many consultants does eNovance have? And then also, Charlie, was there any change in average contract length versus the prior quarter?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nSure. eNovance brings approximately 110 people with it, and they're not all in consulting. Some are in engineering. In fact, they're the seventh-largest contributor to the upstream OpenStack project, which we think is another big benefit. I'm not sure if we mentioned, but there's at least 40 individuals that have good experience with Ceph, so a big help to the Inktank effort. But there's probably over 60 or 70 who have consulting skills there that will be a big help. To start with, mostly North America and Europe, but the intention will be to use them further than that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nI think the other question was the average contract length.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nThe average contract length was just a shade over 21 months.\n\n---\n\n【質問: S. Kirk Materne (Analysts)】\nJim, just around eNovance, could you talk a little bit about just how much the potential -- I guess shortage of skill -- consulting skills around OpenStack is somewhat of a governor on sort of growth in that technology? And I guess what do you think the combination of eNovance's sort of consultants plus your salespeople working together can do to sort of deal cycles? You think that can compress it pretty significantly? You guys did a similar type of deal with Amentra back in '08. I'm just wondering what you sort of learned from that deal in terms of bringing more consulting expertise into the middleware space?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nWell, I think mainly this will allow us to do more POCs. This -- different technologies than Amentra and middleware -- I don't want to, at this point, say it can compress the time it takes to do a POC, but it certainly will allow us to do substantially more POCs simultaneously. Just one data point on that, we recently had our annual sales president's club, awards club, and Charlie actually asked the question to the salespeople there, \"How many of you could sell incremental OpenStack consulting if we had more people available?\" And I would say at least half the people raised their hands that they could sell more. Now we'll see when we're in the marketplace. But without a doubt, we are constrained in our ability to deliver OpenStack by our lack of enough qualified professional services resources. So without a doubt, this will allow us to do more. Hopefully, it will allow us to speed it up. But most importantly, it will certainly allow us to do more in parallel.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Tim Klasell (Analysts)】\nYes, just a follow-on question with that. With the Amentra acquisition, there was always sort of a training session and they sort of -- professional services sort of led product deals by about a few quarters. Is that something we could -- should expect here? Or because of the complexity, could it be longer?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nI don't think it'll be longer. It is a little bit of a different dynamic. Recognize, typically with middleware deals, the consulting wasn't doing a POC. It was actually working to build applications that run on that application infrastructure. So Amentra was doing -- a fair amount of application development itself is part of that. This will -- is more, at least for starters, will be doing more POCs. So this is our ability to get it up and implement it faster. So it is a different sale and a different dynamic around the professional services upfront. What I don't think we know is once it's up and running, will those customers want to keep resources around to help them with it? I think right now, eNovance has demonstrated most customers do want to keep some of those resources around to help them longer term, which is a little different than Amentra as well. But again, I think this is less about needing to develop the application portfolio like we had to with Amentra that runs on the middleware, much more about doing the POCs, proving it works getting the processes in place for people to be able to run it. So a little bit of a different dynamic.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nTim, I would add the following that I think one of the things that's held back the technology overall is lack of trained individuals globally and customers. And so as we said I think a quarter ago, we have launched a curriculum of 3 or 4 different classes in OpenStack leading to a Red Hat-certified engineer for OpenStack-type of a certification. And I think as you know, we have 50,000 to 60,000 Red Hat-certified engineers out there today certified on RHEL. We -- our goal is to quickly train people globally and have them certified on Red Hat OpenStack.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Tim Klasell (Analysts)】\nOkay, good. And then just a quick question on the middleware. Obviously, it accelerated nicely Q4 to Q1. Were there any particular products inside the EAP that drove that? Or was it pretty broad?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nJust to keep in mind, that product is not just middleware, right? It is application development and emerging technology. So middleware is the largest individual component but has been good growth of all of the technologies, including OpenStack, OpenShift, storage and certainly, middleware.\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nYes. I will say, on the middleware side in particular, we just launched our BPM product. It's one of our fastest product launches ever in terms of uptake of product and size of bookings early on. And the integration product suite -- yes. So Fuse have done extremely well and continue to grow nicely as well.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Steven Ashley (Analysts)】\nI'd just like to go back and just kind of verify something that was said. We talked about strong sales execution. We also talked about expanding sales coverage, and I'm wondering, just trying to parse that, is it just that you have more boots on the street? Or is there an improvement in the execution of the existing sales force? And if there is, any color around that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nSteven, in my view, I think we have both. We definitely have more boots on the street because we've been hiring consistently. But I think our sales guys are more experienced. They're better trained. As I said, the confidence level is high, the enthusiasm is high. I think it's a combination of both. So we're very pleased with their performance in the quarter and looking forward to that continuing.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tom McCallum (Executives)】\nWell, that's all we have time for, operator. Thank you, everyone, for joining us, and we look forward to meeting with a number of you over the next few weeks. Thank you.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you, Laura. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. Both our first quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. \r\nI will now turn the call over to Rodney McMullen, Chief Executive Officer of Kroger.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Cindy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's first quarter 2014 results are Mike Ellis, Kroger's President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Schlotman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\r\nKroger delivered an outstanding first quarter. It is a great start to what we believe will be another exceptional year. Our associates continue to enhance our connection with all customers and achieve key performance measures, which are allowing us to achieve our growth strategy. We also achieved our 42nd consecutive quarter of positive identical supermarket sales, exceeded our goal to slightly expand FIFO operating margin without fuel on a rolling 4-quarter basis, maintained a steady return on invested capital while increasing capital investment. We are achieving synergies from our merger with Harris Teeter. Both Mikes will have more to say about this in a few minutes. And we returned over $1 billion in cash back to our shareholders this quarter through our buyback program.\r\nThe staying power of our Customer 1st strategy and our accelerated growth plan are generating strong momentum. We continue to lower our cost of doing business and to invest those savings both for today's customers and for future growth. Our strong first quarter results set us up to deliver a 12% to 15% net earnings per share growth rate for the year, partly due to the benefit of Harris Teeter, compared to our long-term growth rate of 8% to 11% plus the dividend in both cases.\r\nI'm also pleased to report that we continue to take meaningful steps to restructure and help secure our associates' pension obligations for the future. Through 2 innovative agreements, we plan to move nearly 2,000 associates and retirees to more stable pension plans and 350 associates to a Kroger-sponsored 401(k) plan with a match. We intend to continue looking for opportunities to leverage our strong financial flexibility to safeguard our associates' benefits. We are always looking for opportunities that are good for our associates, good for Kroger and good for our shareholders.\r\nFrom an economy and customer shopping behavior, we are seeing strong positive indicators in shopping behavior. Our customers have exhibited less cautious spending behavior, for example. Consistent with the rise in consumer confidence index in May, our own customer research tells us that more customers perceive the economy to be in recovery. While it is obviously welcome news, the recovery remains fragile, especially for customers on a budget. We intend to keep delivering value and improving our connection with customers across the entire spectrum. Whether through our popular fuel rewards program, our Simple Truth offerings or a more convenient shopping experience, Kroger is uniquely positioned to deliver on this promise in any economic environment. And against this backdrop, an uneven economic recovery, our team's excellent first quarter performance stands out in even greater contrast.\r\nNow I'll turn it over to Mike Ellis to outline our operational performance. Mike?\n\n---\n\nThanks, Rodney. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to congratulate the entire Kroger team for executing our Customer 1st strategy with precision in the first quarter, which is driving growth and improving our perception in the eyes of our customers. We are connecting better with our customers, showing them we care and making sure they have a great shopping experience every time.\r\nKeeping costs down allowed us to invest strategically and increase customer loyalty. During the quarter, we grew our number of loyal households at a much faster rate than total household growth, which also was up for the quarter. We saw inflation increase in the grocery category during the quarter. This, combined with higher inflation in meat, produce and pharmacy, has caused us to adjust our view of inflation for the year. We estimate inflation excluding pharmacy was 1.8% in the first quarter and 2.1% with pharmacy included. We expect it to be higher than originally anticipated for the rest of the year as well. Even with higher inflation, we saw strong tonnage growth during the first quarter. \r\nI'll jump to Harris Teeter. Our merger with Harris Teeter is going extremely well. We are spending time with Harris Teeter and learning a lot about how they connect with customers. Their store standards and fresh foods are world-class, and our cultures are a great fit, which makes our integration work rather easy. We are excited about what we're learning about Harris Teeter's online ordering and store pickup model. It's a program with a lot of promise. \r\nA key driver of sustainable growth is Customer 1st innovation. Each quarter, we are highlighting one or more of our innovations that are improving our connection with customers and growing our market share. This quarter, I will highlight some of the new exciting work of our corporate brands and Kroger technology teams. In corporate brands, a strategic differentiator for Kroger's corporate brand portfolio is our multi-tier offering. It allows us to offer the right price points and product experiences for everyone. In the first quarter, we introduced new branding and packaging for our value products, the good tier of our \"good, better, best\" program. The new design calls out to customers with attractive, uplifting packaging, and the response, so far, has been really terrific. For fresh products, we've replaced Kroger Value with Heritage Farm. The name better reflects the inherent quality of the brand, and we are already seeing positive acceptance from our customers. Corporate brands had a solid first quarter, accelerating company sales growth and representing approximately 26.2% of total units sold and 24.5% of sales dollars, excluding fuel and pharmacy.\r\nKroger technology is our team of technology innovators and inventors. They are implementing a fundamental foundational technology that we can leverage to create the Internet of Things in the retail environment. One tangible example of this is real-time temperature monitoring in our supermarkets. Today, temperature checks are performed manually by our associates, but by using interactive sensors that are connected through an in-store network, we can better ensure the freshest foods by allowing for more frequent, real-time temperature checks of meat, produce, deli and frozen food products. Now we love these kinds of initiatives because they save money and they free up time for our associates to engage with customers. And most importantly, this technology will help improve our already vigorous food safety efforts. We plan to continue leading the adoption of the Internet of Things in our stores.\r\nNow I'll give a brief update on labor negotiations, labor relations. We recently agreed to new contracts in both Atlanta and Southern California, as well as for nonfood associates in Portland, Oregon. We are currently negotiating contracts with the UFCW for store associates in Cincinnati, New Mexico, Toledo and parts of California and an agreement with the Teamsters covering several distribution and manufacturing facilities. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages to provide solid wages, good quality, affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger and the local unions, which represent many of our associates, should have a shared objective: knowing Kroger's business and profitability, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhanced job security for our associates.\r\nNow Mike Schlotman will offer more detail on Kroger's financial results and update our guidance for 2014. Mike?\n\n---\n\nThanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. We exceeded our expectations for the quarter, thanks to our associates performing to deliver growth. We continue to implement our long-term growth strategy, which includes targeting capital to grow our business in new and existing markets, leveraging customer insights to solve varied customer needs through both traditional and digital channels and continuing to deliver shareholder value through our share buyback program and dividend.\r\nWhen we outlined our accelerated growth strategy at our October 2012 investor conference, we also identified the key performance targets for shareholders to measure our progress. I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing the results in each metric. Our first metric is identical supermarket sales without fuel. We are pleased with our first quarter ID sales growth of 4.6%. This strong performance was supported by ID sales growth in every department and every supermarket division. We continue to see outstanding double-digit identical sales growth in our natural foods department. Our produce and general merchandise departments also posted strong ID sales growth, and Kroger's pharmacy department continued its strong performance.\r\nRolling 4 quarters FIFO operating margin on a 52-week basis, excluding fuel and the pension agreements, increased by 12 basis points. This exceeded our commitment to grow the rate slightly over time on a rolling 4 quarters basis. Until we have Harris Teeter in both the current and base years, the expected increase will be higher than our long-term guidance, which is slightly expanding. Over time, we expect our FIFO operating margin growth, excluding fuel, to return to slightly expanding on a rolling 4 quarters basis.\r\nThe third metric is return on invested capital. We reported a return on invested capital on a 52-week rolling 4 quarters basis of 13.5%, which is consistent with ROIC during the same period last year. As we increase capital investments, it will be more difficult to grow ROIC in the near term. However, as these investments mature, we expect them to be accretive to ROIC. As Mike and Rodney already said, our integration with Harris Teeter is well underway, and we're achieving synergies in multiple fronts. One great example is combining insurance programs, which has reduced our annual premiums by $6 million already.\r\nNow I'll share our first quarter 2014 results in more detail. Please note that this is the first period that includes Harris Teeter in Kroger's statement of operations. Year-over-year percentage comparisons are affected as a result. In the first quarter, our net earnings totaled $501 million or $0.98 per diluted share. This includes charges related to the restructuring of certain pension obligations to help stabilize associates' future benefits, as described in yesterday's press release. Excluding the effect of these charges, Kroger's adjusted net earnings were $557 million or $1.09 per diluted share for the first quarter. Net earnings in the same period last year were $481 million or $0.92 per diluted share.\r\nAs Mike Ellis said, we are seeing higher inflation than anticipated. We recorded a $28 million LIFO charge during the quarter compared to a $17 million LIFO charge in the same quarter last year. We are increasing our LIFO estimate for the year to $90 million. Our previous LIFO guidance for the fiscal year was a charge of $55 million. This affects the year by about $0.04. FIFO gross margin increased 1 basis point from the same period last year, excluding retail fuel operations. Strong identical sales and cost controls allowed Kroger to leverage operating expenses as a rate of sales in the first quarter. Operating, general and administrative costs plus rent and depreciation, excluding retail fuel operations and pension agreements, declined 9 basis points as a percent of sales compared to the prior year's first quarter.\r\nNow for retail fuel operations. About half of our supermarkets have fuel centers today. In the first quarter, our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.131 compared to $0.116 in the same quarter last year. Our long-term financial strategy continues to be to maintain our current investment-grade rating, repurchase shares, have an increasing dividend and fund increasing capital investments. Kroger remains committed to achieving a 2 to 2.2 net total debt to EBITDA ratio by mid to late 2015. \r\nKroger took on debt to finance the Harris Teeter merger and realized no incremental EBITDA in fiscal 2013 because the transaction closed late in the fiscal year. This has a material effect on the company's net total debt to EBITDA -- adjusted EBITDA ratio, which is 2.42x compared to 1.85x during the same period last year. As we get a full year of Harris Teeter EBITDA in the calculation, we expect to be closer to 2.2x by the end of the year. Kroger's net total debt is $11.3 billion, an increase of $3.4 billion from a year ago. This is a result of the debt related to the Harris Teeter transaction and Kroger's share repurchase activity.\r\nKroger's strong financial position has allowed the company to return more than $1.9 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends over the last 4 quarters. During the first quarter, Kroger repurchased 25.7 million common shares for a total investment of $1.1 billion. Capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, totaled $709 million for the first quarter compared to $600 million -- $640 million for the same period last year. We continue to expect capital investments to be in the $2.8 billion to $3.0 billion range, including Harris Teeter, for fiscal 2014.\r\nNow I'd like to update our growth objectives for fiscal 2014. Based on our strong first quarter results, we raised and narrowed our adjusted net earnings guidance to a range of $3.19 to $3.27 per diluted share for fiscal 2014. The original guidance was $3.14 to $3.25 per diluted share. The company's long-term net earnings per diluted share growth remains -- our guidance remains at 8% to 11%. Shareholder return will be further enhanced by a dividend expected to increase over time. We raised our identical supermarket sales growth guidance, excluding fuel, to 3% to 4% for fiscal 2014, including Harris Teeter. The original guidance was 2.5% to 3.5%. \r\nAnd now I'll turn it back to Rodney.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Mike. What a terrific start to our year. Our merger with Harris Teeter is going exceptionally well. We are learning a lot from Harris Teeter associates, and our business is performing well. And we're even more excited about Harris Teeter's people and the opportunity today than we were when we first merged. Across our company, our associates' remarkably consistent execution continues to generate consistently remarkable results for our shareholders. We will continue building on this resilient foundation to grow aggressively into the future. \r\nAnd now we look forward to your questions.",

Across our company, our associates' remarkably consistent execution continues to generate consistently remarkable results for our shareholders. We will continue building on this resilient foundation to grow aggressively into the future. \r\nAnd now we look forward to your questions.",
      "transcript_text3": "So a couple of things. Obviously, it's a little hard to tell with Harris Teeter mixed into the numbers, but if I try to back that out and think about x fuel gross margin decline, it looks about what it's been running or maybe just slightly higher than it's been running. And I ask that because I'm curious what you see with regard to inflation today. Is that being passed along fairly quickly? Or given your value position, are you delaying some of that for weeks or maybe even months?\n\n---\n\nYes, breaking it out, you would be correct that without Harris Teeter, the trends would be very similar to what they've been running. From an inflation standpoint, we pass it along, some of it in terms of, obviously, how's the competitive environment going and also, inflation that we think is just a seasonal-type inflation or something that's longer term. And I would say in our ability to pass it through, it's pretty much similar to what it's been running. I don't know, Mike or Mike, anything you want to add to that?\n\n---\n\nNo.\n\n---\n\nNo.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then as a follow-up, when I think about your price investments, right, and you're – I don't know what inning we're in, but how do you think about it now in terms of investing by category, right, because I know you made investments in natural foods. Are there more categories where you need that type of work? Doesn't look like there is. Or is it solely items? And then how do you think about private label, price investments in private label? And when you think about that, do you look at the private label spread versus the brand, or do you actually go out and look at what other retailers are retailing their private label products at?\n\n---\n\nWell, the first question on overall price investment, we're continuing to look at the markets we do business in and deciding where we want to be positioned. Also, we look at categories within the store and try to determine where we want to be priced relative to competition or the market. But private label, there's several ways we look at private label pricing. One would be how it's related to the branded product. And in some cases, it might be priced with the competition in a way that keeps us on our pricing strategy and keeps us relevant. It really depends upon the item and the market.\n\n---\n\nBut do you think -- we're talking about items now. Most of your category adjustments have been made, or do you disagree with that?\n\n---\n\nWe've been through most categories and made some sort of adjustments over the last several years in pricing, but we're still looking at pricing overall and where we're positioned and making decisions on where we want to be.\n\n---\n\nForgive me if you mentioned this. Can you estimate, even if it's just a rough number, what weather's tailwind was on your comps in 1Q?\n\n---\n\nMike?\n\n---\n\nIt's really tough. If you look at the cadence of comps during the first quarter, the first 4 weeks of the quarter were a little bit stronger than the rest of the quarter but not remarkably high. In the second, third and fourth periods, the second and third were affected by the Easter shift. If you kind of normalize Easter between the 2 periods, they were very, very close to one another. So I don't think there was a huge bump in the first quarter as a result of weather. It certainly helped, but it's not what made the 4.6% strong. The second, third and fourth on a combined basis certainly contributed to the results as well.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then as we look at your comps into 2Q, any particular headwinds or tailwinds we should be thinking about? Just a little more color on how things are progressing so far this quarter. Just curious on those lines.\n\n---\n\nYes, we wouldn't see anything unusual versus what it's been running, and we would continue to be slightly above our guidance range in terms of, so far, this quarter and very similar to the first quarter.\n\n---\n\nOne last quick one. It's a bit tricky because of the different days in the quarter and Harris Teeter. I just want to make sure. Your D&A was up 12% year-on-year. Your interest expense was up 14% year-on-year. Are these roughly the growth rates we should be modeling for the rest of the year on a year-on-year basis?\n\n---\n\nFor the year on a year-on-year basis, yes. They will be in that kind of a range because of the Harris Teeter depreciation, as well as the debt we took on for Harris Teeter. And then obviously, next year, we'll return to a more normal level. The other one that's a little different than what we've historically reported is rent as a rate of sales because the large majority of the Harris Teeter stores are leased, not owned like ours, so that affects that line as well, and we break that line out separately.\n\n---\n\nI just wanted to delve a little bit more into the upside in the quarter. So you beat the high end of your guidance, I think, by about a few pennies. Was that all driven by sales upside, or are there other things in play?\n\n---\n\nThe sales piece would be, by far, the biggest driver of the upside.\n\n---\n\nAnd just to clarify, we don't give quarterly guidance, so we only give an annual guidance. So the only thing you can compare it to is what the Street expectations were.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then you also mentioned that you're seeing better signs of a consumer this quarter. What are you seeing in some of your more discretionary areas of the business?\n\n---\n\nWell, we've really seen -- I mean, if you look, it's continuing a good, solid trend. It's always hard to define what's discretionary. But certainly, if you look at what areas people cut back on first, we continue to see strong growth on that across the board. I don't know, Mike, anything you want to add to that?\n\n---\n\nNo, that pretty much sums it up. There's been some mix changes in what people are buying, it looks like. But overall, it's been strong all across the board.\n\n---\n\nThis is actually Lauren Wood on for Ed. Just a quick question. Can you remind us what percent of your stores have a heavier mix of natural and organic selection and where that number could potentially go to? And then also if you see a comp lift when you add -- when you sort of bulk up that offering in your store?\n\n---\n\nWell, I don't know if there's any particular area that has a higher mix of natural foods. We tend to -- it's a strategy for the company to improve our natural foods offering across the country, so any of our new stores or remodels, we try to be aggressive on natural foods positioning and the amount of products we carry. So it's pretty much throughout the country, and it's definitely a strategy of ours, and it's really connecting well with customers right now.\n\n---\n\nAnd it's not always -- pretty much every store has some offering of natural and organic products. What we're finding is it's as much a lifestyle decision as it is a demographic-driven topic. And people of all demographics are choosing a healthier lifestyle, so we actually have the product. And really, I can't think of stores I go into that don't have some. Now the size of the store can dictate how much you have, but it's a broad-appeal product.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then just a quick one. Can you update us on your total MEPP liability?\n\n---\n\nI don't remember what it is off the top of my head. It was in our 10-K and the MD&A. I don't want to guess the number because I'll be guessing wrong. You can follow up with Cindy and I after the call, but it was in the MD&A and our 10-K.\n\n---\n\nI had a housekeeping item first before I got to my bigger question. The ROIC calculation you guys ran in the report, it seems like, and maybe I'm wrong, but basically, Harris Teeter's reflected in the denominator, but the numerator is not pro forma, or is it?\n\n---\n\nOkay. So you are correct, Scott. And you also noticed that we went to 1 decimal place instead of 2 decimal places. So the way that works, it's rolling 4 quarters calculations, so your denominator becomes the average assets at the beginning and the end of the year. So you effectively have half of Harris Teeter's assets in there because of that averaging but only 1 quarter of their EBITDA. We'll get more and more of their assets and more and more of their EBITDA as we go throughout the year. So we did it a couple ways. If you look at it just the way this calculation is, it was about 2 basis points down. If you pro forma Harris Teeter in there for the whole time frame, it was about 2 basis points up. So we just decided that rather than try to confuse it, we're going to call it the 13.5% until the end of the year, and then we'll go back to 2 decimal places, I would think.\n\n---\n\nOkay, perfect. So then the second question is actually more of a strategy question. I mean, you look at the broader food landscape here, and I think you guys just out-comped Whole Foods, if I'm not wrong about that. But on the other side of the equation, you're clearly out-comping Walmart. You have a format now and probably the best high/low operator out there. You got big data. When do we -- and you just bought Harris Teeter, so -- but when do you put this more aggressively on the road? I think you're in 34 states now. When does Kroger really start to drive even more growth? I mean, clearly, you're taking enormous market share where you are, either through more M&A or more aggressively venturing into places you're not.\n\n---\n\nScott, as you know, if you look at our fill-in markets, that is the first part of that, and it's really -- if we look at the returns from that, the higher our market share, the higher our ROIC. So that's really the first phase of that is we're increasingly getting aggressive on fill-in markets. And that's -- we're very pleased with the early result. In terms of new markets, by merging with Harris Teeter, we really view that is going into several new markets. And as I've mentioned in the call, one of the things that we're really excited about is the market share opportunity, growth opportunity that Harris Teeter has, and we will aggressively partner and support growing in several of those markets as well. So from our perspective, that is going on the road with it in the context of where we think we see the highest return with the capital that we've allocated.\n\n---\n\nAny chance we get a bump in the growth rate that you have out there? 8% to 11%, I think you've been exceeding now for a while.\n\n---\n\nWe're not even 2 years in the 8% to 11%, Scott. Let us get comfortable and used to this one for a little bit. But as you know, the key to our growth rate is being sales-led in growing our business and then continuing to executing against our model. So I agree with Mike. Give us a little time, but that's really how we're trying to drive to grow our business.\n\n---\n\nIt's one thing to announce investments in October of '12. It's another thing to begin making those, and then it's another thing again for them to come out of the ground and start generating sales and EBITDA. So there's a lag from when you make the announcement until you get there. Keep in mind, our share buyback in the first quarter is very strong. That was contemplated in our guidance. And we told everybody in October '12 for the first couple, 3 years, 1/3 or half of our growth was going to come from share buyback until our investments started to mature. So we'll have to wait until that tipping point happens, Scott, and see where we are at that point in time.\n\n---\n\nJust on the comps, looking at the numbers that Harris Teeter reported last year, it looks like I mean they actually had some pretty decent comps throughout last year, right up until their third quarter. So I'm kind of wondering if you could give some color on what the impact for Harris Teeter was on your comps.\n\n---\n\nYes, we won't give specifics, and obviously, when we talked in the fourth quarter, we said we would -- we gave guidance with Harris Teeter in it. We were pleased with where Harris Teeter's numbers was. It was consistent with the budget, and that's true for EBITDA as well. But I won't give specifics in terms of how effective the overall total Kroger number other than it wasn't much.\n\n---\n\nOkay, that's helpful. And then I know you obviously gave color on your inflation in the current quarter. What are your expectations on inflation for the whole year or full year?\n\n---\n\nYes, we're kind of expecting in the range where we saw in the first quarter to hold true for the year. I figured inflation was going to come back up again, so I actually flipped to a page in our – you've see me carrying the bluebook around the conferences, Karen. If you look at some interesting things, and without fuel and pharmacy, last year's inflation cadence was 1.7%, 1.6%, 1.5% and 0.8%. And everybody's concerned about inflation right now. In our first quarter, that same metric was 1.8%. Grocery inflation in this year's first quarter was actually lower than grocery inflation in last year's first quarter, and pharmacy and meat and produce are basically in the same range. So this isn't a world we've lived in, and it's not a huge shift, really, from where we were about the same time last year. We're comfortable managing the business in an inflationary environment like we have today and think we're going to see this continue. There's some grain prices out there that are favorable. Milk looks like it's peaked, and it's going to start to come down a little bit, which will help the grocery inflation index because that's where we classify milk when we talk about inflation. So we think it's going to be pretty comparable to where it is today.\n\n---\n\nThe bluebook came in handy. And then just the last question. It looks -- obviously, you gave your dollar amount for the buyback, but it looks like you're done, pretty much done with your authorization. So any comments on that?\n\n---\n\nWe did have -- our expectation in our guidance for the year, contemplated a front-end buyback program. It is somewhat unusual for us to go without any kind of an authorization. What I would say is unless there's -- I wouldn't expect significant incremental buyback activity for the rest of the year.\n\n---\n\nAnd it's really left up to our board on the approval.\n\n---\n\nRight.\n\n---\n\nI'm going to probably talk about something a little bit bigger picture. I was very intrigued by the commentary about pension and specifically that you had some employees, a small number, but some employees shift to a 401(k) plan with matching and also that you moved a much larger group of employees to a different plan. Could you just talk a little bit about kind of what the discussions were, why would somebody move away from a defined benefit plan, and what do you think the prospects are for other people recognizing the value of a 401(k)?\n\n---\n\nYes, there were clearly a couple different moves here, Meredith, both of which came together in the same quarter. The folks in the Pacific Northwest, there were actually 2 separate moves with those folks. They're continuing -- their accrued liability moved into the consolidated UFCW plan that we established a couple years ago. So we took their historical liability that they've already earned into that company-managed UFCW plan. Their future benefits are being accrued in the sound plan, and it's not a sound plan from a financial standpoint, although it's very well-funded. It's called a sound fund in the Pacific Northwest. So that was a group of retail associates. The second move was a group of King Soopers pharmacists who happen to be unionized. Same thing, we moved their obligation, and it was actually through the negotiating process with them where they had the desire to go into our 401(k) plan and be able to manage their investments themselves and accrue those dollars and move them around as they see fit, and that one was really associate-driven at the negotiating table. I will tell you we have some high-level talent dedicated to this effort. In fact, if you remember, a year or so ago, we moved Scott Henderson, who was our Treasurer, and he spent a good chunk of his time, one, he manages our entire pension investment program, both of the -- all 3 of the K plan, the company plan and the UFCW plan, as well as spends a lot of time with our labor negotiators trying to do this. Our view is we're trying to be proactive on this front, not reactive. And we think by being proactive, it's the best thing for our associates, not only for the pension they've already earned but for the pension that they would expect to earn going forward.\n\n---\n\nAnd Scott and Mike working with our labor negotiators and the union, they understand the opportunity and need for this, and this really does improve the quality of the benefits our associates have and secures -- and improves the security of their ultimate benefit. So it's one of the things where the union is also working with us on these, but it's a lot of work and a lot of effort.\n\n---\n\nIt happens slowly. 300 contracts out there.\n\n---\n\nI guess it's fair to say that repeating what you did with the pharmacists may be unusual because they are a unique group of employees.\n\n---\n\nPerhaps. You never know what's going to happen in the negotiation. All I know is the unions and Kroger both have a desire to continue conversations to try to come up with creative solutions to secure -- to help secure the benefits they've already earned and give them a decent benefit accrual going forward as well.\n\n---\n\nThat's great. And then I'm going to just switch gears talking about fuel. You had what looks like a pretty attractive margin on fuel this quarter. And I assume that's because prices were coming flat or coming down. Is that fair to say? And kind of what's your outlook, if you can have an outlook, about fuel prices for the rest of the year? And also, did it contribute to earnings per share in any kind of a meaningful way?\n\n---\n\nWhat we always say about fuel is one thing we'll guarantee, and that is it will be volatile. It was volatile inside the quarter. There were days and weeks where we were not as thrilled with our fuel results, and then there were days and weeks where we're very thrilled with our fuel results. Relative to the retail price per fuel, in quarter 1, on a total company basis, fuel supermarkets and convenience stores combined, the average retail price per gallon last year was $3.524, and this year, it was $3.456, so it was actually a little bit lower on a combined basis between the 2 years. And the cost was actually about the same amount, maybe just a touch amount lower as well. So it's -- and we had very, very strong gallon growth, almost 6% gallon growth.\n\n---\n\nIt helped the quarter, but it wasn't the driver for the quarter by no means. And as you know, we always budget fuel margins kind of the same this year as the prior year. And over time, that always seems to come out pretty close to right. Along the way, there's, as Mike mentioned, quite a bit of volatility.\n\n---\n\nRight, and I'm just going to throw in one more quick question. I think I just didn't hear what was said about pharmacy and what pharmacy did maybe to comps and anything else about pharmacy profitability. I don't know if you made a comment. Some stuff broke up when I was listening to it.\n\n---\n\nYes, I made a comment when I spoke about ID sales for the quarter, that they continued their strong performance both from a script count and the sales count -- sales basis. So good ID sales growth in dollars and scripts.\n\n---\n\nWanted to ask one follow-up on the inflation questions that you've been getting. With meat rising really quite rapidly the last couple months and the quarter coming out okay in gross margin and you guys saying your survey works, looks like your customers are loosening up their pocketbooks. Are you seeing a lot less change in behavior in terms of trading down in proteins and into lower-quality meats and stuff like that? Well, that's really the question. So it's kind of a pass-through, and are you able to pass it through in a sort of more reasonable way than you would 1 or 2 years earlier, when that type of thing happened? And how's the consumer reacting to that?\n\n---\n\nIf you look at meat, specifically, you can clearly see behavior changes as prices increase. So people buying more cube steaks or buying more hamburger, those kind of things, you can clearly see. The comment on the customer overall is very broadly in terms of if you look at what they're doing in total. We feel very good about and we like what we're seeing in terms of customer in total being willing to spend a little bit more.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And I wanted to ask just a follow-up on Harris Teeter. I know you guys do a lot of survey work with customers, and Harris Teeter has a pretty rich loyalty card as well. Have you been able to do any survey work with their customers? And could you reveal what it is you might have heard from them in terms of -- maybe in terms of the 4 keys that you guys go to the market with or that kind of thing? I know at a conference, recently, you said perishable pricing was a focus, for example.\n\n---\n\nIf you look at, obviously, Harris Teeter has done customer research for years. And before, in a couple of markets, we would have our customer research on Harris Teeter just because they were somebody else in the market. Harris Teeter scores incredibly strong on people and products and freshness of products. So when you look at produce, meat, deli department, they score very well. And their associates are very friendly, and that's really their strong suit. And we would expect, when we start doing the combined research that, that's consistent with the research Harris Teeter had done before. We would expect to see the same.\n\n---\n\nAnd where they score well, let's say, in some of that merchandising and maybe customer interaction as well, is that something where that can be integrated into all or parts of Kroger? Or is it just too much of a task given the size differential between the 2 companies?\n\n---\n\nMike Ellis, on his prepared comments, talked about it a little bit. I can tell you that Mike Ellis and the operators are spending quite a bit of time trying to understand exactly how Harris Teeter does that. Mike, you're in the middle of all of that.\n\n---\n\nWell, it's really been fun to have someone who was a competitor that you admire, and now you can actually see what they do, how they do it. But as Rodney mentioned, they've been really strong on some of the matrix, better than us in several markets. So to learn how they do what they do has been actually, really, a lot of fun, and we're integrating some of that into some of our operations today throughout Kroger.\n\n---\n\nI guess turning back to the guidance, given the big buyback upfront, it looks like the year assumes a bit of a change in the margin on a stand-alone basis when factoring in the high LIFO charge. I know you don't like to get into this that much, but can you talk qualitatively about your underlying gross margin, even OG&A assumptions in the back half and any unusual shifts we should be expecting?\n\n---\n\nYes, I wouldn't -- I won't get that granular. The closest I'll come is we did make comments about operating profit, and as we get a full year of Harris Teeter into the numbers, we would expect our operating profit margin to not be the 12 basis point rolling 4 quarters increase we had in the first quarter. But as we get a full year of them in, we would expect it to come closer to the slight increase that we project overall.\n\n---\n\nOkay, that's helpful. And then I think the other thing that, I guess, Kroger's been doing that's a little bit different than other areas in retail is moving towards a few of the larger-format stores, marketplace stores. As you look at general merchandise, which has been shifting online, and you learn from click and collect at Harris Teeter, how are you thinking about the opportunity to offer general merchandise at a broader group of stores with the web? And what are the implications for sales per square foot?\n\n---\n\nWell, all of our large stores have some selection of general merchandise, including apparel, in all of our future plans and remodels that we're working on. And we're really pleased with the results, pleased with sales per square foot and pleased with customers' reaction to the product offering. So it is part of our strategy going forward.\n\n---\n\nAnd for the smaller stores, is there an ability right now to actually have click and collect on general merchandise?\n\n---\n\nNot today. We would expect to take the Harris Teeter click and collect, as Mike mentioned, to other -- to do it in another market. We like what we're seeing there.\n\n---\n\nIt's Jason DeRise. Wanted to ask on natural foods, obviously growing double digits. Can you share what it contributed to the 4.6% comp?\n\n---\n\nWe really wouldn't get into that level of detail in terms of how much of the 4.6% is driven by that. Mike did mention that all departments were positive identicals.\n\n---\n\nAll departments and all geographies.\n\n---\n\nYes. So it's broad-based, so that isn't the thing that's driving it, but obviously a nice growth.\n\n---\n\nAnd when you look at your customer data, do you think that this is a customer who's just entering the category in a more meaningful way now that you're offering it? Or do you think that, perhaps, this is sales that previously were outside of Kroger, at maybe a specialty store, and now that shopper is deciding to do that trip back at Kroger solely?\n\n---\n\nI think it's all of the above. There's been lower prices in a lot of areas in natural foods, so it's bringing new customers to the category. But certainly, people are more health-conscious for their family and the things that they consume. So a lot of our customer insights are driving a lot of the decisions on what we carry and what we put into our stores. And they are – customer is shouting that this is something they're really interested in, so it's a big focus for us.\n\n---\n\nI think it was maybe a year or 2 ago, there was a lot of talk about how Kroger only has half of their customers' grocery spend. How has that trended since the efforts in natural foods and other categories to try to win more of that share?\n\n---\n\nJason, it's a great question, and it's one that if you were in the room, you'd see us smiling at each other because it's pretty similar to what it was because the fortunate part, we keep adding new customers. So if you look at the loyal shoppers that have been loyal for a while, we continue -- that 50% would probably be more like 70% to 75%. Fortunately, we keep growing our customers, so you have new loyal customers coming in. So when you look at the blend of existing loyals and new loyals, it's still around the 50%.\n\n---\n\nYes, and if you look at ID loyal customers, it would be much higher than 50%. But the good news is, is we keep adding people that become loyal below the 50%, so it dilutes the total back down.\n\n---\n\nObviously, natural foods helps on that, but it's really across the whole store that we're picking up that customer, including the fresh departments, produce, meat, deli, bakery, seafood.\n\n---\n\nOkay, great. And I guess I just wanted to see if I can put this in there on Harris Teeter. Would you quantify just the EPS accretion for the quarter just so that we can sanity-check the original guidance on that?\n\n---\n\nYou should assume that our original guidance, our updated guidance would have the same base assumptions for the Harris Teeter contributions to the year. I did mention that Harris Teeter is performing consistent -- a little bit better but not a lot in terms of the analysis that we used when we were working on the merger. So we're pleased with where they're tracking, and it would be consistent with what we shared before.\n\n---\n\nRight on track with what our expectations were.\n\n---\n\nI mean, there's been, in the press, I guess, part of it's your press, but that the Harris Teeter started dropping prices, similar type of press releases that you had seen coming out of other Kroger banners on this. And so that's -- I guess is there anything you could share about how that's gone. Is that what's driven maybe a bit more of the upside response to that, or is that not where the incremental upside has been?\n\n---\n\nYes, it's really very, very early in that process. And what we're doing is the synergies, as we accomplish them, Harris Teeter is taking that money and giving it back to the customers. So it's really giving the customers something back from the merger and some of the savings, and Mike mentioned insurance, for example.\n\n---\n\nLooking again at the pension benefit announcement you made the other day, Mike, I'd like to get a better idea on how the cash flows are going to look on this. You're obviously not going to pay $56 million immediately. But at the same time, how might that be broken up over the next 5 years or so as it moves into the funds, and is there a corresponding offset in your hourly contribution to these plans?\n\n---\n\nA couple questions there. So the $56 million is the after-tax cash we'll have to put in. And as we said, we have up to 5 years to do that. We really haven't decided exactly how we're going to do it. The Kings Sooper pharmacists is a smaller part of that total contribution, and we actually have longer than 5 years to do theirs. But you should expect some plan over the 5 years to do it. What this really does is, technically, what happened is assets and liabilities came attached to their already earned and accrued benefits, and that's what we're shoring up in these plans. Going forward, they will continue to earn benefits. In the pharmacists' case, they'll get a K plan matched. In the Pacific Northwest contract, they'll continue to earn a benefit going forward, and there will be cents per hour accrual for those benefits going forward. So it won't reduce that.\n\n---\n\nSo the $56 million is to shore up the plans, and whatever's negotiated going forward is an additional pennies per hour kind of deal?\n\n---\n\nRight. Now, what we don't have to negotiate and worry about funding going forward is any cents per hour to make up the $56 million because we'll do that separately. So going forward, any portion of an hourly contribution that was there to make up an underfunding in the plan, obviously, we've already negotiated that and walled it off.  So all we have to worry about funding is future benefit accruals, not vested benefit accruals. It'll be separate.\n\n---\n\nAnd announcements of this sort are likely to recur, but it's very difficult to forecast when and how frequent. Is that a fair statement?\n\n---\n\nCan't predict when and how, and it's one of the reasons we had a disclosure of this kind of activity in our outlook section in the 10-K because -- that's why we dedicated some very talented resources to this because we would love to continue to pick off opportunities like this to secure -- to help secure the pension benefits of our associates going forward in some of these underfunded plans, get that out of that fund. If that fund runs into trouble, we know our associates are taken care of because we have them in a fund that we're helping manage. And we do view that what we have is an obligation to do that for them.\n\n---\n\n[indiscernible] has recently indicated that they had seen a pickup in competitive activity, not only, obviously, in their home market with the expansion of Albert Heijn [ph] stores, but also in some U.S. markets. Should we read into that that you, perhaps, have sharpened a little bit your pricing already with Harris Teeter, given that they do compete with the Food Lion stores in a number of markets?\n\n---\n\nYes. As I mentioned before, that's a good assumption, but it's just early in that process.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then just as a follow-up, if I may. I may have missed this, but following the announcement yesterday, have you indicated by how much your multiemployer liability will shrink on the balance sheet?\n\n---\n\nWell, that amount we put in the MD&A is not entirely on our balance sheet. And theoretically, it will be reduced by the $56 million once we fund it. That $56 million will actually now sit as a liability in our balance sheet until we do fund it.\n\n---\n\nJust on your comp guidance, you clearly raised it. First quarter was strong, sounds like second quarter's running strong as well. And you talked about a little bit of a less cautious consumer behavior, which I don't think I've heard you guys say for a while, and upticking inflation. So just curious if there's any conservatism in that 3% to 4% kind of outlook for the rest of the year or any other thing that we should be thinking about getting back to a 3% to 4% range.\n\n---\n\nThe one thing that -- if you look at last year by quarter, the fourth quarter actually was a little better than the trend had been. It wasn't driven by weather, but it was helped by weather. And as we start cycling some of those things, until you actually cycle them, obviously, you don't know where you are. Now we'll always hope that we're a little conservative, but until you get there, it is our best estimate at this point it time. I don't know, Mike or Mike, you want to...\n\n---\n\nI agree completely.\n\n---\n\nI would agree completely also.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And if I can just add another question on natural foods, clearly up strong again. Just curious, if you look at your competition, whether it's discount channel or supermarkets or elsewhere, do you see them investing as much as you are in natural product categories? I mean, I realize Walmart's announced a Wild Oats line. We haven't really seen that show up in stores yet, but do you think some others could start to invest more in natural foods as well? Or what are you seeing versus your competition?\n\n---\n\nWell, there is investment. We're seeing competitive investment in natural foods. For us, we've positioned natural foods in different parts of the store now. You'll find soy milks, almond milks in the regular dairy case and things like that. So we're just trying to answer what the customer wants and have products available at a price they're willing to pay and in a location that they're happy to find them. So but competitively, yes, we've seen a little bit of move but not much.\n\n---\n\nSo I just actually had a bigger picture question. As you look at your overall store base, whether you think you'll see a net increase in competitive openings against you this year or if it's consistent, you think, with last year or maybe offset by closures at weaker chains? Obviously, it doesn't seem to be affecting your comps this quarter, but just curious how you see that playing out this year.\n\n---\n\nYes, it's a good question. And you continue to see a lot of people talk about adding square footage in the space. Some of that square footage is dedicated to what we sell inside of a different format, be it inside of a Dollar General store or a drugstore or something like that. Walmart's obviously building some smaller neighborhood and kind of markets, so that's there. What kind of gets lost is competitors who are closing stores that I would call -- versus a small offering inside of another format, what I would call a destination store. So when you have a destination store close and it's 50,000 or 60,000 square feet and somebody else has added 1,200 square feet, that's really a convenience shop. It's a different kind of competitor. So I think we'll continue to see a lot of square footage open up that sells food. I think overall, the destination kind of square footage is probably flat to slightly down.\n\n---\n\nGot it. That's really helpful. And then just one other quick one. I saw that you recently introduced a premium pet food assortment, which sounds like it could be a nice incremental comp driver for you guys. I was wondering how many stores that's in today and maybe how many you're planning by year end. And then it also sounds like maybe along with that, there's been a change in the receptivity of premium pet food brands distributing to the supermarket channel.\n\n---\n\nYes, we just recently introduced, I'm glad you caught that, a new line of premium pet foods. And it should be in every store in Kroger, I would hope. That is the plan. And sales have started out strong, we're pleased with it. Glad you caught that.\r\nBefore we end today's call, I'd like to share some additional thoughts with our associates listening in today. Earlier this month, we introduced the Taste of Mexico event in all our stores. We hope our associates are enjoying this fun celebration of Mexican food with our customers, including in-store sampling, creative displays and special activities. I know I've enjoyed visiting our stores across the country and seeing the creativity, passion and enthusiasm from our associates for the Taste of Mexico. This special event is the first of a series of celebrations of foods of the world in our stores and runs through June 24. \r\nOur associates' passion for doing good is evident in the way we serve our customers and neighbors in the communities where we live and work every day. This month, we honor our associates' efforts in serving our communities and those in need. We are pleased to recognize in our 2013 annual report 28 associates across the company for their outstanding volunteer service as recipients of The Kroger's 2013 Community Service Award. These women and men give their time and talent on our veterans, feed the homeless, raise money to fight cancer and bringing music to mentally challenged, among many other causes. We are grateful for their commitment. A big heartfelt thank you to all our associates who volunteer. Mike and I are proud of the work you do. You make a big difference for so many others and the communities we call home. Thank you.\r\nThat completes our call today. Thanks for joining us.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: John Heinbockel (Analysts)】\nSo a couple of things. Obviously, it's a little hard to tell with Harris Teeter mixed into the numbers, but if I try to back that out and think about x fuel gross margin decline, it looks about what it's been running or maybe just slightly higher than it's been running. And I ask that because I'm curious what you see with regard to inflation today. Is that being passed along fairly quickly? Or given your value position, are you delaying some of that for weeks or maybe even months?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nYes, breaking it out, you would be correct that without Harris Teeter, the trends would be very similar to what they've been running. From an inflation standpoint, we pass it along, some of it in terms of, obviously, how's the competitive environment going and also, inflation that we think is just a seasonal-type inflation or something that's longer term. And I would say in our ability to pass it through, it's pretty much similar to what it's been running. I don't know, Mike or Mike, anything you want to add to that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ellis (Executives)】\nNo.\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nNo.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Heinbockel (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then as a follow-up, when I think about your price investments, right, and you're – I don't know what inning we're in, but how do you think about it now in terms of investing by category, right, because I know you made investments in natural foods. Are there more categories where you need that type of work? Doesn't look like there is. Or is it solely items? And then how do you think about private label, price investments in private label? And when you think about that, do you look at the private label spread versus the brand, or do you actually go out and look at what other retailers are retailing their private label products at?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nWell, the first question on overall price investment, we're continuing to look at the markets we do business in and deciding where we want to be positioned. Also, we look at categories within the store and try to determine where we want to be priced relative to competition or the market. But private label, there's several ways we look at private label pricing. One would be how it's related to the branded product. And in some cases, it might be priced with the competition in a way that keeps us on our pricing strategy and keeps us relevant. It really depends upon the item and the market.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Heinbockel (Analysts)】\nBut do you think -- we're talking about items now. Most of your category adjustments have been made, or do you disagree with that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nWe've been through most categories and made some sort of adjustments over the last several years in pricing, but we're still looking at pricing overall and where we're positioned and making decisions on where we want to be.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kenneth Goldman (Analysts)】\nForgive me if you mentioned this. Can you estimate, even if it's just a rough number, what weather's tailwind was on your comps in 1Q?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nMike?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nIt's really tough. If you look at the cadence of comps during the first quarter, the first 4 weeks of the quarter were a little bit stronger than the rest of the quarter but not remarkably high. In the second, third and fourth periods, the second and third were affected by the Easter shift. If you kind of normalize Easter between the 2 periods, they were very, very close to one another. So I don't think there was a huge bump in the first quarter as a result of weather. It certainly helped, but it's not what made the 4.6% strong. The second, third and fourth on a combined basis certainly contributed to the results as well.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kenneth Goldman (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then as we look at your comps into 2Q, any particular headwinds or tailwinds we should be thinking about? Just a little more color on how things are progressing so far this quarter. Just curious on those lines.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nYes, we wouldn't see anything unusual versus what it's been running, and we would continue to be slightly above our guidance range in terms of, so far, this quarter and very similar to the first quarter.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kenneth Goldman (Analysts)】\nOne last quick one. It's a bit tricky because of the different days in the quarter and Harris Teeter. I just want to make sure. Your D&A was up 12% year-on-year. Your interest expense was up 14% year-on-year. Are these roughly the growth rates we should be modeling for the rest of the year on a year-on-year basis?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nFor the year on a year-on-year basis, yes. They will be in that kind of a range because of the Harris Teeter depreciation, as well as the debt we took on for Harris Teeter. And then obviously, next year, we'll return to a more normal level. The other one that's a little different than what we've historically reported is rent as a rate of sales because the large majority of the Harris Teeter stores are leased, not owned like ours, so that affects that line as well, and we break that line out separately.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rupesh Parikh (Analysts)】\nI just wanted to delve a little bit more into the upside in the quarter. So you beat the high end of your guidance, I think, by about a few pennies. Was that all driven by sales upside, or are there other things in play?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nThe sales piece would be, by far, the biggest driver of the upside.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ellis (Executives)】\nAnd just to clarify, we don't give quarterly guidance, so we only give an annual guidance. So the only thing you can compare it to is what the Street expectations were.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rupesh Parikh (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then you also mentioned that you're seeing better signs of a consumer this quarter. What are you seeing in some of your more discretionary areas of the business?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nWell, we've really seen -- I mean, if you look, it's continuing a good, solid trend. It's always hard to define what's discretionary. But certainly, if you look at what areas people cut back on first, we continue to see strong growth on that across the board. I don't know, Mike, anything you want to add to that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nNo, that pretty much sums it up. There's been some mix changes in what people are buying, it looks like. But overall, it's been strong all across the board.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Lauren Wood (Analysts)】\nThis is actually Lauren Wood on for Ed. Just a quick question. Can you remind us what percent of your stores have a heavier mix of natural and organic selection and where that number could potentially go to? And then also if you see a comp lift when you add -- when you sort of bulk up that offering in your store?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nWell, I don't know if there's any particular area that has a higher mix of natural foods. We tend to -- it's a strategy for the company to improve our natural foods offering across the country, so any of our new stores or remodels, we try to be aggressive on natural foods positioning and the amount of products we carry. So it's pretty much throughout the country, and it's definitely a strategy of ours, and it's really connecting well with customers right now.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ellis (Executives)】\nAnd it's not always -- pretty much every store has some offering of natural and organic products. What we're finding is it's as much a lifestyle decision as it is a demographic-driven topic. And people of all demographics are choosing a healthier lifestyle, so we actually have the product. And really, I can't think of stores I go into that don't have some. Now the size of the store can dictate how much you have, but it's a broad-appeal product.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Lauren Wood (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then just a quick one. Can you update us on your total MEPP liability?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ellis (Executives)】\nI don't remember what it is off the top of my head. It was in our 10-K and the MD&A. I don't want to guess the number because I'll be guessing wrong. You can follow up with Cindy and I after the call, but it was in the MD&A and our 10-K.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Mushkin (Analysts)】\nI had a housekeeping item first before I got to my bigger question. The ROIC calculation you guys ran in the report, it seems like, and maybe I'm wrong, but basically, Harris Teeter's reflected in the denominator, but the numerator is not pro forma, or is it?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nOkay. So you are correct, Scott. And you also noticed that we went to 1 decimal place instead of 2 decimal places. So the way that works, it's rolling 4 quarters calculations, so your denominator becomes the average assets at the beginning and the end of the year. So you effectively have half of Harris Teeter's assets in there because of that averaging but only 1 quarter of their EBITDA. We'll get more and more of their assets and more and more of their EBITDA as we go throughout the year. So we did it a couple ways. If you look at it just the way this calculation is, it was about 2 basis points down. If you pro forma Harris Teeter in there for the whole time frame, it was about 2 basis points up. So we just decided that rather than try to confuse it, we're going to call it the 13.5% until the end of the year, and then we'll go back to 2 decimal places, I would think.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Mushkin (Analysts)】\nOkay, perfect. So then the second question is actually more of a strategy question. I mean, you look at the broader food landscape here, and I think you guys just out-comped Whole Foods, if I'm not wrong about that. But on the other side of the equation, you're clearly out-comping Walmart. You have a format now and probably the best high/low operator out there. You got big data. When do we -- and you just bought Harris Teeter, so -- but when do you put this more aggressively on the road? I think you're in 34 states now. When does Kroger really start to drive even more growth? I mean, clearly, you're taking enormous market share where you are, either through more M&A or more aggressively venturing into places you're not.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nScott, as you know, if you look at our fill-in markets, that is the first part of that, and it's really -- if we look at the returns from that, the higher our market share, the higher our ROIC. So that's really the first phase of that is we're increasingly getting aggressive on fill-in markets. And that's -- we're very pleased with the early result. In terms of new markets, by merging with Harris Teeter, we really view that is going into several new markets. And as I've mentioned in the call, one of the things that we're really excited about is the market share opportunity, growth opportunity that Harris Teeter has, and we will aggressively partner and support growing in several of those markets as well. So from our perspective, that is going on the road with it in the context of where we think we see the highest return with the capital that we've allocated.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Mushkin (Analysts)】\nAny chance we get a bump in the growth rate that you have out there? 8% to 11%, I think you've been exceeding now for a while.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nWe're not even 2 years in the 8% to 11%, Scott. Let us get comfortable and used to this one for a little bit. But as you know, the key to our growth rate is being sales-led in growing our business and then continuing to executing against our model. So I agree with Mike. Give us a little time, but that's really how we're trying to drive to grow our business.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ellis (Executives)】\nIt's one thing to announce investments in October of '12. It's another thing to begin making those, and then it's another thing again for them to come out of the ground and start generating sales and EBITDA. So there's a lag from when you make the announcement until you get there. Keep in mind, our share buyback in the first quarter is very strong. That was contemplated in our guidance. And we told everybody in October '12 for the first couple, 3 years, 1/3 or half of our growth was going to come from share buyback until our investments started to mature. So we'll have to wait until that tipping point happens, Scott, and see where we are at that point in time.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Karen Short (Analysts)】\nJust on the comps, looking at the numbers that Harris Teeter reported last year, it looks like I mean they actually had some pretty decent comps throughout last year, right up until their third quarter. So I'm kind of wondering if you could give some color on what the impact for Harris Teeter was on your comps.\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nYes, we won't give specifics, and obviously, when we talked in the fourth quarter, we said we would -- we gave guidance with Harris Teeter in it. We were pleased with where Harris Teeter's numbers was. It was consistent with the budget, and that's true for EBITDA as well. But I won't give specifics in terms of how effective the overall total Kroger number other than it wasn't much.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Karen Short (Analysts)】\nOkay, that's helpful. And then I know you obviously gave color on your inflation in the current quarter. What are your expectations on inflation for the whole year or full year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nYes, we're kind of expecting in the range where we saw in the first quarter to hold true for the year. I figured inflation was going to come back up again, so I actually flipped to a page in our – you've see me carrying the bluebook around the conferences, Karen. If you look at some interesting things, and without fuel and pharmacy, last year's inflation cadence was 1.7%, 1.6%, 1.5% and 0.8%. And everybody's concerned about inflation right now. In our first quarter, that same metric was 1.8%. Grocery inflation in this year's first quarter was actually lower than grocery inflation in last year's first quarter, and pharmacy and meat and produce are basically in the same range. So this isn't a world we've lived in, and it's not a huge shift, really, from where we were about the same time last year. We're comfortable managing the business in an inflationary environment like we have today and think we're going to see this continue. There's some grain prices out there that are favorable. Milk looks like it's peaked, and it's going to start to come down a little bit, which will help the grocery inflation index because that's where we classify milk when we talk about inflation. So we think it's going to be pretty comparable to where it is today.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Karen Short (Analysts)】\nThe bluebook came in handy. And then just the last question. It looks -- obviously, you gave your dollar amount for the buyback, but it looks like you're done, pretty much done with your authorization. So any comments on that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nWe did have -- our expectation in our guidance for the year, contemplated a front-end buyback program. It is somewhat unusual for us to go without any kind of an authorization. What I would say is unless there's -- I wouldn't expect significant incremental buyback activity for the rest of the year.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nAnd it's really left up to our board on the approval.\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nRight.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Meredith Adler (Analysts)】\nI'm going to probably talk about something a little bit bigger picture. I was very intrigued by the commentary about pension and specifically that you had some employees, a small number, but some employees shift to a 401(k) plan with matching and also that you moved a much larger group of employees to a different plan. Could you just talk a little bit about kind of what the discussions were, why would somebody move away from a defined benefit plan, and what do you think the prospects are for other people recognizing the value of a 401(k)?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nYes, there were clearly a couple different moves here, Meredith, both of which came together in the same quarter. The folks in the Pacific Northwest, there were actually 2 separate moves with those folks. They're continuing -- their accrued liability moved into the consolidated UFCW plan that we established a couple years ago. So we took their historical liability that they've already earned into that company-managed UFCW plan. Their future benefits are being accrued in the sound plan, and it's not a sound plan from a financial standpoint, although it's very well-funded. It's called a sound fund in the Pacific Northwest. So that was a group of retail associates. The second move was a group of King Soopers pharmacists who happen to be unionized. Same thing, we moved their obligation, and it was actually through the negotiating process with them where they had the desire to go into our 401(k) plan and be able to manage their investments themselves and accrue those dollars and move them around as they see fit, and that one was really associate-driven at the negotiating table. I will tell you we have some high-level talent dedicated to this effort. In fact, if you remember, a year or so ago, we moved Scott Henderson, who was our Treasurer, and he spent a good chunk of his time, one, he manages our entire pension investment program, both of the -- all 3 of the K plan, the company plan and the UFCW plan, as well as spends a lot of time with our labor negotiators trying to do this. Our view is we're trying to be proactive on this front, not reactive. And we think by being proactive, it's the best thing for our associates, not only for the pension they've already earned but for the pension that they would expect to earn going forward.\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nAnd Scott and Mike working with our labor negotiators and the union, they understand the opportunity and need for this, and this really does improve the quality of the benefits our associates have and secures -- and improves the security of their ultimate benefit. So it's one of the things where the union is also working with us on these, but it's a lot of work and a lot of effort.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nIt happens slowly. 300 contracts out there.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Meredith Adler (Analysts)】\nI guess it's fair to say that repeating what you did with the pharmacists may be unusual because they are a unique group of employees.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nPerhaps. You never know what's going to happen in the negotiation. All I know is the unions and Kroger both have a desire to continue conversations to try to come up with creative solutions to secure -- to help secure the benefits they've already earned and give them a decent benefit accrual going forward as well.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Meredith Adler (Analysts)】\nThat's great. And then I'm going to just switch gears talking about fuel. You had what looks like a pretty attractive margin on fuel this quarter. And I assume that's because prices were coming flat or coming down. Is that fair to say? And kind of what's your outlook, if you can have an outlook, about fuel prices for the rest of the year? And also, did it contribute to earnings per share in any kind of a meaningful way?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nWhat we always say about fuel is one thing we'll guarantee, and that is it will be volatile. It was volatile inside the quarter. There were days and weeks where we were not as thrilled with our fuel results, and then there were days and weeks where we're very thrilled with our fuel results. Relative to the retail price per fuel, in quarter 1, on a total company basis, fuel supermarkets and convenience stores combined, the average retail price per gallon last year was $3.524, and this year, it was $3.456, so it was actually a little bit lower on a combined basis between the 2 years. And the cost was actually about the same amount, maybe just a touch amount lower as well. So it's -- and we had very, very strong gallon growth, almost 6% gallon growth.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nIt helped the quarter, but it wasn't the driver for the quarter by no means. And as you know, we always budget fuel margins kind of the same this year as the prior year. And over time, that always seems to come out pretty close to right. Along the way, there's, as Mike mentioned, quite a bit of volatility.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Meredith Adler (Analysts)】\nRight, and I'm just going to throw in one more quick question. I think I just didn't hear what was said about pharmacy and what pharmacy did maybe to comps and anything else about pharmacy profitability. I don't know if you made a comment. Some stuff broke up when I was listening to it.\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nYes, I made a comment when I spoke about ID sales for the quarter, that they continued their strong performance both from a script count and the sales count -- sales basis. So good ID sales growth in dollars and scripts.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Wolf (Analysts)】\nWanted to ask one follow-up on the inflation questions that you've been getting. With meat rising really quite rapidly the last couple months and the quarter coming out okay in gross margin and you guys saying your survey works, looks like your customers are loosening up their pocketbooks. Are you seeing a lot less change in behavior in terms of trading down in proteins and into lower-quality meats and stuff like that? Well, that's really the question. So it's kind of a pass-through, and are you able to pass it through in a sort of more reasonable way than you would 1 or 2 years earlier, when that type of thing happened? And how's the consumer reacting to that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ellis (Executives)】\nIf you look at meat, specifically, you can clearly see behavior changes as prices increase. So people buying more cube steaks or buying more hamburger, those kind of things, you can clearly see. The comment on the customer overall is very broadly in terms of if you look at what they're doing in total. We feel very good about and we like what we're seeing in terms of customer in total being willing to spend a little bit more.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Wolf (Analysts)】\nOkay. And I wanted to ask just a follow-up on Harris Teeter. I know you guys do a lot of survey work with customers, and Harris Teeter has a pretty rich loyalty card as well. Have you been able to do any survey work with their customers? And could you reveal what it is you might have heard from them in terms of -- maybe in terms of the 4 keys that you guys go to the market with or that kind of thing? I know at a conference, recently, you said perishable pricing was a focus, for example.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ellis (Executives)】\nIf you look at, obviously, Harris Teeter has done customer research for years. And before, in a couple of markets, we would have our customer research on Harris Teeter just because they were somebody else in the market. Harris Teeter scores incredibly strong on people and products and freshness of products. So when you look at produce, meat, deli department, they score very well. And their associates are very friendly, and that's really their strong suit. And we would expect, when we start doing the combined research that, that's consistent with the research Harris Teeter had done before. We would expect to see the same.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Wolf (Analysts)】\nAnd where they score well, let's say, in some of that merchandising and maybe customer interaction as well, is that something where that can be integrated into all or parts of Kroger? Or is it just too much of a task given the size differential between the 2 companies?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nMike Ellis, on his prepared comments, talked about it a little bit. I can tell you that Mike Ellis and the operators are spending quite a bit of time trying to understand exactly how Harris Teeter does that. Mike, you're in the middle of all of that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ellis (Executives)】\nWell, it's really been fun to have someone who was a competitor that you admire, and now you can actually see what they do, how they do it. But as Rodney mentioned, they've been really strong on some of the matrix, better than us in several markets. So to learn how they do what they do has been actually, really, a lot of fun, and we're integrating some of that into some of our operations today throughout Kroger.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Stephen Grambling (Analysts)】\nI guess turning back to the guidance, given the big buyback upfront, it looks like the year assumes a bit of a change in the margin on a stand-alone basis when factoring in the high LIFO charge. I know you don't like to get into this that much, but can you talk qualitatively about your underlying gross margin, even OG&A assumptions in the back half and any unusual shifts we should be expecting?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nYes, I wouldn't -- I won't get that granular. The closest I'll come is we did make comments about operating profit, and as we get a full year of Harris Teeter into the numbers, we would expect our operating profit margin to not be the 12 basis point rolling 4 quarters increase we had in the first quarter. But as we get a full year of them in, we would expect it to come closer to the slight increase that we project overall.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Stephen Grambling (Analysts)】\nOkay, that's helpful. And then I think the other thing that, I guess, Kroger's been doing that's a little bit different than other areas in retail is moving towards a few of the larger-format stores, marketplace stores. As you look at general merchandise, which has been shifting online, and you learn from click and collect at Harris Teeter, how are you thinking about the opportunity to offer general merchandise at a broader group of stores with the web? And what are the implications for sales per square foot?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nWell, all of our large stores have some selection of general merchandise, including apparel, in all of our future plans and remodels that we're working on. And we're really pleased with the results, pleased with sales per square foot and pleased with customers' reaction to the product offering. So it is part of our strategy going forward.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Stephen Grambling (Analysts)】\nAnd for the smaller stores, is there an ability right now to actually have click and collect on general merchandise?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nNot today. We would expect to take the Harris Teeter click and collect, as Mike mentioned, to other -- to do it in another market. We like what we're seeing there.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jason DeRise (Analysts)】\nIt's Jason DeRise. Wanted to ask on natural foods, obviously growing double digits. Can you share what it contributed to the 4.6% comp?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nWe really wouldn't get into that level of detail in terms of how much of the 4.6% is driven by that. Mike did mention that all departments were positive identicals.\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nAll departments and all geographies.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nYes. So it's broad-based, so that isn't the thing that's driving it, but obviously a nice growth.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jason DeRise (Analysts)】\nAnd when you look at your customer data, do you think that this is a customer who's just entering the category in a more meaningful way now that you're offering it? Or do you think that, perhaps, this is sales that previously were outside of Kroger, at maybe a specialty store, and now that shopper is deciding to do that trip back at Kroger solely?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nI think it's all of the above. There's been lower prices in a lot of areas in natural foods, so it's bringing new customers to the category. But certainly, people are more health-conscious for their family and the things that they consume. So a lot of our customer insights are driving a lot of the decisions on what we carry and what we put into our stores. And they are – customer is shouting that this is something they're really interested in, so it's a big focus for us.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jason DeRise (Analysts)】\nI think it was maybe a year or 2 ago, there was a lot of talk about how Kroger only has half of their customers' grocery spend. How has that trended since the efforts in natural foods and other categories to try to win more of that share?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nJason, it's a great question, and it's one that if you were in the room, you'd see us smiling at each other because it's pretty similar to what it was because the fortunate part, we keep adding new customers. So if you look at the loyal shoppers that have been loyal for a while, we continue -- that 50% would probably be more like 70% to 75%. Fortunately, we keep growing our customers, so you have new loyal customers coming in. So when you look at the blend of existing loyals and new loyals, it's still around the 50%.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ellis (Executives)】\nYes, and if you look at ID loyal customers, it would be much higher than 50%. But the good news is, is we keep adding people that become loyal below the 50%, so it dilutes the total back down.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nObviously, natural foods helps on that, but it's really across the whole store that we're picking up that customer, including the fresh departments, produce, meat, deli, bakery, seafood.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jason DeRise (Analysts)】\nOkay, great. And I guess I just wanted to see if I can put this in there on Harris Teeter. Would you quantify just the EPS accretion for the quarter just so that we can sanity-check the original guidance on that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nYou should assume that our original guidance, our updated guidance would have the same base assumptions for the Harris Teeter contributions to the year. I did mention that Harris Teeter is performing consistent -- a little bit better but not a lot in terms of the analysis that we used when we were working on the merger. So we're pleased with where they're tracking, and it would be consistent with what we shared before.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ellis (Executives)】\nRight on track with what our expectations were.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jason DeRise (Analysts)】\nI mean, there's been, in the press, I guess, part of it's your press, but that the Harris Teeter started dropping prices, similar type of press releases that you had seen coming out of other Kroger banners on this. And so that's -- I guess is there anything you could share about how that's gone. Is that what's driven maybe a bit more of the upside response to that, or is that not where the incremental upside has been?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nYes, it's really very, very early in that process. And what we're doing is the synergies, as we accomplish them, Harris Teeter is taking that money and giving it back to the customers. So it's really giving the customers something back from the merger and some of the savings, and Mike mentioned insurance, for example.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Cerankosky (Analysts)】\nLooking again at the pension benefit announcement you made the other day, Mike, I'd like to get a better idea on how the cash flows are going to look on this. You're obviously not going to pay $56 million immediately. But at the same time, how might that be broken up over the next 5 years or so as it moves into the funds, and is there a corresponding offset in your hourly contribution to these plans?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nA couple questions there. So the $56 million is the after-tax cash we'll have to put in. And as we said, we have up to 5 years to do that. We really haven't decided exactly how we're going to do it. The Kings Sooper pharmacists is a smaller part of that total contribution, and we actually have longer than 5 years to do theirs. But you should expect some plan over the 5 years to do it. What this really does is, technically, what happened is assets and liabilities came attached to their already earned and accrued benefits, and that's what we're shoring up in these plans. Going forward, they will continue to earn benefits. In the pharmacists' case, they'll get a K plan matched. In the Pacific Northwest contract, they'll continue to earn a benefit going forward, and there will be cents per hour accrual for those benefits going forward. So it won't reduce that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Cerankosky (Analysts)】\nSo the $56 million is to shore up the plans, and whatever's negotiated going forward is an additional pennies per hour kind of deal?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nRight. Now, what we don't have to negotiate and worry about funding going forward is any cents per hour to make up the $56 million because we'll do that separately. So going forward, any portion of an hourly contribution that was there to make up an underfunding in the plan, obviously, we've already negotiated that and walled it off.  So all we have to worry about funding is future benefit accruals, not vested benefit accruals. It'll be separate.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Cerankosky (Analysts)】\nAnd announcements of this sort are likely to recur, but it's very difficult to forecast when and how frequent. Is that a fair statement?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nCan't predict when and how, and it's one of the reasons we had a disclosure of this kind of activity in our outlook section in the 10-K because -- that's why we dedicated some very talented resources to this because we would love to continue to pick off opportunities like this to secure -- to help secure the pension benefits of our associates going forward in some of these underfunded plans, get that out of that fund. If that fund runs into trouble, we know our associates are taken care of because we have them in a fund that we're helping manage. And we do view that what we have is an obligation to do that for them.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\n[indiscernible] has recently indicated that they had seen a pickup in competitive activity, not only, obviously, in their home market with the expansion of Albert Heijn [ph] stores, but also in some U.S. markets. Should we read into that that you, perhaps, have sharpened a little bit your pricing already with Harris Teeter, given that they do compete with the Food Lion stores in a number of markets?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nYes. As I mentioned before, that's a good assumption, but it's just early in that process.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then just as a follow-up, if I may. I may have missed this, but following the announcement yesterday, have you indicated by how much your multiemployer liability will shrink on the balance sheet?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nWell, that amount we put in the MD&A is not entirely on our balance sheet. And theoretically, it will be reduced by the $56 million once we fund it. That $56 million will actually now sit as a liability in our balance sheet until we do fund it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kelly Bania (Analysts)】\nJust on your comp guidance, you clearly raised it. First quarter was strong, sounds like second quarter's running strong as well. And you talked about a little bit of a less cautious consumer behavior, which I don't think I've heard you guys say for a while, and upticking inflation. So just curious if there's any conservatism in that 3% to 4% kind of outlook for the rest of the year or any other thing that we should be thinking about getting back to a 3% to 4% range.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nThe one thing that -- if you look at last year by quarter, the fourth quarter actually was a little better than the trend had been. It wasn't driven by weather, but it was helped by weather. And as we start cycling some of those things, until you actually cycle them, obviously, you don't know where you are. Now we'll always hope that we're a little conservative, but until you get there, it is our best estimate at this point it time. I don't know, Mike or Mike, you want to...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ellis (Executives)】\nI agree completely.\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nI would agree completely also.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kelly Bania (Analysts)】\nGreat. And if I can just add another question on natural foods, clearly up strong again. Just curious, if you look at your competition, whether it's discount channel or supermarkets or elsewhere, do you see them investing as much as you are in natural product categories? I mean, I realize Walmart's announced a Wild Oats line. We haven't really seen that show up in stores yet, but do you think some others could start to invest more in natural foods as well? Or what are you seeing versus your competition?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nWell, there is investment. We're seeing competitive investment in natural foods. For us, we've positioned natural foods in different parts of the store now. You'll find soy milks, almond milks in the regular dairy case and things like that. So we're just trying to answer what the customer wants and have products available at a price they're willing to pay and in a location that they're happy to find them. So but competitively, yes, we've seen a little bit of move but not much.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kate Wendt (Analysts)】\nSo I just actually had a bigger picture question. As you look at your overall store base, whether you think you'll see a net increase in competitive openings against you this year or if it's consistent, you think, with last year or maybe offset by closures at weaker chains? Obviously, it doesn't seem to be affecting your comps this quarter, but just curious how you see that playing out this year.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ellis (Executives)】\nYes, it's a good question. And you continue to see a lot of people talk about adding square footage in the space. Some of that square footage is dedicated to what we sell inside of a different format, be it inside of a Dollar General store or a drugstore or something like that. Walmart's obviously building some smaller neighborhood and kind of markets, so that's there. What kind of gets lost is competitors who are closing stores that I would call -- versus a small offering inside of another format, what I would call a destination store. So when you have a destination store close and it's 50,000 or 60,000 square feet and somebody else has added 1,200 square feet, that's really a convenience shop. It's a different kind of competitor. So I think we'll continue to see a lot of square footage open up that sells food. I think overall, the destination kind of square footage is probably flat to slightly down.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kate Wendt (Analysts)】\nGot it. That's really helpful. And then just one other quick one. I saw that you recently introduced a premium pet food assortment, which sounds like it could be a nice incremental comp driver for you guys. I was wondering how many stores that's in today and maybe how many you're planning by year end. And then it also sounds like maybe along with that, there's been a change in the receptivity of premium pet food brands distributing to the supermarket channel.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nYes, we just recently introduced, I'm glad you caught that, a new line of premium pet foods. And it should be in every store in Kroger, I would hope. That is the plan. And sales have started out strong, we're pleased with it. Glad you caught that.\r\nBefore we end today's call, I'd like to share some additional thoughts with our associates listening in today. Earlier this month, we introduced the Taste of Mexico event in all our stores. We hope our associates are enjoying this fun celebration of Mexican food with our customers, including in-store sampling, creative displays and special activities. I know I've enjoyed visiting our stores across the country and seeing the creativity, passion and enthusiasm from our associates for the Taste of Mexico. This special event is the first of a series of celebrations of foods of the world in our stores and runs through June 24. \r\nOur associates' passion for doing good is evident in the way we serve our customers and neighbors in the communities where we live and work every day. This month, we honor our associates' efforts in serving our communities and those in need. We are pleased to recognize in our 2013 annual report 28 associates across the company for their outstanding volunteer service as recipients of The Kroger's 2013 Community Service Award. These women and men give their time and talent on our veterans, feed the homeless, raise money to fight cancer and bringing music to mentally challenged, among many other causes. We are grateful for their commitment. A big heartfelt thank you to all our associates who volunteer. Mike and I are proud of the work you do. You make a big difference for so many others and the communities we call home. Thank you.\r\nThat completes our call today. Thanks for joining us.",

      "transcript_text1": "Good morning. This is Joyce Brooks, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you for joining today's call for a discussion of McCormick's second quarter financial results and 2014 outlook. We've posted a set of slides to accompany our call at ir.mccormick.com. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, the conference is being recorded.\r\nWith me this morning are Alan Wilson, Chairman, President and CEO, who will begin with comments on the latest financial performance and a business update; and Gordon Stetz, Executive Vice President and CFO, who will provide a more detailed review of second quarter results and our latest financial guidance for 2014. \r\nAs a reminder, today's presentation contains projections and other forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or other factors. As seen on Slide 2, our forward-looking statement also provides information on risk factors that could affect our financial results.\r\nIt is now my pleasure to turn the discussion over to Alan.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Joyce. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Our second quarter results included solid sales growth and strong cash flow, as well as earnings per share that exceeded the outlook that we shared with you in March. While the results varied by region, the overall performance demonstrated progress with McCormick's growth strategies and gives us increased confidence in our ability to deliver our 2014 financial outlook.\r\nWe grew sales 3% in local currency. Both our consumer and industrial businesses contributed to this increase. Growth in our international markets was particularly strong, including incremental sales from WAPC, an acquisition that we completed in May of 2013. We also drove international sales with pricing actions and with higher volume and product mix driven by product innovation, distribution expansion and brand marketing support. In our Americas consumer business, sales declined this quarter due to competitive pressure that began to impact our U.S. results in 2013. Also, we are comparing to robust year-on-year sales growth of 5% in the second quarter of 2013 for our Americas consumer business. We are addressing the competitive environment in this market, and I'll provide an update later in my remarks.  \r\nWe improved gross profit margin in the second quarter by 60 basis points with our Comprehensive Continuous Improvement program, CCI, which is generating cost savings throughout the company. In addition, our industrial business team increased margins in the product portfolio this period. Sales growth, higher gross margin and our diligent expense management led to a mid-single-digit increase in operating income. While the increase in operating income was in line with our expectations for the quarter, we exceeded our earnings per share projection. This was a result of a lower tax rate and our share repurchase activity. \r\nThe reduction in shares outstanding through the first half is tracking at the upper end of our 1% to 2% target for 2014. And we maintained strong cash flow this quarter, with a year-to-date amount of nearly $50 million from year-ago period. Through the first half, we've returned $223 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, a 22% increase from the first half 2013. As Gordon will discuss in more detail, we are reaffirming our fiscal year 2014 outlook to grow sales 3% to 5% and deliver earnings per share in a $3.22 to $3.29 range. \r\nLet's turn to a business update for each of our 2 segments, consumer and industrial. Our consumer segment is meeting the increased demand for flavor when preparing meals at home. And category growth for our 2 primary categories, spices and seasonings and recipe mixes, remained strong. The latest Euromonitor 52-week data shows global sales of spices and herbs up 5.2% and recipe mixes up 3.3%. For McCormick's consumer business, we grew sales 4% in the second quarter and 6% year-to-date. This builds upon our year-on-year sales increase of 5% in the first half of 2013. \r\nHowever, the performance across our various regions was mixed, with the international businesses leading the increase in this most recent quarter. I'll comment first on our top contributor, the Asia/Pacific region; and follow with comments on growth in Europe, Middle East and Africa region, EMEA; and then discuss progress with our actions to improve results in the Americas region.\r\nIn the Asia/Pacific region, the incremental impact of WAPC drove much of the growth, along with the underlying increases in China. For WAPC, it's been 1 year since we completed this acquisition, and we're extremely pleased with the results. The integration has been smooth, and both sales and profit are exceeding our targets for this business. We're just in the early innings of gaining sales synergies between our WAPC bouillon products in central China and McCormick-branded products along the coastal regions. \r\nOur base consumer business in China also achieved double-digit growth this period, continuing the momentum from previous quarters. We have achieved great distribution and consumer acceptance for our new 13-spice blend and our squeeze pouch ketchup. Ketchup is a leading retail item for us in China, and sales of the squeeze pouch are outpacing sales of our bottled ketchup and largely incremental to the category. With this rate of growth and strong performance, China is on track to be our second largest country this year in terms of annual sales when both consumer and industrial businesses are included.\r\nOur sales performance in EMEA was a positive with a 7% increase. In local currency, sales rose 2%, driven by pricing actions. Our volume and product mix were down this period with some initial reaction to the price increase. We're also operating in some difficult retail environments, such as United Kingdom. In these markets, our brand support and product innovation are vital to driving sales. We launched a number of new products in the first half and are supporting these with incremental brand marketing, driving awareness and trial. We're encouraged by the initial response to a number of these items, including Flavour Shots. \r\nLooking ahead to the second half, our team in EMEA has additional products poised for launch that include Vahiné dessert items, Kamis seasonings and Ducros recipe mixes. On Slide 6, we show 2 Schwartz brand items that we'll introduce to U.K. consumers, a no-mess grinder refill pouch and a line of Freshlock herbs. This Freshlock range extends to the U.K., a proven product in France that answers the consumer demand for freshness with a vacuum-sealed package.\r\nLet's turn next to our consumer business in the Americas. In local currency, second quarter sales in this region declined 4%. This decline compared to a strong year-on-year sales increase in local currency of 6% in the second quarter of 2013. As we've discussed, we're addressing some competitive inroads which began to impact our U.S. business in 2013. In this latest period, we had continued pressure from some smaller brands in the marketplace, largely focused on certain product groups within our spices and seasoning category. And while our category share was down, the percentage decline was less than it was in late 2013. We're taking aggressive actions to strengthen our brand equity and to win at retail. These actions are building as we progress through 2014, and we recognize it will take more than 1 or 2 quarters before these actions gain traction and help return to growth in this market. \r\nWhile we'd like to see more rapid results, we're making steady progress in building brand equity. We introduced a number of new products in the first half that included Grill Mates steakhouse burger seasonings, value-sized grinders and Lawry's oven-fry mixes. Distribution targets have been met, and we're pleased with the initial consumption data. We increased brand marketing support in the first half with spice superiority and product quality messages and completed the redesign of our Grill Mates website for this summer's grilling season. Our latest ROI metrics show positive returns in TV, print, PR and digital. This gives us confidence in the efficacy of additional investments that we're making in 2014 to build brand equity. Our new products and brand marketing have led to recent share gains in the recipe mix category. We also had good growth with our Hispanic items and Kitchen Basics brand this quarter. \r\nAs for winning at retail, we've completed the realignment of our sales organization. We're using insights and analytics to set a gold standard for organizing the retail spice set, and we're having a more strategic dialogue with our customers on category management. Spice and seasonings is one of the most profitable categories for the retailer, and these customers want to get it right. We're being aggressive, not only sharing our category management story, but demonstrating our superior quality. Through the first half, these conversations have led to some early wins that include better alignment of retail pricing between private label, McCormick brand and competitive brands. In addition, we've gained new distribution for Lawry's and Simply Asia food brands and won the supply of private label from a competitor. \r\nSo with the progress underway, what should you expect from our Americas consumer business in the second half? First, greater brand support. In the U.S., we're planning an increase of at least $10 million in 2014. Through the first half, the increase has only been $3 million. In the second half, we plan to direct our incremental support toward everyday cooking, new holiday advertising, superiority and quality messages and the launch of FlavorPrint, our personalized recipe engine. \r\nWe have a number of new products entering the marketplace. Our greatest emphasis will be on 2 of these: the first is gluten-free recipe mixes, which had an accelerated launch this past April; and second, McCormick skillet sauces in flavors like fajita with roasted chili garlic and lime. These flavors leverage mainstream family favorites with a bit of a twist. Both the gluten-free items and skillet sauces are designed to build upon our momentum in the recipe mix category. We're already gaining good retail acceptance of these new products and anticipate strong consumer trial and repeat purchases. Again, improved results for our consumer business in the Americas are going to take some time, but we have had initial progress with the actions that we have underway. \r\nI'll turn next to an update on our industrial business. We're pleased with our second quarter results for the industrial business, particularly the significant increase in operating income and operating income margin. We recognize that this performance compares to a year-on-year profit decline in the second quarter of 2013. However, if we look back 2 years to the second quarter of 2012, industrial operating income is up 10%, and the operating income margin at 8.6% in the latest quarter is up 70 basis points from 2 years ago. \r\nAs with the consumer business, the performance varied by region. In the Americas, we grew sales of branded food service products, while sales to other food manufacturers were stable and sales weakness continued with quick service restaurants. The net impact was a decline of 1% in local currency. Heading into the second half, we're encouraged by our innovation pipeline, which is more robust than a year ago. Customers continue to play -- place an emphasis on health and wellness in their innovation. With our foundation in herbs and spices, we believe McCormick is well positioned. \r\n2014 is on track to be another excellent year for our industrial business in EMEA. Excluding any currency impact, we had a strong 12% sales growth this quarter, driven by expanded distribution, new products, particularly with quick service restaurants. The improvement in industrial sales in China continued this quarter, with an 18% increase in local currency. This growth rate compares to weak demand from quick service restaurants in the first quarter of 2013 that related to concerns about avian flu and poultry menu items. Across all 3 regions, we're encouraged by our industrial business outlook for the second half and believe that we'll deliver strong sales and profit growth in 2014. \r\nTo summarize, across all of our businesses, our financial results for the first half have us well on our way toward meeting our 2014 objectives. We have increased confidence in our financial outlook for the year, and we're encouraged by the longer-term prospects for growth at McCormick. We believe that we are well positioned, with leading positions in growing markets, a breadth of products from value priced to premium, flavors for all types of eating occasions, market-leading customers and an expanding geographic presence. \r\nWe are increasingly focused on the alignment of our corporate social responsibility efforts with our business objectives and strategy, recognizing that these efforts are tied to our business success. In the latest Newsweek Green Ranking, McCormick was listed on the top 10 among the 500 U.S. companies included in this assessment of corporate sustainability and environmental performance. We are proud of this recognition and are pursuing opportunities for further improvement. Across the company, we're bringing focus, setting priorities and directing our resources based on McCormick's strategic imperatives with a focus on people, growth and performance. Together, we believe that these imperatives will drive our success and lead to greater value for McCormick's shareholders. Gordon?\n\n---\n\nThanks, Alan, and good morning, everyone. As Alan has described, our second quarter financial results included solid sales growth in many parts of the business, greater-than-expected earnings per share driven by our growth strategies, along with a favorable tax rate and share repurchase activity and excellent cash flow. I'll begin with a closer look at sales and operating income for each segment. Let's start with the consumer business. \r\nAs seen on Slide 12, we grew consumer business sales 4% in local currency. In the second quarter of 2014, sales from WAPC accounted for 6 percentage points of the increase, and higher pricing contributed 3 percentage points. These are offset in part by a 5% decline in volume and product mix. In local currency, this compares to a 5% year-on-year sales increase in the second quarter of 2013, which had no impact from acquisitions. \r\nIn the Americas region, sales were down 4% from the year-ago period in local currency. A 2% increase in pricing following a late 2013 pricing action was offset by lower volume and product mix. In comparison, consumer sales in this region rose 5% year-on-year in the second quarter of 2013 from the second quarter of 2012, an increase mainly attributable to higher volume and product mix. As Alan described, competitive inroads have affected our U.S. consumer business, and we have actions underway to drive performance. Along with early indications of improvement, the category growth remains healthy for spices and seasonings and recipe mixes based on the latest consumption data. To a lesser extent, we had some second quarter impact from a later start to the grilling season and the timing of our trade promotion activity, which will be more skewed toward the second half.\r\nIn Europe, the Middle East and Africa, EMEA, we grew consumer sales 2% in local currency as a result of higher pricing. Volume and product mix declined this quarter due in part to the pricing actions and the difficult retail environment in markets like the U.K. In the preceding quarters, we had better results from this region and have continued to invest in brand marketing and product innovation to drive sales of our brands. We expect to see improved performance with these initiatives and as consumers adjust to higher pricing.\r\nIn local currency, consumer business sales in the Asia/Pacific region rose 76%. The addition of WAPC accounted for 70 percentage points of the growth. We grew sales of the base business 6%, and China led this growth with a 23% sales increase, mainly from new products and expanded distribution. For the Kohinoor brand in India, sales rose slightly in local currency, with significantly higher pricing offset by lower volume and product mix in the second quarter. \r\nOperating income was $86 million for the consumer business, down 2% year-on-year. Higher brand marketing support and an unfavorable business mix reduced operating income this period, offset in part by the favorable impact of higher sales and CCI cost savings. We also had a favorable comparison in the year-ago period to $4 million of transaction costs related to the acquisition of WAPC that were recorded in the second quarter of 2013.\r\nTurning to our industrial business. We grew second quarter sales by 3% in local currency, due to both pricing and higher volume and product mix, as seen on Slide 17. In the Americas region, industrial sales declined 1% in local currency. Demand from quick service restaurants remained weak in this market through the second quarter. We continue to work with our customers to draw restaurant traffic by developing flavors for new menu items. For the second quarter, branded food service sales rose, and sales to food manufacturers were relatively even with the year-ago period.\r\nIn EMEA, our industrial business achieved another quarter of strong sales growth, with a 12% increase in local currency. This follows a similar growth rate in the first quarter of 2014, reflecting continued success with product innovation and distribution gains, largely with quick service restaurants, as well as higher pricing in response to material cost increases. In the second quarter of 2014, we grew industrial business sales in the Asia/Pacific region by 10% in local currency. This is also the same rate of growth we had in the first quarter of 2014. Volume and product mix in China continues to improve as this market recovers from the sharp year-ago decline, as Alan described. \r\nOperating income for the industrial business rose 26% to $36 million, resulting from higher sales, increased margins within the product portfolio and CCI cost savings. While we had difficult results in the year-ago period and a bit of an easy comparison this year, we are pleased with our profit growth and the margin expansion driven by our growth strategy.  \r\nFor the total company, operating income rose 5% as a result of higher sales, improved industrial business product margins and our CCI cost savings. These same factors also improved gross profit margin by 60 basis points. And during the quarter, we funded additional brand marketing programs, with more investment planned in the upcoming quarters. \r\nThe tax rate this period was favorable at 28.5% compared to 29.6% in the year-ago period. The tax rate that we now expect for the fiscal year is approximately 29.5%. This is below our initial estimate for 2014 of 30% to 31% and reflects our latest projection for our mix of business across tax jurisdictions for the fiscal year. Income from unconsolidated operations was up slightly, with strong performance from our joint venture in Mexico. We reported earnings per share of $0.64. This was an 8% increase from $0.59 in the year-ago period and driven by higher operating income, the lower tax rate and lower shares outstanding.\r\nLet's turn next to some highlights for cash flow and the quarter end balance sheet as summarized on Slide 26. Cash flow from operations was $182 million through the first half, up $49 million from the first half of 2013. This improvement included a lower pension contribution in 2014. During this period, we used $126 million of cash to repurchase 1 million shares, and at quarter end, we had $234 million still available on our $400 million authorization. Our balance sheet remains sound, and we are close to our target debt level and well positioned to fund investments to drive growth, including future acquisitions.\r\nTurning to our 2014 outlook. We are reaffirming our projections for sales growth, operating income and earnings per share. At the top line, we still expect to deliver 3% to 5% sales growth on a currency-neutral basis, driven by increased volume, higher pricing and in the first half, the incremental impact of WAPC. As we have indicated, we reached our first year anniversary for this acquisition at the end of May. We continue to expect currency to reduce sales by approximately 1 percentage point in 2014 based on prevailing exchange rates. \r\nWe reaffirm our outlook for growth of 6% to 8% in operating income when compared to $591 million of adjusted operating income in 2013. This projection includes the benefit of CCI cost savings that are expected to reach at least $45 million for 2014 and an increase in brand marketing support of at least $25 million. And we are reaffirming our earnings per share projection of $3.22 to $3.29. \r\nWith the reduction in our tax rate projection to approximately 29.5%, we have greater confidence in reaching the upper end of this range in 2014. Even at 29.5%, the expected 2014 rate is still an increase from the 2013 rate of 26.75%.  On Slide 28, we show the impact of this tax rate variance and $0.01 in special charges on our EPS growth rate. Together, these variances have an unfavorable impact of 4 percentage points on the 2014 projected EPS growth rate.\r\nWith our first half results, we are on our way toward another year of strong cash flow. As many of you know, we adhere to a balanced use of cash and are committed to returning a significant portion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. In 2014, we expect to use nearly $200 million of cash for dividends and through share repurchases to reduce our shares outstanding by 1% to 2% this year. As I conclude my comments, we are confident in our ability to deliver on our 2014 financial objectives and look forward to reporting on our progress in the upcoming quarters.\r\nNow let's turn to your questions, after which, Alan will provide some closing remarks. Operator, we're ready for the first question.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Joyce Brooks (Executives)】\nGood morning. This is Joyce Brooks, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you for joining today's call for a discussion of McCormick's second quarter financial results and 2014 outlook. We've posted a set of slides to accompany our call at ir.mccormick.com. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, the conference is being recorded.\r\nWith me this morning are Alan Wilson, Chairman, President and CEO, who will begin with comments on the latest financial performance and a business update; and Gordon Stetz, Executive Vice President and CFO, who will provide a more detailed review of second quarter results and our latest financial guidance for 2014. \r\nAs a reminder, today's presentation contains projections and other forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or other factors. As seen on Slide 2, our forward-looking statement also provides information on risk factors that could affect our financial results.\r\nIt is now my pleasure to turn the discussion over to Alan.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Alan Wilson (Executives)】\nThank you, Joyce. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Our second quarter results included solid sales growth and strong cash flow, as well as earnings per share that exceeded the outlook that we shared with you in March. While the results varied by region, the overall performance demonstrated progress with McCormick's growth strategies and gives us increased confidence in our ability to deliver our 2014 financial outlook.\r\nWe grew sales 3% in local currency. Both our consumer and industrial businesses contributed to this increase. Growth in our international markets was particularly strong, including incremental sales from WAPC, an acquisition that we completed in May of 2013. We also drove international sales with pricing actions and with higher volume and product mix driven by product innovation, distribution expansion and brand marketing support. In our Americas consumer business, sales declined this quarter due to competitive pressure that began to impact our U.S. results in 2013. Also, we are comparing to robust year-on-year sales growth of 5% in the second quarter of 2013 for our Americas consumer business. We are addressing the competitive environment in this market, and I'll provide an update later in my remarks.  \r\nWe improved gross profit margin in the second quarter by 60 basis points with our Comprehensive Continuous Improvement program, CCI, which is generating cost savings throughout the company. In addition, our industrial business team increased margins in the product portfolio this period. Sales growth, higher gross margin and our diligent expense management led to a mid-single-digit increase in operating income. While the increase in operating income was in line with our expectations for the quarter, we exceeded our earnings per share projection. This was a result of a lower tax rate and our share repurchase activity. \r\nThe reduction in shares outstanding through the first half is tracking at the upper end of our 1% to 2% target for 2014. And we maintained strong cash flow this quarter, with a year-to-date amount of nearly $50 million from year-ago period. Through the first half, we've returned $223 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, a 22% increase from the first half 2013. As Gordon will discuss in more detail, we are reaffirming our fiscal year 2014 outlook to grow sales 3% to 5% and deliver earnings per share in a $3.22 to $3.29 range. \r\nLet's turn to a business update for each of our 2 segments, consumer and industrial. Our consumer segment is meeting the increased demand for flavor when preparing meals at home. And category growth for our 2 primary categories, spices and seasonings and recipe mixes, remained strong. The latest Euromonitor 52-week data shows global sales of spices and herbs up 5.2% and recipe mixes up 3.3%. For McCormick's consumer business, we grew sales 4% in the second quarter and 6% year-to-date. This builds upon our year-on-year sales increase of 5% in the first half of 2013. \r\nHowever, the performance across our various regions was mixed, with the international businesses leading the increase in this most recent quarter. I'll comment first on our top contributor, the Asia/Pacific region; and follow with comments on growth in Europe, Middle East and Africa region, EMEA; and then discuss progress with our actions to improve results in the Americas region.\r\nIn the Asia/Pacific region, the incremental impact of WAPC drove much of the growth, along with the underlying increases in China. For WAPC, it's been 1 year since we completed this acquisition, and we're extremely pleased with the results. The integration has been smooth, and both sales and profit are exceeding our targets for this business. We're just in the early innings of gaining sales synergies between our WAPC bouillon products in central China and McCormick-branded products along the coastal regions. \r\nOur base consumer business in China also achieved double-digit growth this period, continuing the momentum from previous quarters. We have achieved great distribution and consumer acceptance for our new 13-spice blend and our squeeze pouch ketchup. Ketchup is a leading retail item for us in China, and sales of the squeeze pouch are outpacing sales of our bottled ketchup and largely incremental to the category. With this rate of growth and strong performance, China is on track to be our second largest country this year in terms of annual sales when both consumer and industrial businesses are included.\r\nOur sales performance in EMEA was a positive with a 7% increase. In local currency, sales rose 2%, driven by pricing actions. Our volume and product mix were down this period with some initial reaction to the price increase. We're also operating in some difficult retail environments, such as United Kingdom. In these markets, our brand support and product innovation are vital to driving sales. We launched a number of new products in the first half and are supporting these with incremental brand marketing, driving awareness and trial. We're encouraged by the initial response to a number of these items, including Flavour Shots. \r\nLooking ahead to the second half, our team in EMEA has additional products poised for launch that include Vahiné dessert items, Kamis seasonings and Ducros recipe mixes. On Slide 6, we show 2 Schwartz brand items that we'll introduce to U.K. consumers, a no-mess grinder refill pouch and a line of Freshlock herbs. This Freshlock range extends to the U.K., a proven product in France that answers the consumer demand for freshness with a vacuum-sealed package.\r\nLet's turn next to our consumer business in the Americas. In local currency, second quarter sales in this region declined 4%. This decline compared to a strong year-on-year sales increase in local currency of 6% in the second quarter of 2013. As we've discussed, we're addressing some competitive inroads which began to impact our U.S. business in 2013. In this latest period, we had continued pressure from some smaller brands in the marketplace, largely focused on certain product groups within our spices and seasoning category. And while our category share was down, the percentage decline was less than it was in late 2013. We're taking aggressive actions to strengthen our brand equity and to win at retail. These actions are building as we progress through 2014, and we recognize it will take more than 1 or 2 quarters before these actions gain traction and help return to growth in this market. \r\nWhile we'd like to see more rapid results, we're making steady progress in building brand equity. We introduced a number of new products in the first half that included Grill Mates steakhouse burger seasonings, value-sized grinders and Lawry's oven-fry mixes. Distribution targets have been met, and we're pleased with the initial consumption data. We increased brand marketing support in the first half with spice superiority and product quality messages and completed the redesign of our Grill Mates website for this summer's grilling season. Our latest ROI metrics show positive returns in TV, print, PR and digital. This gives us confidence in the efficacy of additional investments that we're making in 2014 to build brand equity. Our new products and brand marketing have led to recent share gains in the recipe mix category. We also had good growth with our Hispanic items and Kitchen Basics brand this quarter. \r\nAs for winning at retail, we've completed the realignment of our sales organization. We're using insights and analytics to set a gold standard for organizing the retail spice set, and we're having a more strategic dialogue with our customers on category management. Spice and seasonings is one of the most profitable categories for the retailer, and these customers want to get it right. We're being aggressive, not only sharing our category management story, but demonstrating our superior quality. Through the first half, these conversations have led to some early wins that include better alignment of retail pricing between private label, McCormick brand and competitive brands. In addition, we've gained new distribution for Lawry's and Simply Asia food brands and won the supply of private label from a competitor. \r\nSo with the progress underway, what should you expect from our Americas consumer business in the second half? First, greater brand support. In the U.S., we're planning an increase of at least $10 million in 2014. Through the first half, the increase has only been $3 million. In the second half, we plan to direct our incremental support toward everyday cooking, new holiday advertising, superiority and quality messages and the launch of FlavorPrint, our personalized recipe engine. \r\nWe have a number of new products entering the marketplace. Our greatest emphasis will be on 2 of these: the first is gluten-free recipe mixes, which had an accelerated launch this past April; and second, McCormick skillet sauces in flavors like fajita with roasted chili garlic and lime. These flavors leverage mainstream family favorites with a bit of a twist. Both the gluten-free items and skillet sauces are designed to build upon our momentum in the recipe mix category. We're already gaining good retail acceptance of these new products and anticipate strong consumer trial and repeat purchases. Again, improved results for our consumer business in the Americas are going to take some time, but we have had initial progress with the actions that we have underway. \r\nI'll turn next to an update on our industrial business. We're pleased with our second quarter results for the industrial business, particularly the significant increase in operating income and operating income margin. We recognize that this performance compares to a year-on-year profit decline in the second quarter of 2013. However, if we look back 2 years to the second quarter of 2012, industrial operating income is up 10%, and the operating income margin at 8.6% in the latest quarter is up 70 basis points from 2 years ago. \r\nAs with the consumer business, the performance varied by region. In the Americas, we grew sales of branded food service products, while sales to other food manufacturers were stable and sales weakness continued with quick service restaurants. The net impact was a decline of 1% in local currency. Heading into the second half, we're encouraged by our innovation pipeline, which is more robust than a year ago. Customers continue to play -- place an emphasis on health and wellness in their innovation. With our foundation in herbs and spices, we believe McCormick is well positioned. \r\n2014 is on track to be another excellent year for our industrial business in EMEA. Excluding any currency impact, we had a strong 12% sales growth this quarter, driven by expanded distribution, new products, particularly with quick service restaurants. The improvement in industrial sales in China continued this quarter, with an 18% increase in local currency. This growth rate compares to weak demand from quick service restaurants in the first quarter of 2013 that related to concerns about avian flu and poultry menu items. Across all 3 regions, we're encouraged by our industrial business outlook for the second half and believe that we'll deliver strong sales and profit growth in 2014. \r\nTo summarize, across all of our businesses, our financial results for the first half have us well on our way toward meeting our 2014 objectives. We have increased confidence in our financial outlook for the year, and we're encouraged by the longer-term prospects for growth at McCormick. We believe that we are well positioned, with leading positions in growing markets, a breadth of products from value priced to premium, flavors for all types of eating occasions, market-leading customers and an expanding geographic presence. \r\nWe are increasingly focused on the alignment of our corporate social responsibility efforts with our business objectives and strategy, recognizing that these efforts are tied to our business success. In the latest Newsweek Green Ranking, McCormick was listed on the top 10 among the 500 U.S. companies included in this assessment of corporate sustainability and environmental performance. We are proud of this recognition and are pursuing opportunities for further improvement. Across the company, we're bringing focus, setting priorities and directing our resources based on McCormick's strategic imperatives with a focus on people, growth and performance. Together, we believe that these imperatives will drive our success and lead to greater value for McCormick's shareholders. Gordon?\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Gordon Stetz (Executives)】\nThanks, Alan, and good morning, everyone. As Alan has described, our second quarter financial results included solid sales growth in many parts of the business, greater-than-expected earnings per share driven by our growth strategies, along with a favorable tax rate and share repurchase activity and excellent cash flow. I'll begin with a closer look at sales and operating income for each segment. Let's start with the consumer business. \r\nAs seen on Slide 12, we grew consumer business sales 4% in local currency. In the second quarter of 2014, sales from WAPC accounted for 6 percentage points of the increase, and higher pricing contributed 3 percentage points. These are offset in part by a 5% decline in volume and product mix. In local currency, this compares to a 5% year-on-year sales increase in the second quarter of 2013, which had no impact from acquisitions. \r\nIn the Americas region, sales were down 4% from the year-ago period in local currency. A 2% increase in pricing following a late 2013 pricing action was offset by lower volume and product mix. In comparison, consumer sales in this region rose 5% year-on-year in the second quarter of 2013 from the second quarter of 2012, an increase mainly attributable to higher volume and product mix. As Alan described, competitive inroads have affected our U.S. consumer business, and we have actions underway to drive performance. Along with early indications of improvement, the category growth remains healthy for spices and seasonings and recipe mixes based on the latest consumption data. To a lesser extent, we had some second quarter impact from a later start to the grilling season and the timing of our trade promotion activity, which will be more skewed toward the second half.\r\nIn Europe, the Middle East and Africa, EMEA, we grew consumer sales 2% in local currency as a result of higher pricing. Volume and product mix declined this quarter due in part to the pricing actions and the difficult retail environment in markets like the U.K. In the preceding quarters, we had better results from this region and have continued to invest in brand marketing and product innovation to drive sales of our brands. We expect to see improved performance with these initiatives and as consumers adjust to higher pricing.\r\nIn local currency, consumer business sales in the Asia/Pacific region rose 76%. The addition of WAPC accounted for 70 percentage points of the growth. We grew sales of the base business 6%, and China led this growth with a 23% sales increase, mainly from new products and expanded distribution. For the Kohinoor brand in India, sales rose slightly in local currency, with significantly higher pricing offset by lower volume and product mix in the second quarter. \r\nOperating income was $86 million for the consumer business, down 2% year-on-year. Higher brand marketing support and an unfavorable business mix reduced operating income this period, offset in part by the favorable impact of higher sales and CCI cost savings. We also had a favorable comparison in the year-ago period to $4 million of transaction costs related to the acquisition of WAPC that were recorded in the second quarter of 2013.\r\nTurning to our industrial business. We grew second quarter sales by 3% in local currency, due to both pricing and higher volume and product mix, as seen on Slide 17. In the Americas region, industrial sales declined 1% in local currency. Demand from quick service restaurants remained weak in this market through the second quarter. We continue to work with our customers to draw restaurant traffic by developing flavors for new menu items. For the second quarter, branded food service sales rose, and sales to food manufacturers were relatively even with the year-ago period.\r\nIn EMEA, our industrial business achieved another quarter of strong sales growth, with a 12% increase in local currency. This follows a similar growth rate in the first quarter of 2014, reflecting continued success with product innovation and distribution gains, largely with quick service restaurants, as well as higher pricing in response to material cost increases. In the second quarter of 2014, we grew industrial business sales in the Asia/Pacific region by 10% in local currency. This is also the same rate of growth we had in the first quarter of 2014. Volume and product mix in China continues to improve as this market recovers from the sharp year-ago decline, as Alan described. \r\nOperating income for the industrial business rose 26% to $36 million, resulting from higher sales, increased margins within the product portfolio and CCI cost savings. While we had difficult results in the year-ago period and a bit of an easy comparison this year, we are pleased with our profit growth and the margin expansion driven by our growth strategy.  \r\nFor the total company, operating income rose 5% as a result of higher sales, improved industrial business product margins and our CCI cost savings. These same factors also improved gross profit margin by 60 basis points. And during the quarter, we funded additional brand marketing programs, with more investment planned in the upcoming quarters. \r\nThe tax rate this period was favorable at 28.5% compared to 29.6% in the year-ago period. The tax rate that we now expect for the fiscal year is approximately 29.5%. This is below our initial estimate for 2014 of 30% to 31% and reflects our latest projection for our mix of business across tax jurisdictions for the fiscal year. Income from unconsolidated operations was up slightly, with strong performance from our joint venture in Mexico. We reported earnings per share of $0.64. This was an 8% increase from $0.59 in the year-ago period and driven by higher operating income, the lower tax rate and lower shares outstanding.\r\nLet's turn next to some highlights for cash flow and the quarter end balance sheet as summarized on Slide 26. Cash flow from operations was $182 million through the first half, up $49 million from the first half of 2013. This improvement included a lower pension contribution in 2014. During this period, we used $126 million of cash to repurchase 1 million shares, and at quarter end, we had $234 million still available on our $400 million authorization. Our balance sheet remains sound, and we are close to our target debt level and well positioned to fund investments to drive growth, including future acquisitions.\r\nTurning to our 2014 outlook. We are reaffirming our projections for sales growth, operating income and earnings per share. At the top line, we still expect to deliver 3% to 5% sales growth on a currency-neutral basis, driven by increased volume, higher pricing and in the first half, the incremental impact of WAPC. As we have indicated, we reached our first year anniversary for this acquisition at the end of May. We continue to expect currency to reduce sales by approximately 1 percentage point in 2014 based on prevailing exchange rates. \r\nWe reaffirm our outlook for growth of 6% to 8% in operating income when compared to $591 million of adjusted operating income in 2013. This projection includes the benefit of CCI cost savings that are expected to reach at least $45 million for 2014 and an increase in brand marketing support of at least $25 million. And we are reaffirming our earnings per share projection of $3.22 to $3.29. \r\nWith the reduction in our tax rate projection to approximately 29.5%, we have greater confidence in reaching the upper end of this range in 2014. Even at 29.5%, the expected 2014 rate is still an increase from the 2013 rate of 26.75%.  On Slide 28, we show the impact of this tax rate variance and $0.01 in special charges on our EPS growth rate. Together, these variances have an unfavorable impact of 4 percentage points on the 2014 projected EPS growth rate.\r\nWith our first half results, we are on our way toward another year of strong cash flow. As many of you know, we adhere to a balanced use of cash and are committed to returning a significant portion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. In 2014, we expect to use nearly $200 million of cash for dividends and through share repurchases to reduce our shares outstanding by 1% to 2% this year. As I conclude my comments, we are confident in our ability to deliver on our 2014 financial objectives and look forward to reporting on our progress in the upcoming quarters.\r\nNow let's turn to your questions, after which, Alan will provide some closing remarks. Operator, we're ready for the first question.",
      "transcript_text3": "Alan, your Nielsen numbers, they showed a decline but not to the degree you reported domestically. So I guess I'm curious if you could help us understand that disparity a bit. And Gordon talked about a later grilling season, so I'm curious if it was a shipment timing issue or maybe channel issue or non-measured, you're maybe doing a little bit less impressively than measured. I'm just trying to, I guess, understand that dynamic a bit better.\n\n---\n\nYes. It's pretty hard to calibrate all the different sources of information. We use IRI, and we have a custom database. So from our outlook -- I'll talk more generally without trying to get into specifics of the data as to what's happening. From our view, what we saw was less of a decline in share than we saw in the fourth quarter of last year. Partly, we think that some of our efforts at retail are starting to have an impact. It's going to be -- it's going to take some time, and we expect that we will win. But in terms of getting to the data specifics, it's really hard for us to get. There was a later start to the grilling season. The weather was not favorable for grilling. We're expecting a pretty good grilling season as we go through the summer, and we're planning to extend it through the third quarter and even through Labor Day and to tailgate season, so we're pretty encouraged. Most of our new products are going to hit in the second half of the year, and we're pretty excited about those as well.\n\n---\n\nAnd then if I can ask one more, Gordon, we're seeing a good number of packaged food companies thinking about rationalizing production and overhead in the U.S. Even Mills, right, which has an ongoing cost savings program, just like yours, I think, is going this route. So curious if you guys are considering going down this road or if you're comfortable with your cost structure, I guess, at the moment.\n\n---\n\nWell, you always need to challenge yourself to be competitive, and that's the whole nature of the CCI environment. And the idea behind the program, as you know, Ken, when we developed it a few years ago, was to keep looking at those opportunities on a go-forward basis, and you can never stop. I will calibrate it a bit, though, in that if you recall, a few years ago, in the North American businesses, in particular, we did some significant rationalization, in the -- in particular, in the consumer side, where we did reduce our number of plants. And so therefore, our footprint is pretty consolidated here in the U.S. in our consumer business. In the industrial side, our plants tend to be more specialized for customer service needs. But having said that, we constantly look at our network and the best way to organize ourselves, so we still look for these opportunities all the time.\n\n---\n\nAnd we have adjusted our SG&A and headcount for the volumes that we've seen and we've been -- both in manufacturing as well as in our headquarters.\n\n---\n\nCan I just ask for a little bit more granularity on the share losses? Could you remind us, is it concentrated in a particular region with a particular type of retailer? Is it private label you're losing share to or value brands or premium brands? And do you know which consumer segments you're losing share to? Is it the Hispanic group? Is it millennial consumers or older consumers? Just a little bit more detail on how you're seeing the development of those share changes.\n\n---\n\nYes. And it's changed a bit in the more recent periods. Private label is more flat. Most of the -- we have one larger branded competitor, and that competitor is relatively flat. And so what we're seeing is very small inroads from a number of small and regional competitors that are gaining 1/10 of a share point or point -- 2/10 of a share point. Their overall share base is still less than 1% or 2% I think, as we -- I looked at the most recent period and of the 10 brands that gained share, no one, other than McCormick -- by the way, our core A to Z, actually gained a slight bit in the most recent period. But nobody had more than 2% share in all that. So it's pretty -- what's happening is the consumer and the retailers are pretty fragmenting. And some of that's on the value end, some of that's on the premium end. We compete across both of those segments, and so we've got different tactics that we're using to compete with the superpremium, in some cases, even bagged spices that are finding their way into measured markets and then on the premium end with what we're doing with our innovation.\n\n---\n\nGordon, I was trying to reconcile the guidance. With the operating income being up 6% to 8%, the tax rate down, share count down, we're getting a number that seems to go beyond the high end of your range for EPS at $3.29. I just want to make sure I'm doing this right. So is the 6% to 8% -- is there -- are we supposed to reduce that for currency? Or is that 6% to 8% absorbing the currency?\n\n---\n\nIt's getting pressure from currency, I'd say that. But I don't want to be more specific than that. Obviously, currency is going to put some pressure on that number. The other thing on the operating income line, as you heard Alan talk about, is we are supporting our business in the back half of the year. We've spent year-to-date $11 million in advertising and promotion, and we've said [ph] at least $25 million in the back half. So that's going to be a factor impacting those numbers as well. And then just to help calibrate the tax rate, that tax rate -- unfavorability, as you know, is very much weighted towards the back half of the year, so that's also something else that needs to be factored in because that all starts to occur. I think our last year's rate for the second half was a little north of 25%, and at 29.5%, that's quite a drag on the EPS in the back half of the year.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Gordon, I get that. But just to be more clear, your sales guidance is in constant currency so I'm not -- I know what to do with that. And you have 1% hit for ForEx on the top line. Is it also a 1% hit on the operating income line? Does it flow through? And is the 6% to 8% x currency or not?\n\n---\n\nThe 6% to 8% is not x currency. That's all in, so it would reflect whatever pressure that currency drops through to the bottom line. And generally, it's not a one-for-one relationship, but there's certainly a negative hit on that 6% to 8% from currency.\n\n---\n\nAll right. I got it now. So last question, in fourth quarter, that's your biggest quarter, especially in the U.S., for seasonal reasons. Are your market share -- do you expect your market share to be down again in fourth quarter in the U.S., Alan? Or are you going to have lapped those market share losses by that time and therefore, we can expect kind of a normal growth pattern for fourth quarter?\n\n---\n\nWe expect to stabilize and start to grow our share. But certainly, in the fourth quarter, we think we will have lapped the impact in share from last year.\n\n---\n\nOkay. So you would expect like a pretty good seasonal time period this year? Have you got initial sell-in already for how much inventory your customers are looking at for the seasons?\n\n---\n\nYes. We're selling in right now. The display programs are the easiest things for us to track. The turn orders are a little more difficult. But we're encouraged by what we're seeing with our holiday sale-in at this point.\n\n---\n\nI want to go back to the question that Rob was asking a moment ago about the guidance. I'm going to try it a different way though. So if all the numbers are unchanged, except we have a nice lower tax rate, 100 basis points of tax, if I go from the midpoint of what the prior range was to the new one, that's worth like $0.05. So the other observation is, is that the segment results are coming in, especially this quarter, weaker than what we had modeled. So is it fair to say that, within this range of operating income of 6% to 8%, that you're now towards the lower end of this and then the tax comes in to give you the confidence to reiterate the range? Is that a correct way to look at these pieces of guidance?\n\n---\n\nWell, it's -- certainly, from the operating results from the quarter, we had puts and takes. We had the strong growth in the international markets, and then we had, obviously, the U.S. consumer results that you saw, as we reported. It's too early for us to be that specific. I think all we're saying at this stage is really that we acknowledge that the tax rate is more favorable, so that gives us more confidence in the upper end of the range. As we progress through the year, I think our statements around that operating income range, we confirm those up as we see the traction in the U.S. consumer business and how the programs are playing out as we progress through the year.\n\n---\n\nAll right. I guess I was hoping that you might give me confidence that you actually can hit the upper end of that operating income because, of course, the second quarter numbers would maybe give most people the opposite impression, given the decline in consumer, I mean, which is obviously very concerning.\n\n---\n\nWell, we certainly are encouraged, as you heard in Alan's comments, by all the programs and activities that we have lined up for the back half of the year. So I don't want to convey that we don't believe we're able to certainly return to a growth mode in that business. But at the same time, as you know, the third and fourth quarters start to be the biggest parts of our year, so we just have to see how it plays out for the rest of the year.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Last question just on the tax rate. This is a little specific, so apologies for it, but it's important. The lower tax rate, is it a function of specific discrete benefits or would you describe this as more of a mix issue? Because, obviously, when you have the U.S. business underperforming, it fundamentally has a mix effect on the tax rate. But I would like to understand the difference between the discrete benefits and the mix issue.\n\n---\n\nYes. There's some minor discrete benefits, and it's by -- the vast majority of the adjustment reflects the mix of the geographies across tax jurisdictions.\n\n---\n\nA couple of questions. First, on WAPC benefits. As you lapped closing the transaction May 31, do you anticipate still getting kind of distribution benefits? And as we go forward, can you -- will that be reported? It won't be reported separately, but is that going to lift the same-store results, I guess, of the business? Is WAPC growing on a same-store basis right now?\n\n---\n\nYes. WAPC is growing on a same-store basis, and we do expect that to continue. It's continuing to expand both geographically and in penetration. And the other thing that we're working and starting to do is to develop some synergies between our core selling force in the coastal regions, where they'll sell more of the WAPC items, and the WAPC sales force, which will sell more of the McCormick items in the central region. So we're encouraged by the growth rates there and pretty bullish on that business.\n\n---\n\nAnd one other thing I wanted to follow up on, you made a comment in your prepared remarks about the -- being pleased with the ROI you're getting with the ad spending and media spending you're doing in the -- I think that was the U.S. market you were referring to. Could you give us more clarity on how you measure that? And if you're getting positive ROI, does that mean we'll see more of spending in the U.S. market to sort of turn things around second half of the year?\n\n---\n\nYes, and that's exactly what we've said as well. What -- the way we measure that is with a classic marketing mix. And we're looking at the impact on that marketing in the short term. Where we're spending our money is about half in TV, half in digital and PR, and so we're encouraged by what we're seeing. What you'll see in the back half is additional support for our big programs like holiday, fall cooking and also some digital initiatives that will help to drive some of our new sales -- our new product sales.\n\n---\n\nAlan, you talked about the market share losses in the core spice and seasoning business not being as significant as they were compared to the fourth quarter. Were -- how did they compare, I guess, sequentially versus the first quarter? Because I think, as of the last conference call, you certainly sound a relatively optimistic tone, at least from an early days preliminary perspective, on the reaction to some of the things you were trying to do in the marketplace. And in this call, obviously, you're suggesting making progress but of course, still have a ways to go. So I'm trying to get a sense if anything has changed from the first quarter. And if so, what led to that?\n\n---\n\nNo, I wouldn't say that anything has changed from the first quarter. The share results are pretty similar. I will say that, if there's anything, there's a little bit of optimism because we grew share in recipe mixes and have started to see some growth there. But I wouldn't say that there is a dramatic change from the first quarter.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then in terms of seasonal sell-in and such, I guess, in the last year or 2, I may have it wrong, you've sort of pushed forward or pulled forward the time frame in which you'll sell in a lot of the seasonal displays because you've  found that the sooner those kind of get in store, the more folks are charged up around the seasons and end up coming back and such. Is that a program that you're staying with around the timing for those reasons? Or has it already changed based on the last year or so?\n\n---\n\nYes. We still have the holiday program, which we've had for, I think, about 8 or 9 years now, which is to get the holiday -- the specific displays into stores as early as possible. Obviously, year-on-year, we have a lot of fluctuation based on the timing that some specific large customers take their holiday shipments. Sometimes they'll be in the third quarter; sometimes they'll be in the fourth. Last year, because it was also combined with a price increase, we had a fairly heavy buy-in on that and saw the impact in the third quarter and then the resulting hangover in the fourth. But we're still offering that program. We don't think it will be as significant this year as it was last year when we're having a price increase.\n\n---\n\nGot it, right. In terms of the shift between...\n\n---\n\nIn terms of the shift between quarters, yes. We expect it to be -- and this year actually does look like more of a normalized pattern, and we're seeing some of that with our shipments in the second quarter versus the third that are going to be closer into consumption.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And very last thing, the -- this updated sort of or ideal shelf set, gold standard shelf set, are there certain -- what are the certain time frames in which your sales team is able to sort of get this sold in and more importantly, that those shelves would get reset, whether there are certain one or 2 time frames through the course of your fiscal year where you can really expect that, once they're sold in, for them to start actually happening in store?\n\n---\n\nYes. Most customers have their own timing, so it's not a -- there's not a specific time across the country where that happens. Some customers reset -- generally, most customers will want to reset prior to the fall, specifically in our category. But we're cutting in new items in January, and we're cutting in new items in June, so it's hard to say that there's a specific time for that. But where we are, we're seeing progress in helping customers understand that this is a very, very profitable category for them, that our interests are really aligned, and the more they sell premium-branded products, the higher the level of their profit and that we bring consumers to the shelf. And that's the thing that we're working with them on.\n\n---\n\nI have 2 questions. First, top line related, to focus on EMEA for a second, is it -- I mean it sounds like the industrial side of things continues to go well there. But it almost sounds like, from your comments around the U.K., which is such an important market for you, that things have gotten a little bit worse. Is that accurate? And if so, kind of what are the plans to try to improve the U.K.?\n\n---\n\nYes. The U.K. market is a specifically tough market, and there's been a lot of press on the large customers there and some of their challenges. Specific to what we're doing in our business, it's very similar to what we're doing in the U.S with new products and with supporting our brands with advertising. In the short term, what we saw was a fair amount of competitive activity in the recipe mix category in the U.K. We're responding pretty aggressively with that with our own promotional plans.\n\n---\n\nOkay. All right. And then to kind of switch over, I think you've been calling for somewhat inflationary trends in your more esoteric input cost base for a bit. But can you update us on that? Is there any more concern? It seems like there's just generally a little more inflation than everybody expected. And then related to that, you took the price increase last fall. I think in retrospect, you said maybe it wasn't the right thing to do or the right time. And given all the competition, even with input cost pressure, are you unlikely to take pricing on the consumer side going into '15?\n\n---\n\nYes. We're not anticipating any near-term pricing, any -- new near-term pricing in our consumer business at this point. We may have some adjustments in our industrial business to reflect changes in commodity costs, but we're not anticipating near term that we'll be doing that. There is some upward cost inflation, specifically in commodities like pepper and vanilla, and we're working with our CCI programs to help to try to offset those. Obviously, if it gets excessive, then we'll readjust our thinking. But certainly, we're not anticipating anything before the end of 2014.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And Gordon, just remind me what inflation level are you assuming for the year again.\n\n---\n\nWe said it was in the low-single-digits, 2% to 3%.\n\n---\n\nSo a couple of questions just on the end demand and what you see as it relates to your consumer business because I think you get some good read-throughs on what's happening with packaged food customers and then QSR. So the first question is in the U.S., can you talk a little bit about the innovation pipeline for your packaged food customers as you see it? I think a little bit ago, you had said that you're pretty optimistic about that pipeline, and it doesn't seem to have played through. So perhaps you could just give us your perspective on what's happened there with a little bit of history as to why it hasn't played through, if I'm correct about that. And then the second question is on just the state of demand -- or state of things in the QSR segment in China. If you can help us to understand, from your perspective, where we are relative to all the issues that are taking place from a food security perspective. So those are my 2 questions.\n\n---\n\nYes, sure. On U.S. foods, we're seeing a bit of a mix with our customer base. Our snack customers are continuing to do pretty well and continuing to innovate, and we're seeing that reflected. Our packaged food customers are struggling with core volume, and part of the way that they are trying to overcome that is with new product innovation that we're working with them on. Now -- so what we have with packaged foods or with our consumer food manufacturer customer so far, in the U.S. at least, is relatively flat, snacks up, core processed foods kind of down a little bit and new product not quite offsetting those. We have a stronger innovation pipeline this year than we had at this time last year, so we continue to have a good outlook on that. Obviously, as customers adjust their thinking and focus more on promotional spending or on driving different core products, they may change that. But our innovation pipeline is stronger this year than last year in our U.S. business. In China, what we're seeing is a recovery in QSR, driven, I think, a lot by our customers having an increased frequency of promotions and limited time offers to bring consumers back to the stores. They've historically been pretty resilient, and they're obviously up against some weaker comparisons from last year. But we're encouraged by what we're seeing with both new product activity in China, as well as the increased foot traffic that they're getting to the stores. And we're seeing a renewed confidence in new store openings there as well, so we're optimistic on the outlook there.\n\n---\n\nAnd just one on India, if I can. So can you -- I know it's a smallish percentage of your overall business, but it's one of those rare things where you acquire a business and it doesn't go as well as you plan. So can you just give us a sense of where we are in that process and if and when the distribution gains will again start to take effect? Because the way I understand what's going on is you bought the business, there's been some, obviously, commodity-related inflation that you're passing on, and you don't have the -- or your distribution gains have sort of paused for now and then you're also recalibrating your product mix, right? I mean, the whole idea there is to do recipe mixes and other things such as that under the McCormick brand using this distribution. So just give us a longer term, sort of where are we in the journey with this acquisition and your expectations there.\n\n---\n\nYes. We think India is a longer -- certainly a longer-term play. We've made good progress in stabilizing our supply chain and continuing to drive distribution. Obviously, the significant inflation we've seen in the price of basmati rice has impacted our volumes there. We're again taking the philosophy that we generally take in a market like this that we pay as we go. So as the business earns its ability to invest, then we'll make the investments. And so we're focused now on driving profitability in the business, and we're also introducing the new products but more on driving the profitability of the business. We still believe, as India develops in modern trade, as the infrastructure develops, that it will be a very good market for us. It's taken a little more time than we anticipated as we went into it.\n\n---\n\nIn looking at your guidance, you're talking about an incremental brand marketing spend of at least $25 million. Gordon, did I hear you say $11 million of that increase was in the first half already?\n\n---\n\nThat's correct.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Now does that $25 million include consumer promotion activity? Or is it strictly more of what we would call advertising?\n\n---\n\nThe bulk of it is weighted more towards consumer-facing advertising. Any traditional promotional around price, et cetera, would be between the gross and net. So that's -- primarily, that is -- not primarily. That is consumer-facing increases.\n\n---\n\nSo promotion expenditures would be in addition to it?\n\n---\n\nYes, that would be in addition.\n\n---\n\nAnd how do you expect that to track this year, the promotion?\n\n---\n\nFrom a year-over-year basis, not too differently. But as you heard in my remarks and some of Alan's remarks, some of it is weighted a bit more towards the back half of the year.\n\n---\n\nI don't think anyone had asked this yet, so forgive me if they had. But Alan, you talked a little bit about working with customers to get the price gap right between branded and private label. I'm just curious whether this gap had grown to an unusually wide level and you're just sort of getting back to normal or whether the gap that historically existed, I don't know, maybe didn't function as effectively as it used to, right? So curious if you're just going to narrow it to a range that's smaller than usual or just sort of get back to normal. And maybe I'm not even reading that right at all. I'm just curious how you think about that.\n\n---\n\nIt's actually a really good question. The gap itself hasn't changed that much. I mean it does over periods where we tend to lead with pricing, and private label takes a little bit longer to catch up, as do our competitors, so we tend to see a 3- to 6-month gap in that. The impact that we're dealing with right now is more where some customers have chosen to take price threshold movement, not necessarily a percentage gap, but more price threshold. So for instance, they may have crossed from $2.97 to $3.09, which is a more significant impact for customers. So we're working to also get price points right so that we maximize the volume and the profit for the customers. The percentage gaps haven't changed that much over the last 7 years. They do from time to time, but not -- it's not any more significant. In fact, what we've seen in the most recent periods is a little more aggressive pricing on private label than we've seen on the brands. So by aggressive, I mean the price gaps have narrowed a little more.\n\n---\n\nI want to thank everyone for your questions and for participating on today's call. As I wrap up, I'd like to recognize Chuck Langmead, President of our Global Industrial Business. As previously announced, Chuck's retiring at the end of June, following a 38th year at McCormick. Under his leadership, annual sales of our industrial business have exceeded $1.5 billion and profits are up nearly 40% in the last 5 years. I want to thank Chuck for his service, his dedication and his contributions, and I wish him all the best. \r\nMcCormick's 2014 fiscal year is on track to be a record year in sales and profits. Our strategic imperatives around people, growth and performance are driving sales, delivering CCI cost savings and generating higher profits and strong cash flow. We bring the joy of flavor to every day at McCormick, and we believe that we're well positioned for future success. Thank you.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Alan. I'd also like to thank those on this morning's call. Through July 10, a replay of the call can be accessed by dialing (877) 660-6853, and the conference ID number is 13581413. You can also listen to a replay on our website later today. And if you have any additional questions regarding today's information, you can reach us at (410) 771-7244. This concludes this morning's call.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Kenneth Goldman (Analysts)】\nAlan, your Nielsen numbers, they showed a decline but not to the degree you reported domestically. So I guess I'm curious if you could help us understand that disparity a bit. And Gordon talked about a later grilling season, so I'm curious if it was a shipment timing issue or maybe channel issue or non-measured, you're maybe doing a little bit less impressively than measured. I'm just trying to, I guess, understand that dynamic a bit better.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alan Wilson (Executives)】\nYes. It's pretty hard to calibrate all the different sources of information. We use IRI, and we have a custom database. So from our outlook -- I'll talk more generally without trying to get into specifics of the data as to what's happening. From our view, what we saw was less of a decline in share than we saw in the fourth quarter of last year. Partly, we think that some of our efforts at retail are starting to have an impact. It's going to be -- it's going to take some time, and we expect that we will win. But in terms of getting to the data specifics, it's really hard for us to get. There was a later start to the grilling season. The weather was not favorable for grilling. We're expecting a pretty good grilling season as we go through the summer, and we're planning to extend it through the third quarter and even through Labor Day and to tailgate season, so we're pretty encouraged. Most of our new products are going to hit in the second half of the year, and we're pretty excited about those as well.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kenneth Goldman (Analysts)】\nAnd then if I can ask one more, Gordon, we're seeing a good number of packaged food companies thinking about rationalizing production and overhead in the U.S. Even Mills, right, which has an ongoing cost savings program, just like yours, I think, is going this route. So curious if you guys are considering going down this road or if you're comfortable with your cost structure, I guess, at the moment.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gordon Stetz (Executives)】\nWell, you always need to challenge yourself to be competitive, and that's the whole nature of the CCI environment. And the idea behind the program, as you know, Ken, when we developed it a few years ago, was to keep looking at those opportunities on a go-forward basis, and you can never stop. I will calibrate it a bit, though, in that if you recall, a few years ago, in the North American businesses, in particular, we did some significant rationalization, in the -- in particular, in the consumer side, where we did reduce our number of plants. And so therefore, our footprint is pretty consolidated here in the U.S. in our consumer business. In the industrial side, our plants tend to be more specialized for customer service needs. But having said that, we constantly look at our network and the best way to organize ourselves, so we still look for these opportunities all the time.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alan Wilson (Executives)】\nAnd we have adjusted our SG&A and headcount for the volumes that we've seen and we've been -- both in manufacturing as well as in our headquarters.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Alexia Howard (Analysts)】\nCan I just ask for a little bit more granularity on the share losses? Could you remind us, is it concentrated in a particular region with a particular type of retailer? Is it private label you're losing share to or value brands or premium brands? And do you know which consumer segments you're losing share to? Is it the Hispanic group? Is it millennial consumers or older consumers? Just a little bit more detail on how you're seeing the development of those share changes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alan Wilson (Executives)】\nYes. And it's changed a bit in the more recent periods. Private label is more flat. Most of the -- we have one larger branded competitor, and that competitor is relatively flat. And so what we're seeing is very small inroads from a number of small and regional competitors that are gaining 1/10 of a share point or point -- 2/10 of a share point. Their overall share base is still less than 1% or 2% I think, as we -- I looked at the most recent period and of the 10 brands that gained share, no one, other than McCormick -- by the way, our core A to Z, actually gained a slight bit in the most recent period. But nobody had more than 2% share in all that. So it's pretty -- what's happening is the consumer and the retailers are pretty fragmenting. And some of that's on the value end, some of that's on the premium end. We compete across both of those segments, and so we've got different tactics that we're using to compete with the superpremium, in some cases, even bagged spices that are finding their way into measured markets and then on the premium end with what we're doing with our innovation.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Moskow (Analysts)】\nGordon, I was trying to reconcile the guidance. With the operating income being up 6% to 8%, the tax rate down, share count down, we're getting a number that seems to go beyond the high end of your range for EPS at $3.29. I just want to make sure I'm doing this right. So is the 6% to 8% -- is there -- are we supposed to reduce that for currency? Or is that 6% to 8% absorbing the currency?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gordon Stetz (Executives)】\nIt's getting pressure from currency, I'd say that. But I don't want to be more specific than that. Obviously, currency is going to put some pressure on that number. The other thing on the operating income line, as you heard Alan talk about, is we are supporting our business in the back half of the year. We've spent year-to-date $11 million in advertising and promotion, and we've said [ph] at least $25 million in the back half. So that's going to be a factor impacting those numbers as well. And then just to help calibrate the tax rate, that tax rate -- unfavorability, as you know, is very much weighted towards the back half of the year, so that's also something else that needs to be factored in because that all starts to occur. I think our last year's rate for the second half was a little north of 25%, and at 29.5%, that's quite a drag on the EPS in the back half of the year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Moskow (Analysts)】\nOkay. Gordon, I get that. But just to be more clear, your sales guidance is in constant currency so I'm not -- I know what to do with that. And you have 1% hit for ForEx on the top line. Is it also a 1% hit on the operating income line? Does it flow through? And is the 6% to 8% x currency or not?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gordon Stetz (Executives)】\nThe 6% to 8% is not x currency. That's all in, so it would reflect whatever pressure that currency drops through to the bottom line. And generally, it's not a one-for-one relationship, but there's certainly a negative hit on that 6% to 8% from currency.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Moskow (Analysts)】\nAll right. I got it now. So last question, in fourth quarter, that's your biggest quarter, especially in the U.S., for seasonal reasons. Are your market share -- do you expect your market share to be down again in fourth quarter in the U.S., Alan? Or are you going to have lapped those market share losses by that time and therefore, we can expect kind of a normal growth pattern for fourth quarter?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alan Wilson (Executives)】\nWe expect to stabilize and start to grow our share. But certainly, in the fourth quarter, we think we will have lapped the impact in share from last year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Moskow (Analysts)】\nOkay. So you would expect like a pretty good seasonal time period this year? Have you got initial sell-in already for how much inventory your customers are looking at for the seasons?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alan Wilson (Executives)】\nYes. We're selling in right now. The display programs are the easiest things for us to track. The turn orders are a little more difficult. But we're encouraged by what we're seeing with our holiday sale-in at this point.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Driscoll (Analysts)】\nI want to go back to the question that Rob was asking a moment ago about the guidance. I'm going to try it a different way though. So if all the numbers are unchanged, except we have a nice lower tax rate, 100 basis points of tax, if I go from the midpoint of what the prior range was to the new one, that's worth like $0.05. So the other observation is, is that the segment results are coming in, especially this quarter, weaker than what we had modeled. So is it fair to say that, within this range of operating income of 6% to 8%, that you're now towards the lower end of this and then the tax comes in to give you the confidence to reiterate the range? Is that a correct way to look at these pieces of guidance?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gordon Stetz (Executives)】\nWell, it's -- certainly, from the operating results from the quarter, we had puts and takes. We had the strong growth in the international markets, and then we had, obviously, the U.S. consumer results that you saw, as we reported. It's too early for us to be that specific. I think all we're saying at this stage is really that we acknowledge that the tax rate is more favorable, so that gives us more confidence in the upper end of the range. As we progress through the year, I think our statements around that operating income range, we confirm those up as we see the traction in the U.S. consumer business and how the programs are playing out as we progress through the year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Driscoll (Analysts)】\nAll right. I guess I was hoping that you might give me confidence that you actually can hit the upper end of that operating income because, of course, the second quarter numbers would maybe give most people the opposite impression, given the decline in consumer, I mean, which is obviously very concerning.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gordon Stetz (Executives)】\nWell, we certainly are encouraged, as you heard in Alan's comments, by all the programs and activities that we have lined up for the back half of the year. So I don't want to convey that we don't believe we're able to certainly return to a growth mode in that business. But at the same time, as you know, the third and fourth quarters start to be the biggest parts of our year, so we just have to see how it plays out for the rest of the year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Driscoll (Analysts)】\nOkay. Last question just on the tax rate. This is a little specific, so apologies for it, but it's important. The lower tax rate, is it a function of specific discrete benefits or would you describe this as more of a mix issue? Because, obviously, when you have the U.S. business underperforming, it fundamentally has a mix effect on the tax rate. But I would like to understand the difference between the discrete benefits and the mix issue.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gordon Stetz (Executives)】\nYes. There's some minor discrete benefits, and it's by -- the vast majority of the adjustment reflects the mix of the geographies across tax jurisdictions.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jonathan Feeney (Analysts)】\nA couple of questions. First, on WAPC benefits. As you lapped closing the transaction May 31, do you anticipate still getting kind of distribution benefits? And as we go forward, can you -- will that be reported? It won't be reported separately, but is that going to lift the same-store results, I guess, of the business? Is WAPC growing on a same-store basis right now?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alan Wilson (Executives)】\nYes. WAPC is growing on a same-store basis, and we do expect that to continue. It's continuing to expand both geographically and in penetration. And the other thing that we're working and starting to do is to develop some synergies between our core selling force in the coastal regions, where they'll sell more of the WAPC items, and the WAPC sales force, which will sell more of the McCormick items in the central region. So we're encouraged by the growth rates there and pretty bullish on that business.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jonathan Feeney (Analysts)】\nAnd one other thing I wanted to follow up on, you made a comment in your prepared remarks about the -- being pleased with the ROI you're getting with the ad spending and media spending you're doing in the -- I think that was the U.S. market you were referring to. Could you give us more clarity on how you measure that? And if you're getting positive ROI, does that mean we'll see more of spending in the U.S. market to sort of turn things around second half of the year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alan Wilson (Executives)】\nYes, and that's exactly what we've said as well. What -- the way we measure that is with a classic marketing mix. And we're looking at the impact on that marketing in the short term. Where we're spending our money is about half in TV, half in digital and PR, and so we're encouraged by what we're seeing. What you'll see in the back half is additional support for our big programs like holiday, fall cooking and also some digital initiatives that will help to drive some of our new sales -- our new product sales.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Lazar (Analysts)】\nAlan, you talked about the market share losses in the core spice and seasoning business not being as significant as they were compared to the fourth quarter. Were -- how did they compare, I guess, sequentially versus the first quarter? Because I think, as of the last conference call, you certainly sound a relatively optimistic tone, at least from an early days preliminary perspective, on the reaction to some of the things you were trying to do in the marketplace. And in this call, obviously, you're suggesting making progress but of course, still have a ways to go. So I'm trying to get a sense if anything has changed from the first quarter. And if so, what led to that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alan Wilson (Executives)】\nNo, I wouldn't say that anything has changed from the first quarter. The share results are pretty similar. I will say that, if there's anything, there's a little bit of optimism because we grew share in recipe mixes and have started to see some growth there. But I wouldn't say that there is a dramatic change from the first quarter.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Lazar (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then in terms of seasonal sell-in and such, I guess, in the last year or 2, I may have it wrong, you've sort of pushed forward or pulled forward the time frame in which you'll sell in a lot of the seasonal displays because you've  found that the sooner those kind of get in store, the more folks are charged up around the seasons and end up coming back and such. Is that a program that you're staying with around the timing for those reasons? Or has it already changed based on the last year or so?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alan Wilson (Executives)】\nYes. We still have the holiday program, which we've had for, I think, about 8 or 9 years now, which is to get the holiday -- the specific displays into stores as early as possible. Obviously, year-on-year, we have a lot of fluctuation based on the timing that some specific large customers take their holiday shipments. Sometimes they'll be in the third quarter; sometimes they'll be in the fourth. Last year, because it was also combined with a price increase, we had a fairly heavy buy-in on that and saw the impact in the third quarter and then the resulting hangover in the fourth. But we're still offering that program. We don't think it will be as significant this year as it was last year when we're having a price increase.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Lazar (Analysts)】\nGot it, right. In terms of the shift between...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alan Wilson (Executives)】\nIn terms of the shift between quarters, yes. We expect it to be -- and this year actually does look like more of a normalized pattern, and we're seeing some of that with our shipments in the second quarter versus the third that are going to be closer into consumption.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Lazar (Analysts)】\nOkay. And very last thing, the -- this updated sort of or ideal shelf set, gold standard shelf set, are there certain -- what are the certain time frames in which your sales team is able to sort of get this sold in and more importantly, that those shelves would get reset, whether there are certain one or 2 time frames through the course of your fiscal year where you can really expect that, once they're sold in, for them to start actually happening in store?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alan Wilson (Executives)】\nYes. Most customers have their own timing, so it's not a -- there's not a specific time across the country where that happens. Some customers reset -- generally, most customers will want to reset prior to the fall, specifically in our category. But we're cutting in new items in January, and we're cutting in new items in June, so it's hard to say that there's a specific time for that. But where we are, we're seeing progress in helping customers understand that this is a very, very profitable category for them, that our interests are really aligned, and the more they sell premium-branded products, the higher the level of their profit and that we bring consumers to the shelf. And that's the thing that we're working with them on.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Eric Katzman (Analysts)】\nI have 2 questions. First, top line related, to focus on EMEA for a second, is it -- I mean it sounds like the industrial side of things continues to go well there. But it almost sounds like, from your comments around the U.K., which is such an important market for you, that things have gotten a little bit worse. Is that accurate? And if so, kind of what are the plans to try to improve the U.K.?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alan Wilson (Executives)】\nYes. The U.K. market is a specifically tough market, and there's been a lot of press on the large customers there and some of their challenges. Specific to what we're doing in our business, it's very similar to what we're doing in the U.S with new products and with supporting our brands with advertising. In the short term, what we saw was a fair amount of competitive activity in the recipe mix category in the U.K. We're responding pretty aggressively with that with our own promotional plans.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Eric Katzman (Analysts)】\nOkay. All right. And then to kind of switch over, I think you've been calling for somewhat inflationary trends in your more esoteric input cost base for a bit. But can you update us on that? Is there any more concern? It seems like there's just generally a little more inflation than everybody expected. And then related to that, you took the price increase last fall. I think in retrospect, you said maybe it wasn't the right thing to do or the right time. And given all the competition, even with input cost pressure, are you unlikely to take pricing on the consumer side going into '15?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alan Wilson (Executives)】\nYes. We're not anticipating any near-term pricing, any -- new near-term pricing in our consumer business at this point. We may have some adjustments in our industrial business to reflect changes in commodity costs, but we're not anticipating near term that we'll be doing that. There is some upward cost inflation, specifically in commodities like pepper and vanilla, and we're working with our CCI programs to help to try to offset those. Obviously, if it gets excessive, then we'll readjust our thinking. But certainly, we're not anticipating anything before the end of 2014.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Eric Katzman (Analysts)】\nOkay. And Gordon, just remind me what inflation level are you assuming for the year again.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gordon Stetz (Executives)】\nWe said it was in the low-single-digits, 2% to 3%.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Akshay Jagdale (Analysts)】\nSo a couple of questions just on the end demand and what you see as it relates to your consumer business because I think you get some good read-throughs on what's happening with packaged food customers and then QSR. So the first question is in the U.S., can you talk a little bit about the innovation pipeline for your packaged food customers as you see it? I think a little bit ago, you had said that you're pretty optimistic about that pipeline, and it doesn't seem to have played through. So perhaps you could just give us your perspective on what's happened there with a little bit of history as to why it hasn't played through, if I'm correct about that. And then the second question is on just the state of demand -- or state of things in the QSR segment in China. If you can help us to understand, from your perspective, where we are relative to all the issues that are taking place from a food security perspective. So those are my 2 questions.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alan Wilson (Executives)】\nYes, sure. On U.S. foods, we're seeing a bit of a mix with our customer base. Our snack customers are continuing to do pretty well and continuing to innovate, and we're seeing that reflected. Our packaged food customers are struggling with core volume, and part of the way that they are trying to overcome that is with new product innovation that we're working with them on. Now -- so what we have with packaged foods or with our consumer food manufacturer customer so far, in the U.S. at least, is relatively flat, snacks up, core processed foods kind of down a little bit and new product not quite offsetting those. We have a stronger innovation pipeline this year than we had at this time last year, so we continue to have a good outlook on that. Obviously, as customers adjust their thinking and focus more on promotional spending or on driving different core products, they may change that. But our innovation pipeline is stronger this year than last year in our U.S. business. In China, what we're seeing is a recovery in QSR, driven, I think, a lot by our customers having an increased frequency of promotions and limited time offers to bring consumers back to the stores. They've historically been pretty resilient, and they're obviously up against some weaker comparisons from last year. But we're encouraged by what we're seeing with both new product activity in China, as well as the increased foot traffic that they're getting to the stores. And we're seeing a renewed confidence in new store openings there as well, so we're optimistic on the outlook there.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Akshay Jagdale (Analysts)】\nAnd just one on India, if I can. So can you -- I know it's a smallish percentage of your overall business, but it's one of those rare things where you acquire a business and it doesn't go as well as you plan. So can you just give us a sense of where we are in that process and if and when the distribution gains will again start to take effect? Because the way I understand what's going on is you bought the business, there's been some, obviously, commodity-related inflation that you're passing on, and you don't have the -- or your distribution gains have sort of paused for now and then you're also recalibrating your product mix, right? I mean, the whole idea there is to do recipe mixes and other things such as that under the McCormick brand using this distribution. So just give us a longer term, sort of where are we in the journey with this acquisition and your expectations there.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alan Wilson (Executives)】\nYes. We think India is a longer -- certainly a longer-term play. We've made good progress in stabilizing our supply chain and continuing to drive distribution. Obviously, the significant inflation we've seen in the price of basmati rice has impacted our volumes there. We're again taking the philosophy that we generally take in a market like this that we pay as we go. So as the business earns its ability to invest, then we'll make the investments. And so we're focused now on driving profitability in the business, and we're also introducing the new products but more on driving the profitability of the business. We still believe, as India develops in modern trade, as the infrastructure develops, that it will be a very good market for us. It's taken a little more time than we anticipated as we went into it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Cerankosky (Analysts)】\nIn looking at your guidance, you're talking about an incremental brand marketing spend of at least $25 million. Gordon, did I hear you say $11 million of that increase was in the first half already?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gordon Stetz (Executives)】\nThat's correct.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Cerankosky (Analysts)】\nOkay. Now does that $25 million include consumer promotion activity? Or is it strictly more of what we would call advertising?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gordon Stetz (Executives)】\nThe bulk of it is weighted more towards consumer-facing advertising. Any traditional promotional around price, et cetera, would be between the gross and net. So that's -- primarily, that is -- not primarily. That is consumer-facing increases.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Cerankosky (Analysts)】\nSo promotion expenditures would be in addition to it?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gordon Stetz (Executives)】\nYes, that would be in addition.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Cerankosky (Analysts)】\nAnd how do you expect that to track this year, the promotion?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gordon Stetz (Executives)】\nFrom a year-over-year basis, not too differently. But as you heard in my remarks and some of Alan's remarks, some of it is weighted a bit more towards the back half of the year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kenneth Goldman (Analysts)】\nI don't think anyone had asked this yet, so forgive me if they had. But Alan, you talked a little bit about working with customers to get the price gap right between branded and private label. I'm just curious whether this gap had grown to an unusually wide level and you're just sort of getting back to normal or whether the gap that historically existed, I don't know, maybe didn't function as effectively as it used to, right? So curious if you're just going to narrow it to a range that's smaller than usual or just sort of get back to normal. And maybe I'm not even reading that right at all. I'm just curious how you think about that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alan Wilson (Executives)】\nIt's actually a really good question. The gap itself hasn't changed that much. I mean it does over periods where we tend to lead with pricing, and private label takes a little bit longer to catch up, as do our competitors, so we tend to see a 3- to 6-month gap in that. The impact that we're dealing with right now is more where some customers have chosen to take price threshold movement, not necessarily a percentage gap, but more price threshold. So for instance, they may have crossed from $2.97 to $3.09, which is a more significant impact for customers. So we're working to also get price points right so that we maximize the volume and the profit for the customers. The percentage gaps haven't changed that much over the last 7 years. They do from time to time, but not -- it's not any more significant. In fact, what we've seen in the most recent periods is a little more aggressive pricing on private label than we've seen on the brands. So by aggressive, I mean the price gaps have narrowed a little more.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alan Wilson (Executives)】\nI want to thank everyone for your questions and for participating on today's call. As I wrap up, I'd like to recognize Chuck Langmead, President of our Global Industrial Business. As previously announced, Chuck's retiring at the end of June, following a 38th year at McCormick. Under his leadership, annual sales of our industrial business have exceeded $1.5 billion and profits are up nearly 40% in the last 5 years. I want to thank Chuck for his service, his dedication and his contributions, and I wish him all the best. \r\nMcCormick's 2014 fiscal year is on track to be a record year in sales and profits. Our strategic imperatives around people, growth and performance are driving sales, delivering CCI cost savings and generating higher profits and strong cash flow. We bring the joy of flavor to every day at McCormick, and we believe that we're well positioned for future success. Thank you.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Joyce Brooks (Executives)】\nThanks, Alan. I'd also like to thank those on this morning's call. Through July 10, a replay of the call can be accessed by dialing (877) 660-6853, and the conference ID number is 13581413. You can also listen to a replay on our website later today. And if you have any additional questions regarding today's information, you can reach us at (410) 771-7244.

As the operator indicated, participants on today's call may discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the appropriate reconciliations on our press release, which was issued about an hour ago, and at our website, investors.nikeinc.com.\r\nJoining us on today's call will be NIKE, Inc. President and CEO, Mark Parker; followed by Trevor Edwards, President of the NIKE Brand; and finally, you will hear from our Chief Financial Officer, Don Blair, who will give you an in-depth review of our financial results. Following their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. [Operator Instructions] With that, I'll now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc. President and CEO, Mark Parker.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Kelley, and hello, everybody. Fiscal '14 demonstrated a point I often make, and that's when we innovate, we just don't innovate for the sake of change. We innovate to change the game. And that's what we did throughout the year. We introduced great products, launched new consumer experiences, expanded our digital ecosystem and developed engaging retail concepts that drove excitement and energy for our brands in the marketplace.\r\nBy staying true to the NIKE spirit, we continued to deliver great results like those we're reporting today. Here are the fiscal '14 highlights.\r\nNIKE, Inc. revenues grew 10% to nearly $28 billion. Gross margin increased 120 basis points to 44.8%. SG&A rose 12%, reflecting continued strategic investments in our brands and operations. And despite significant currency pressure, diluted EPS rose 11% to $2.97 for the full year. We're proud of those results we delivered in fiscal '14, but more than that, we're proud of the consistent level of growth we've been able to deliver over the years.\r\nAs we continue to get bigger as a company, I'm often asked, how can NIKE continue to grow? Well, first and foremost, there's absolutely no shortage of growth opportunities for NIKE. This has never been as clear to me as it is today. When I look within and across our 5 brands, 6 geographies and 8 categories, I see tremendous untapped potential. And this includes areas where we can build on our current foundation, such as Apparel and Women's and Converse, as well as areas where we can extend our current leadership position, such as running, basketball and football.\r\nThe key to unlocking this potential is, and always has been, to focus on the consumer. Our relationship with the consumer is something we need to earn every day. Increasingly, this relationship is one-to-one through the lens of their favorite sport. This is why our category offense is such a powerful advantage. The insights we draw from our deep consumer connections fuel our ability to create new products and services that excite and engage.\r\nWe also know we need to remain nimble to meet the changing needs and expectations of those we serve globally. The world is becoming increasingly interconnected, and consumers expect companies to be able to deliver the same level of innovation everywhere. And that means continuing to elevate and accelerate our level of innovation in products, in services, in our supply chain and in our digital ecosystem.\r\nWe also know that when we focus on the consumer, we deliver value for our shareholders. We do this by ensuring our growth is profitable. The strength and diversity of the NIKE, Inc. portfolio allows us to manage the levers in our business to drive profitability and invest for the future, so we can continue to innovate to meet the expectations of our consumers. And that is what you saw in our fiscal '14 performance across all the elements of our business, and that is the virtuous cycle that fuels our success.\r\nOur unmatched ability to innovate is how we turn insights from athletes and consumers into amazing products and services that no one else can deliver. Throughout the past year, we used key events and sports moments to launch our most forward-thinking products. Together with Kobe in Los Angeles, we introduced the KOBE 9 Elite, the first basketball shoe to use our unique Flyknit technology. At the Sochi Winter Olympics, we leveraged significant advances from across our categories to deliver high-performance apparel, such as the lightweight hockey game jersey with Flywire and the Aeroloft Summit Jacket. In New York, at the Super Bowl, we launched the Vapor Carbon Elite Cleat, our first cleat to take advantage of the revolutionary potential of 3D printing. At the world's premier track meet, the Prefontaine Classic in Eugene, Oregon, NIKE athletes set new U.S. records and world's best times in our performance racing footwear.\r\nAnd throughout fiscal '14, we've built tremendous momentum for the business and the brand as we delivered an unprecedented level of innovation heading into the World Cup. The combination of the world's best players and teams, our most innovative performance products and new levels of consumer engagement through social media is truly extraordinary. It sets a new benchmark for NIKE and the industry. There's a lot more to share with you on our execution at World Cup, but I'll save that for Trevor to discuss.\r\nThe products we launched this year were the culmination of an intense period of creativity for us. But make no mistake, there is much more in the pipeline. In fact, this is the pace of innovation that you should expect from us. We know innovation is a long-term growth driver, and that is why we have been so focused on extending our investments in this area. And we're seeing clear returns on these investments. I recently completed a comprehensive look at our product development taking place in each of our categories. And as you know, I'm someone who lives and breathes innovation, and I've never been so -- seen so much potential. I can tell you that the scope and the scale of the innovations we will be delivering for our consumers is truly incredible.\r\nOur drive to innovate extends beyond product into areas such as digital. Our consumers expect us to be digitally connected as they are, making digital one of my top priorities for the company. Athletes are demanding more real-time personalized feedback on their performance. They want easy access to products and services that will help them improve, and they want to be part of a community where they can share and compare information, find performance tips and motivate each other. We are building an integrated system of digital services that will provide seamless access to our products, a full array of services and the most advanced digital tools to measure, motivate and inspire. Delivered with the soul of sport, this will be the digital platform for lifetime consumer relationships. Our goal is to grow the Nike+ community from tens of millions to hundreds of millions of members.\r\nAn ongoing 2-way dialogue with consumers is also a critical element of our digital ecosystem. It provides us insights that drive innovation, strengthens consumers' connections to our brands and provides a platform for consumers to interact with each other. Through our social media platforms, we leverage the power and passion of sport to deepen our relationship with our consumers. A perfect example of this is our Risk Everything campaign, which celebrates the energy and enthusiasm of Global Football. Two of the campaign's videos, Winner Stays and The Last Game, have set new records for engagement with over 370 million digital views and growing.\r\nAnd finally, in e-commerce, we've made significant investments in infrastructure, capabilities and geographic expansion to provide a better experience. We know that when consumers shop online, they want a seamless premium experience. And that's our goal for NIKE.com. Our efforts are paying off. Our online business grew over 40% in fiscal '14, with the growth rate accelerating every quarter throughout the year.\r\nWhen all 3 elements of our digital ecosystem come together, it's a powerful strategy to drive growth and meet and exceed the expectations of our consumers around the world, and its potential is enormous. It is changing how we conduct our business, tell our stories and engage consumers. It's a big part of our future and will only get bigger and better.\r\nFiscal '14 has been another strong year for us, and we will take that momentum into fiscal '15. We've aligned our leadership and resources to fully leverage those opportunities with the greatest potential for growth. With our deep consumer connections and our obsessive drive to innovate, we will excite, inspire and, no doubt, surprise. That's what you should expect from NIKE in fiscal '15 and beyond.\r\nSo thanks, and now here's Trevor to discuss the NIKE Brand.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Mark. The NIKE Brand had a strong finish to a great year, one that confirms the tremendous confidence that we have in our long-term growth strategy. Looking at the results, on a constant currency basis, NIKE Brand revenue grew 13% for the quarter. For the year, revenue was up 11%, with growth across all key categories and geographies. NIKE Brand's DTC revenue was up 27% for the quarter, with 22% for the year, putting DTC revenue past the $5 billion mark. Results for the year were driven by comp store growth of 10%, new store expansion and online sales growth of 42%. And finally, global futures are up 12%.\r\nAs always, these results can be attributed to NIKE's unrivaled ability to understand the consumer, what they need and what inspires them. That knowledge drives us to identify the biggest growth opportunities and align our resources against them. Let me highlight 3 areas of the business where we've seen significant revenue expansion on a wholesale equivalent basis, clearly demonstrating the power of our consumer focus.\r\nFirst, I'll start with Global Football, which in fiscal year '14 grew 21% to $2.3 billion, and that doesn't even include our Football Sportswear product. Now I've been to Brazil many times over the past 20 years, but having just returned from Rio, I have to say I have never seen energy like that before. There's a tremendous passion for football across the country. At NIKE, our connection with Brazil is powerful. We've been there for years, and we'll be there long after the World Cup ends.\r\nThe enthusiasm we see in Brazil, coupled with our #1 footwear market share around the world, is living proof that our Football business has never been stronger, and the power of the category offense continues to fuel growth in Football, with superior executions against engaging consumer connections, innovative products and premium retail destinations.\r\nWe bring the game's passion to footballers worldwide by creating meaningful connections with them through unique events and experiences. A great example of our series -- is our series of phenomenal houses, which combine product trials, athlete appearances, football tournaments in an immersive NIKE experience. Over the last 10 weeks, the phenom houses in Rio, London and New York and many other cities hosted more than 50,000 fans and thousands more played in our Winner Stays football tournaments around the globe.\r\nAs Mark mentioned, we are incredibly proud of our successful Risk Everything campaign. For years, we've taken inspiration from the best footballers. And as we always do, we share that inspiration in the stories we tell. That kind of engaging storytelling energizes current football fans and brings new fans in, growing the market today and into the future.\r\nWe also developed an incredible number of innovative football products this year, which led up to the first match in Rio. With the most teams in the tournament, we launched 10 new team kits, achieving a new milestone in performance and sustainability. We introduced 4 groundbreaking performance boots: the Hypervenom, the Tiempo V, the Magista and Mercurial Superfly. Both the Magista and the Mercurial use our transformative Flyknit technology to take football boots to a whole new level. The players' response to these boots has been tremendous. There are more players wearing NIKE boots in the World Cup than all other brands combined, and more than 1/3 of them are playing in the distinctive and revolutionary Magista or Mercurial Flyknit boots.\r\nAnd finally, we're seeing great excitement at retail, as NIKE Football has helped drive great results in our stores, online and at football shops with our wholesale partners around the world.\r\nOur comprehensive offense on the pitch and in the marketplace drives our leadership as the world's best football brand and positions us for growth in this category for years to come.\r\nNext, I'd like to talk about Running, which is also driven by product innovation, consumer engagement and retail presentation. It's that focus that powers us, growing revenue 10% for the year to $4.6 billion. Our results were driven by key product innovations like Free Flyknit footwear, Dri-FIT Touch and Aeroloft apparel, just to name a few. And we're expanding the business by connecting with a new generation of runners. In Q4 alone, we engaged with over 85,000 runners through events and millions more via the Nike+ platform. That energy directly translates at retail worldwide, in our DTC locations and running destinations like Crosstown Running at JD Sports and the NIKE Track Club at the Finish Line. The consistent achievement in the Running category confirms the strength of our strategy and points to the massive potential we see for Running going forward.\r\nAnd third, our Women's business continues to drive strong growth. For the year, the Women's revenue grew 12% to nearly $5 billion, moving us closer to our goal of $7 billion by fiscal year '17. Our women's strategy is very clear, to combine running, training and sportswear into compelling product assortments that women want to run, train and live in, with key styles like the Legend Tights, the NIKE Pro Bras and the Sky Hi Dunks are a must-have for her. Our goal to elevate women's product distribution this year was a success. As we brought the energy of the Nike Training Club app to life at retail. We blended 3 vital components, pinnacle product assortments, premium services and great shopping experiences, that clearly demonstrate that NIKE understands this consumer's needs.\r\nThe 50-plus stores where we've executed these concepts have been outpacing comp store growth for the next -- for the rest of the fleet. Our success in fiscal year '14 only hints at the enormous opportunity we see in the Women's business, and we are completely focused on capturing it.\r\nNow let's shift focus onto a few of our key geographies. North America had another great quarter and posted a record year. Revenues were up 10% for the quarter and the year, helping North America surpass $12 billion in annual revenue. The geography also had its most profitable year ever, with reported EBIT expanding faster than reported revenue to reach $3 billion for the year.\r\nFor the last decade, we've heard that our opportunities in North America are tapped out. But as we continue to demonstrate, nothing could be further from the truth. So how do we do it? We expand the market and, at the same time, we take market share by understanding the consumer better than anyone else. We extend our leadership on our perennial strengths like the Basketball and Running categories. This expertise also gives us insight to capitalize on the significant growth opportunities like in e-commerce and in our Apparel, Women's and Young Athletes businesses, just to name a few. And as we've often discussed, our confidence in the category offense in North America gives us the roadmap to continue to unlock opportunities in this geography and around the world.\r\nNow let's turn to the emerging markets, which delivered exceptional Q4 results, with revenue up 25%. These results were very well balanced, with double-digit growth in almost every territory and increased revenues in nearly every key category. The Q4 results in our emerging markets demonstrated that our brand and products resonate with consumers in every corner of the globe. It was a great way to end a year that had some challenges. As we've talked about previously, we had logistics issues in Mexico in the first half of the year. This, combined with increased macroeconomic headwinds across Latin America, slowed revenue growth for the geography in fiscal year '14. We're continuing to closely monitor retailer inventory and the flow of product into Mexico and across Latin America to ensure the marketplace and our brand stay healthy.\r\nNow onto China, where we had one overarching goal for fiscal year '14, reset the marketplace for growth. We've made great progress, and we're on track to achieve our goal of returning this market to sustainable double-digit revenue growth. In our DTC doors, we tested and deployed new merchandising concepts, which drove Q4 comp store sales up 22%, with continued increases in profitability. We've also tightened our merchandise assortments for our wholesale partners and reprofiled hundreds of the NIKE-only stores they operate. As a result, comp store sales and profitability for their overall fleet are up, with the reprofiled stores significantly outperforming.\r\nAnd importantly, inventory levels in the marketplace are also down significantly. While we still have work to do in China, we're making great progress, and we remain confident that we have the right plan in place to achieve our true potential in this growth geography.\r\nAnd finally, there's the outstanding results we're seeing in Western Europe. Q4 revenue grew 18%, a truly remarkable finish to an incredible year, as revenues in this important geography increased 14% to nearly $5 billion for the year, with growth across all key categories and nearly every territory. The success we're seeing today in Western Europe stems from decisions we made more than 2 years ago to align our teams against the biggest growth opportunities through the category offense.\r\nWe fueled growth in fiscal year '14 by transforming the marketplace, with shop-in-shops at JD Sports, Foot Locker and Intersport, as well as our own retail stores and online. And we've only just gotten started. There are tremendous opportunities for continued growth ahead. By being focused and decisive, we now lead the market as the region's most coveted sports brand. NIKE is the #1 brand in each of the top 10 cities in Western Europe, and we're the footwear market share leader in every key country. And we're not done yet.\r\nAs we start a new fiscal year, we will continue to do what we do best: lead. Lead with the world's best innovative products and services, inspired by the greatest athletes; lead by connecting with consumers who share our passion for sport; and lead by energizing the marketplace with superior experiences at retail and online across the world.\r\nThere is no doubt about it, the momentum surrounding NIKE makes me incredibly excited about what's to come.\r\nThanks. Now here's Don.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Trevor. Our FY '14 results continue to demonstrate our ability to leverage our diversified portfolio to drive sustainable profitable growth. We're able to consistently deliver results like these for 3 key reasons. First, we invest effectively to build our business. The category offense is the framework for our growth strategy. And as Mark and Trevor described earlier, we're delivering outstanding value to consumers on each component of that framework: product, brand and marketplace. The results were clearly on display in FY '14. We continue to drive remarkable growth in North America, and we've significantly accelerated our business in both of our European geographies.\r\nUsing the learnings gathered in more developed markets, we're making great progress resetting China, while continuing to build our brands and our business in the emerging markets. Within all of those geographies, our Direct to Consumer operations are the sharp point, delivering strong growth in revenue and profits, while setting a benchmark for our brand and our business in-store and online.\r\nAnd beyond the Swoosh, we're continuing to build the Converse, Jordan and Hurley brands, reaching toward the enormous potential they each offer. The results we're reporting today flow directly from the investments we've made over the past several years, and we're confident the investments we're making today will continue to drive sustainable profitable growth well into the future.\r\nSecond, we work hard to maintain balance across growth and profitability, investments and returns, near-term and long-term results. The breadth and depth of the NIKE portfolio gives us the opportunity to invest for the future while delivering strong growth and expanding returns on capital. And that's important for us to compete effectively and to continue to deliver value for our shareholders.\r\nAnd the third reason we deliver consistent growth is that we effectively manage risk. In FY '14, we delivered 11% growth in EPS, despite losing 8 points of growth to currency headwinds. Our ability to deliver in a volatile environment demonstrates that we can pull the levers of our business to mitigate unforeseen downsides.\r\nWith that context, I'll recap our Q4 and fiscal 2014 results. NIKE, Inc. fourth quarter revenue grew 11% on a reported basis and 13% on a currency-neutral basis, bringing our revenue to $27.8 billion for the year, up 10% as reported and up 11% on a currency-neutral basis.\r\nNIKE Brand futures orders advanced 12% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by an 8% increase in units and a 4% rise in average selling price. Growth was led by continued strength in North America and Europe, even as our futures window moved beyond the World Cup. On a reported basis, futures grew 11%, reflecting weaker international currencies, particularly in Japan and developing markets such as Brazil, Argentina, Russia and Turkey.\r\nFourth quarter diluted EPS increased 3% to $0.78, bringing full year EPS to $2.97, up 11% versus last year. Strong revenue growth, gross margin expansion and a lower share count more than offset SG&A investments and currency headwinds to drive EPS growth for the quarter and the year.\r\nAs discussed on our previous call, our SG&A was more concentrated in the fourth quarter, primarily reflecting demand creation investments behind the World Cup.\r\nWe estimate the changes in currency exchange rates, including the impact on gross margin, other expense and P&L translation, reduced our year-on-year EPS growth by 7 percentage points for the fourth quarter and 8 percentage points for the full year.\r\nGross margin increased 170 basis points for the fourth quarter and 120 basis points for the year. The expansion for both periods was primarily driven by higher average prices, reflecting the power of innovative products and strong brands, as well as the continued strength of our DTC business. These upsides more than offset downward pressure from product cost inflation and FX headwinds.\r\nGross margin for the quarter was better than expected, mainly due to the strong performance of our growing DTC business, a mix shift to higher-margin product and higher margins on closeout sales.\r\nAs we expected, Q4 demand creation spending was significantly higher than last year, driven by marketing investments in the World Cup and key product initiatives. Full year demand creation grew 10%, in line with our full year revenue growth, largely driven by an increase in sports marketing expense as well as marketing for global sporting events and new product launches.\r\nOperating overhead grew 13% for the quarter and 14% for the full year. This reflected support for key growth initiatives such as DTC and consumer digital, as well as infrastructure investments to support NIKE's current and future growth. Other expense, net, was $17 million for the quarter and $103 million for the fiscal year, driven largely by foreign exchange losses, primarily from developing markets.\r\nThe fourth quarter effective tax rate was 23.5%, higher than last year's 22.9% rate, which benefited from a reduction in tax reserves related to foreign operations. For the full year, our effective tax rate was 24%, a 70-basis-point improvement over the prior year, primarily due to an increase in earnings from lower tax jurisdictions.\r\nWe continue to deliver strong returns on capital in FY '14, as ROIC reached 24.5%, 70 basis points above last year. For the year, we delivered $2.1 billion in free cash flow and returned $3.4 billion in cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends.\r\nAs of May 31, inventories were up 13%, a somewhat faster rate of growth than revenue or futures. Our inventories are healthy in most markets, reflecting builds to support the World Cup and to optimize the flow of goods in Europe and China. We are continuing to work through higher inventories in Latin America, particularly Mexico, as a result of the distribution center issues we experienced earlier in the year.\r\nNow let's look at our performance by segment. North America delivered a great year, as revenues grew 10% to $12.3 billion, marking the fourth consecutive year of double-digit revenue growth. For the fourth quarter, revenue also grew 10%, led by double-digit growth in Basketball and Global Football.\r\nIn Q4, DTC revenue grew 21%, driven by an 8% increase in comp store sales and significantly higher NIKE.com revenues. For the year, EBIT for North America grew 16%, as strong top line growth and gross margin expansion were partially offset by higher DTC operating costs and demand creation.\r\nAs Trevor described earlier, Western Europe also had a fantastic year, as revenue reached nearly $5 billion, up 14% on a currency-neutral basis. Fourth quarter revenues grew 18%. FY '14 reported revenue for Western Europe grew 19%, while EBIT increased 33%, driven by revenue growth, gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage, as well as FX benefits from the stronger euro.\r\nIn Central and Eastern Europe, currency-neutral revenues increased 12% in Q4 and 15% for the year, with growth in every key category except Action Sports, and every territory except Israel.\r\nFootball, Running and Women's Training were the fastest-growing categories, with each reporting growth of 20% or greater for the quarter and the year. Russia, Turkey, Poland and Greece each reported double-digit growth for the year.\r\nOn a reported basis, FY '14 revenue grew 13% and EBIT grew 19%, reflecting revenue growth and expanding gross margins. In Q4, EBIT fell 10%, as stiff FX headwinds and SG&A investments more than offset higher revenues.\r\nIn Greater China, currency-neutral revenue grew 2% for the quarter and 3% for the year, led by strong DTC growth.\r\nFor the year, reported revenue increased 5%, while EBIT was flat, as revenue growth and gross margin expansion were offset by higher SG&A, reflecting investments in DTC and our new headquarters in Shanghai. In Q4, EBIT fell 12%, largely reflecting the timing of demand creation and operational investments.\r\nAs Trevor noted, we're seeing great results from the actions we're taking to reset the China market for renewed growth. For FY '15, we expect revenue for the geography to grow at a high single-digit rate. As we've discussed before, we expect quarterly growth will vary as we fine-tune the seasonal flow of product into the market and given the significant variations in prior-year comparisons. We expect those factors will drive somewhat-faster revenue growth in the first quarter.\r\nIn Japan, currency-neutral revenues were flat in Q4 but up 5% for the year, driven by growth in Sportswear, Football and Basketball. DTC revenues increased 18% for the year, reflecting comp store sales growth, as well as the launch of NIKE.com. On a reported basis, results in Japan were significantly impacted by the weaker yen. For the year, revenue was down 12%, and EBIT fell 6% on a reported basis.\r\nIn our emerging markets geography, currency-neutral revenues grew 13% in FY '14, despite logistics issues in Mexico earlier in the year and generally weak macroeconomic conditions across Latin America.\r\nEvery key category, except Men's Training, posted higher revenues for the year paced by Football, Running and Sportswear. The geography finished the year strong with Q4 currency-neutral revenues up 25%, reflecting double-digit growth in nearly every territory and in most key categories.\r\nOn a reported basis, results in the emerging markets were also significantly affected by weaker currencies in a number of developing markets. FY '14 revenue grew 3% but EBIT fell 3%, as the FX headwinds eroded gross margins and generated losses on the other expense line. EBIT increased 8% in Q4, as stronger revenue growth was only partially offset by FX and World Cup demand creation investments.\r\nConverse continues to deliver strong growth, with revenue up 15% on a currency-neutral basis for both the fourth quarter and the full year. The growth was largely organic, driven by mid-teens revenue growth in Converse's direct distribution markets, particularly the United States, China and the U.K., as well as expansion of the Direct to Consumer business. For the year, reported revenue grew 16% and EBIT grew 17%, as gross margins expanded. Fourth quarter EBIT increased 6%, as higher revenue and gross margins were partially offset by investments in infrastructure, DTC and demand creation.\r\nNIKE delivered strong growth in FY '14, and we're beginning the new fiscal year with great momentum across our portfolio. Our FY '15 guidance reflects that momentum, as well as continued investments in growth drivers, such as DTC, product innovation and consumer digital, along with the operating capabilities to support our growth. Overall, our expectations for FY '15 are largely unchanged from what we shared last quarter. Specifically, for the year, we expect reported revenue to grow at a high single-digit rate, reflecting low double-digit currency-neutral growth, partially offset by continued FX pressure from developing market currencies. We expect Q1 reported revenue to grow at a low double-digit rate, driven by tremendous energy around the World Cup and continued growth in North America, Europe, China and the emerging markets.\r\nWe expect gross margin for Q1 and the full year to expand by about 75 basis points. We expect average selling prices to increase, driven by our ongoing focus on optimizing pricing and driving our product mix to premium. Growth in our DTC business should also benefit gross margin, helping to offset increases in product input costs, particularly labor.\r\nAs both Mark and Trevor discussed earlier, our growth strategies are working, and we'll continue to invest in them. For Q1, we expect demand creation to grow at approximately 30% as we continue to leverage the energy of the World Cup. Operating overhead for Q1 is expected to grow in the high teens, reflecting investments in innovation, consumer digital, DTC and key operating capabilities. For the full year, we expect total SG&A to grow at a similar rate as FY '14.\r\nFor FY '15, we expect the effective tax rate will be approximately 25%. As Mark said at the top of the call, by staying focused on consumer engagement and relentless innovation, we drive value for our shareholders. We're proud of the strong results we delivered in FY '14, and we're more confident than ever that we'll deliver sustainable, profitable growth and value for our shareholders. We're now ready to take your questions.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Kelley Hall (Executives)】\nThank you, operator. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss NIKE's fiscal 2014 fourth quarter results. As the operator indicated, participants on today's call may discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the appropriate reconciliations on our press release, which was issued about an hour ago, and at our website, investors.nikeinc.com.\r\nJoining us on today's call will be NIKE, Inc. President and CEO, Mark Parker; followed by Trevor Edwards, President of the NIKE Brand; and finally, you will hear from our Chief Financial Officer, Don Blair, who will give you an in-depth review of our financial results. Following their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. [Operator Instructions] With that, I'll now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc. President and CEO, Mark Parker.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Mark Parker (Executives)】\nThank you, Kelley, and hello, everybody. Fiscal '14 demonstrated a point I often make, and that's when we innovate, we just don't innovate for the sake of change. We innovate to change the game. And that's what we did throughout the year. We introduced great products, launched new consumer experiences, expanded our digital ecosystem and developed engaging retail concepts that drove excitement and energy for our brands in the marketplace.\r\nBy staying true to the NIKE spirit, we continued to deliver great results like those we're reporting today. Here are the fiscal '14 highlights.\r\nNIKE, Inc. revenues grew 10% to nearly $28 billion. Gross margin increased 120 basis points to 44.8%. SG&A rose 12%, reflecting continued strategic investments in our brands and operations. And despite significant currency pressure, diluted EPS rose 11% to $2.97 for the full year. We're proud of those results we delivered in fiscal '14, but more than that, we're proud of the consistent level of growth we've been able to deliver over the years.\r\nAs we continue to get bigger as a company, I'm often asked, how can NIKE continue to grow? Well, first and foremost, there's absolutely no shortage of growth opportunities for NIKE. This has never been as clear to me as it is today. When I look within and across our 5 brands, 6 geographies and 8 categories, I see tremendous untapped potential. And this includes areas where we can build on our current foundation, such as Apparel and Women's and Converse, as well as areas where we can extend our current leadership position, such as running, basketball and football.\r\nThe key to unlocking this potential is, and always has been, to focus on the consumer. Our relationship with the consumer is something we need to earn every day. Increasingly, this relationship is one-to-one through the lens of their favorite sport. This is why our category offense is such a powerful advantage. The insights we draw from our deep consumer connections fuel our ability to create new products and services that excite and engage.\r\nWe also know we need to remain nimble to meet the changing needs and expectations of those we serve globally. The world is becoming increasingly interconnected, and consumers expect companies to be able to deliver the same level of innovation everywhere. And that means continuing to elevate and accelerate our level of innovation in products, in services, in our supply chain and in our digital ecosystem.\r\nWe also know that when we focus on the consumer, we deliver value for our shareholders. We do this by ensuring our growth is profitable. The strength and diversity of the NIKE, Inc. portfolio allows us to manage the levers in our business to drive profitability and invest for the future, so we can continue to innovate to meet the expectations of our consumers. And that is what you saw in our fiscal '14 performance across all the elements of our business, and that is the virtuous cycle that fuels our success.\r\nOur unmatched ability to innovate is how we turn insights from athletes and consumers into amazing products and services that no one else can deliver. Throughout the past year, we used key events and sports moments to launch our most forward-thinking products. Together with Kobe in Los Angeles, we introduced the KOBE 9 Elite, the first basketball shoe to use our unique Flyknit technology. At the Sochi Winter Olympics, we leveraged significant advances from across our categories to deliver high-performance apparel, such as the lightweight hockey game jersey with Flywire and the Aeroloft Summit Jacket. In New York, at the Super Bowl, we launched the Vapor Carbon Elite Cleat, our first cleat to take advantage of the revolutionary potential of 3D printing. At the world's premier track meet, the Prefontaine Classic in Eugene, Oregon, NIKE athletes set new U.S. records and world's best times in our performance racing footwear.\r\nAnd throughout fiscal '14, we've built tremendous momentum for the business and the brand as we delivered an unprecedented level of innovation heading into the World Cup. The combination of the world's best players and teams, our most innovative performance products and new levels of consumer engagement through social media is truly extraordinary. It sets a new benchmark for NIKE and the industry. There's a lot more to share with you on our execution at World Cup, but I'll save that for Trevor to discuss.\r\nThe products we launched this year were the culmination of an intense period of creativity for us. But make no mistake, there is much more in the pipeline. In fact, this is the pace of innovation that you should expect from us. We know innovation is a long-term growth driver, and that is why we have been so focused on extending our investments in this area. And we're seeing clear returns on these investments. I recently completed a comprehensive look at our product development taking place in each of our categories. And as you know, I'm someone who lives and breathes innovation, and I've never been so -- seen so much potential. I can tell you that the scope and the scale of the innovations we will be delivering for our consumers is truly incredible.\r\nOur drive to innovate extends beyond product into areas such as digital. Our consumers expect us to be digitally connected as they are, making digital one of my top priorities for the company. Athletes are demanding more real-time personalized feedback on their performance. They want easy access to products and services that will help them improve, and they want to be part of a community where they can share and compare information, find performance tips and motivate each other. We are building an integrated system of digital services that will provide seamless access to our products, a full array of services and the most advanced digital tools to measure, motivate and inspire. Delivered with the soul of sport, this will be the digital platform for lifetime consumer relationships. Our goal is to grow the Nike+ community from tens of millions to hundreds of millions of members.\r\nAn ongoing 2-way dialogue with consumers is also a critical element of our digital ecosystem. It provides us insights that drive innovation, strengthens consumers' connections to our brands and provides a platform for consumers to interact with each other. Through our social media platforms, we leverage the power and passion of sport to deepen our relationship with our consumers. A perfect example of this is our Risk Everything campaign, which celebrates the energy and enthusiasm of Global Football. Two of the campaign's videos, Winner Stays and The Last Game, have set new records for engagement with over 370 million digital views and growing.\r\nAnd finally, in e-commerce, we've made significant investments in infrastructure, capabilities and geographic expansion to provide a better experience. We know that when consumers shop online, they want a seamless premium experience. And that's our goal for NIKE.com. Our efforts are paying off. Our online business grew over 40% in fiscal '14, with the growth rate accelerating every quarter throughout the year.\r\nWhen all 3 elements of our digital ecosystem come together, it's a powerful strategy to drive growth and meet and exceed the expectations of our consumers around the world, and its potential is enormous. It is changing how we conduct our business, tell our stories and engage consumers. It's a big part of our future and will only get bigger and better.\r\nFiscal '14 has been another strong year for us, and we will take that momentum into fiscal '15. We've aligned our leadership and resources to fully leverage those opportunities with the greatest potential for growth. With our deep consumer connections and our obsessive drive to innovate, we will excite, inspire and, no doubt, surprise. That's what you should expect from NIKE in fiscal '15 and beyond.\r\nSo thanks, and now here's Trevor to discuss the NIKE Brand.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Trevor Edwards (Executives)】\nThanks, Mark. The NIKE Brand had a strong finish to a great year, one that confirms the tremendous confidence that we have in our long-term growth strategy. Looking at the results, on a constant currency basis, NIKE Brand revenue grew 13% for the quarter. For the year, revenue was up 11%, with growth across all key categories and geographies. NIKE Brand's DTC revenue was up 27% for the quarter, with 22% for the year, putting DTC revenue past the $5 billion mark. Results for the year were driven by comp store growth of 10%, new store expansion and online sales growth of 42%. And finally, global futures are up 12%.\r\nAs always, these results can be attributed to NIKE's unrivaled ability to understand the consumer, what they need and what inspires them. That knowledge drives us to identify the biggest growth opportunities and align our resources against them. Let me highlight 3 areas of the business where we've seen significant revenue expansion on a wholesale equivalent basis, clearly demonstrating the power of our consumer focus.\r\nFirst, I'll start with Global Football, which in fiscal year '14 grew 21% to $2.3 billion, and that doesn't even include our Football Sportswear product. Now I've been to Brazil many times over the past 20 years, but having just returned from Rio, I have to say I have never seen energy like that before. There's a tremendous passion for football across the country. At NIKE, our connection with Brazil is powerful. We've been there for years, and we'll be there long after the World Cup ends.\r\nThe enthusiasm we see in Brazil, coupled with our #1 footwear market share around the world, is living proof that our Football business has never been stronger, and the power of the category offense continues to fuel growth in Football, with superior executions against engaging consumer connections, innovative products and premium retail destinations.\r\nWe bring the game's passion to footballers worldwide by creating meaningful connections with them through unique events and experiences. A great example of our series -- is our series of phenomenal houses, which combine product trials, athlete appearances, football tournaments in an immersive NIKE experience. Over the last 10 weeks, the phenom houses in Rio, London and New York and many other cities hosted more than 50,000 fans and thousands more played in our Winner Stays football tournaments around the globe.\r\nAs Mark mentioned, we are incredibly proud of our successful Risk Everything campaign. For years, we've taken inspiration from the best footballers. And as we always do, we share that inspiration in the stories we tell. That kind of engaging storytelling energizes current football fans and brings new fans in, growing the market today and into the future.\r\nWe also developed an incredible number of innovative football products this year, which led up to the first match in Rio. With the most teams in the tournament, we launched 10 new team kits, achieving a new milestone in performance and sustainability. We introduced 4 groundbreaking performance boots: the Hypervenom, the Tiempo V, the Magista and Mercurial Superfly. Both the Magista and the Mercurial use our transformative Flyknit technology to take football boots to a whole new level. The players' response to these boots has been tremendous. There are more players wearing NIKE boots in the World Cup than all other brands combined, and more than 1/3 of them are playing in the distinctive and revolutionary Magista or Mercurial Flyknit boots.\r\nAnd finally, we're seeing great excitement at retail, as NIKE Football has helped drive great results in our stores, online and at football shops with our wholesale partners around the world.\r\nOur comprehensive offense on the pitch and in the marketplace drives our leadership as the world's best football brand and positions us for growth in this category for years to come.\r\nNext, I'd like to talk about Running, which is also driven by product innovation, consumer engagement and retail presentation. It's that focus that powers us, growing revenue 10% for the year to $4.6 billion. Our results were driven by key product innovations like Free Flyknit footwear, Dri-FIT Touch and Aeroloft apparel, just to name a few. And we're expanding the business by connecting with a new generation of runners. In Q4 alone, we engaged with over 85,000 runners through events and millions more via the Nike+ platform. That energy directly translates at retail worldwide, in our DTC locations and running destinations like Crosstown Running at JD Sports and the NIKE Track Club at the Finish Line. The consistent achievement in the Running category confirms the strength of our strategy and points to the massive potential we see for Running going forward.\r\nAnd third, our Women's business continues to drive strong growth. For the year, the Women's revenue grew 12% to nearly $5 billion, moving us closer to our goal of $7 billion by fiscal year '17. Our women's strategy is very clear, to combine running, training and sportswear into compelling product assortments that women want to run, train and live in, with key styles like the Legend Tights, the NIKE Pro Bras and the Sky Hi Dunks are a must-have for her. Our goal to elevate women's product distribution this year was a success. As we brought the energy of the Nike Training Club app to life at retail. We blended 3 vital components, pinnacle product assortments, premium services and great shopping experiences, that clearly demonstrate that NIKE understands this consumer's needs.\r\nThe 50-plus stores where we've executed these concepts have been outpacing comp store growth for the next -- for the rest of the fleet. Our success in fiscal year '14 only hints at the enormous opportunity we see in the Women's business, and we are completely focused on capturing it.\r\nNow let's shift focus onto a few of our key geographies. North America had another great quarter and posted a record year. Revenues were up 10% for the quarter and the year, helping North America surpass $12 billion in annual revenue. The geography also had its most profitable year ever, with reported EBIT expanding faster than reported revenue to reach $3 billion for the year.\r\nFor the last decade, we've heard that our opportunities in North America are tapped out. But as we continue to demonstrate, nothing could be further from the truth. So how do we do it? We expand the market and, at the same time, we take market share by understanding the consumer better than anyone else. We extend our leadership on our perennial strengths like the Basketball and Running categories. This expertise also gives us insight to capitalize on the significant growth opportunities like in e-commerce and in our Apparel, Women's and Young Athletes businesses, just to name a few. And as we've often discussed, our confidence in the category offense in North America gives us the roadmap to continue to unlock opportunities in this geography and around the world.\r\nNow let's turn to the emerging markets, which delivered exceptional Q4 results, with revenue up 25%. These results were very well balanced, with double-digit growth in almost every territory and increased revenues in nearly every key category. The Q4 results in our emerging markets demonstrated that our brand and products resonate with consumers in every corner of the globe. It was a great way to end a year that had some challenges. As we've talked about previously, we had logistics issues in Mexico in the first half of the year. This, combined with increased macroeconomic headwinds across Latin America, slowed revenue growth for the geography in fiscal year '14. We're continuing to closely monitor retailer inventory and the flow of product into Mexico and across Latin America to ensure the marketplace and our brand stay healthy.\r\nNow onto China, where we had one overarching goal for fiscal year '14, reset the marketplace for growth. We've made great progress, and we're on track to achieve our goal of returning this market to sustainable double-digit revenue growth. In our DTC doors, we tested and deployed new merchandising concepts, which drove Q4 comp store sales up 22%, with continued increases in profitability. We've also tightened our merchandise assortments for our wholesale partners and reprofiled hundreds of the NIKE-only stores they operate. As a result, comp store sales and profitability for their overall fleet are up, with the reprofiled stores significantly outperforming.\r\nAnd importantly, inventory levels in the marketplace are also down significantly. While we still have work to do in China, we're making great progress, and we remain confident that we have the right plan in place to achieve our true potential in this growth geography.\r\nAnd finally, there's the outstanding results we're seeing in Western Europe. Q4 revenue grew 18%, a truly remarkable finish to an incredible year, as revenues in this important geography increased 14% to nearly $5 billion for the year, with growth across all key categories and nearly every territory. The success we're seeing today in Western Europe stems from decisions we made more than 2 years ago to align our teams against the biggest growth opportunities through the category offense.\r\nWe fueled growth in fiscal year '14 by transforming the marketplace, with shop-in-shops at JD Sports, Foot Locker and Intersport, as well as our own retail stores and online. And we've only just gotten started. There are tremendous opportunities for continued growth ahead. By being focused and decisive, we now lead the market as the region's most coveted sports brand. NIKE is the #1 brand in each of the top 10 cities in Western Europe, and we're the footwear market share leader in every key country. And we're not done yet.\r\nAs we start a new fiscal year, we will continue to do what we do best: lead. Lead with the world's best innovative products and services, inspired by the greatest athletes; lead by connecting with consumers who share our passion for sport; and lead by energizing the marketplace with superior experiences at retail and online across the world.\r\nThere is no doubt about it, the momentum surrounding NIKE makes me incredibly excited about what's to come.\r\nThanks. Now here's Don.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Donald Blair (Executives)】\nThanks, Trevor. Our FY '14 results continue to demonstrate our ability to leverage our diversified portfolio to drive sustainable profitable growth. We're able to consistently deliver results like these for 3 key reasons. First, we invest effectively to build our business. The category offense is the framework for our growth strategy. And as Mark and Trevor described earlier, we're delivering outstanding value to consumers on each component of that framework: product, brand and marketplace. The results were clearly on display in FY '14. We continue to drive remarkable growth in North America, and we've significantly accelerated our business in both of our European geographies.\r\nUsing the learnings gathered in more developed markets, we're making great progress resetting China, while continuing to build our brands and our business in the emerging markets. Within all of those geographies, our Direct to Consumer operations are the sharp point, delivering strong growth in revenue and profits, while setting a benchmark for our brand and our business in-store and online.\r\nAnd beyond the Swoosh, we're continuing to build the Converse, Jordan and Hurley brands, reaching toward the enormous potential they each offer. The results we're reporting today flow directly from the investments we've made over the past several years, and we're confident the investments we're making today will continue to drive sustainable profitable growth well into the future.\r\nSecond, we work hard to maintain balance across growth and profitability, investments and returns, near-term and long-term results. The breadth and depth of the NIKE portfolio gives us the opportunity to invest for the future while delivering strong growth and expanding returns on capital. And that's important for us to compete effectively and to continue to deliver value for our shareholders.\r\nAnd the third reason we deliver consistent growth is that we effectively manage risk. In FY '14, we delivered 11% growth in EPS, despite losing 8 points of growth to currency headwinds. Our ability to deliver in a volatile environment demonstrates that we can pull the levers of our business to mitigate unforeseen downsides.\r\nWith that context, I'll recap our Q4 and fiscal 2014 results. NIKE, Inc. fourth quarter revenue grew 11% on a reported basis and 13% on a currency-neutral basis, bringing our revenue to $27.8 billion for the year, up 10% as reported and up 11% on a currency-neutral basis.\r\nNIKE Brand futures orders advanced 12% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by an 8% increase in units and a 4% rise in average selling price. Growth was led by continued strength in North America and Europe, even as our futures window moved beyond the World Cup. On a reported basis, futures grew 11%, reflecting weaker international currencies, particularly in Japan and developing markets such as Brazil, Argentina, Russia and Turkey.\r\nFourth quarter diluted EPS increased 3% to $0.78, bringing full year EPS to $2.97, up 11% versus last year. Strong revenue growth, gross margin expansion and a lower share count more than offset SG&A investments and currency headwinds to drive EPS growth for the quarter and the year.\r\nAs discussed on our previous call, our SG&A was more concentrated in the fourth quarter, primarily reflecting demand creation investments behind the World Cup.\r\nWe estimate the changes in currency exchange rates, including the impact on gross margin, other expense and P&L translation, reduced our year-on-year EPS growth by 7 percentage points for the fourth quarter and 8 percentage points for the full year.\r\nGross margin increased 170 basis points for the fourth quarter and 120 basis points for the year. The expansion for both periods was primarily driven by higher average prices, reflecting the power of innovative products and strong brands, as well as the continued strength of our DTC business. These upsides more than offset downward pressure from product cost inflation and FX headwinds.\r\nGross margin for the quarter was better than expected, mainly due to the strong performance of our growing DTC business, a mix shift to higher-margin product and higher margins on closeout sales.\r\nAs we expected, Q4 demand creation spending was significantly higher than last year, driven by marketing investments in the World Cup and key product initiatives. Full year demand creation grew 10%, in line with our full year revenue growth, largely driven by an increase in sports marketing expense as well as marketing for global sporting events and new product launches.\r\nOperating overhead grew 13% for the quarter and 14% for the full year. This reflected support for key growth initiatives such as DTC and consumer digital, as well as infrastructure investments to support NIKE's current and future growth. Other expense, net, was $17 million for the quarter and $103 million for the fiscal year, driven largely by foreign exchange losses, primarily from developing markets.\r\nThe fourth quarter effective tax rate was 23.5%, higher than last year's 22.9% rate, which benefited from a reduction in tax reserves related to foreign operations. For the full year, our effective tax rate was 24%, a 70-basis-point improvement over the prior year, primarily due to an increase in earnings from lower tax jurisdictions.\r\nWe continue to deliver strong returns on capital in FY '14, as ROIC reached 24.5%, 70 basis points above last year. For the year, we delivered $2.1 billion in free cash flow and returned $3.4 billion in cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends.\r\nAs of May 31, inventories were up 13%, a somewhat faster rate of growth than revenue or futures. Our inventories are healthy in most markets, reflecting builds to support the World Cup and to optimize the flow of goods in Europe and China. We are continuing to work through higher inventories in Latin America, particularly Mexico, as a result of the distribution center issues we experienced earlier in the year.\r\nNow let's look at our performance by segment. North America delivered a great year, as revenues grew 10% to $12.3 billion, marking the fourth consecutive year of double-digit revenue growth. For the fourth quarter, revenue also grew 10%, led by double-digit growth in Basketball and Global Football.\r\nIn Q4, DTC revenue grew 21%, driven by an 8% increase in comp store sales and significantly higher NIKE.com revenues. For the year, EBIT for North America grew 16%, as strong top line growth and gross margin expansion were partially offset by higher DTC operating costs and demand creation.\r\nAs Trevor described earlier, Western Europe also had a fantastic year, as revenue reached nearly $5 billion, up 14% on a currency-neutral basis. Fourth quarter revenues grew 18%. FY '14 reported revenue for Western Europe grew 19%, while EBIT increased 33%, driven by revenue growth, gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage, as well as FX benefits from the stronger euro.\r\nIn Central and Eastern Europe, currency-neutral revenues increased 12% in Q4 and 15% for the year, with growth in every key category except Action Sports, and every territory except Israel.\r\nFootball, Running and Women's Training were the fastest-growing categories, with each reporting growth of 20% or greater for the quarter and the year. Russia, Turkey, Poland and Greece each reported double-digit growth for the year.\r\nOn a reported basis, FY '14 revenue grew 13% and EBIT grew 19%, reflecting revenue growth and expanding gross margins. In Q4, EBIT fell 10%, as stiff FX headwinds and SG&A investments more than offset higher revenues.\r\nIn Greater China, currency-neutral revenue grew 2% for the quarter and 3% for the year, led by strong DTC growth.\r\nFor the year, reported revenue increased 5%, while EBIT was flat, as revenue growth and gross margin expansion were offset by higher SG&A, reflecting investments in DTC and our new headquarters in Shanghai. In Q4, EBIT fell 12%, largely reflecting the timing of demand creation and operational investments.\r\nAs Trevor noted, we're seeing great results from the actions we're taking to reset the China market for renewed growth. For FY '15, we expect revenue for the geography to grow at a high single-digit rate. As we've discussed before, we expect quarterly growth will vary as we fine-tune the seasonal flow of product into the market and given the significant variations in prior-year comparisons. We expect those factors will drive somewhat-faster revenue growth in the first quarter.\r\nIn Japan, currency-neutral revenues were flat in Q4 but up 5% for the year, driven by growth in Sportswear, Football and Basketball. DTC revenues increased 18% for the year, reflecting comp store sales growth, as well as the launch of NIKE.com. On a reported basis, results in Japan were significantly impacted by the weaker yen. For the year, revenue was down 12%, and EBIT fell 6% on a reported basis.\r\nIn our emerging markets geography, currency-neutral revenues grew 13% in FY '14, despite logistics issues in Mexico earlier in the year and generally weak macroeconomic conditions across Latin America.\r\nEvery key category, except Men's Training, posted higher revenues for the year paced by Football, Running and Sportswear. The geography finished the year strong with Q4 currency-neutral revenues up 25%, reflecting double-digit growth in nearly every territory and in most key categories.\r\nOn a reported basis, results in the emerging markets were also significantly affected by weaker currencies in a number of developing markets. FY '14 revenue grew 3% but EBIT fell 3%, as the FX headwinds eroded gross margins and generated losses on the other expense line. EBIT increased 8% in Q4, as stronger revenue growth was only partially offset by FX and World Cup demand creation investments.\r\nConverse continues to deliver strong growth, with revenue up 15% on a currency-neutral basis for both the fourth quarter and the full year. The growth was largely organic, driven by mid-teens revenue growth in Converse's direct distribution markets, particularly the United States, China and the U.K., as well as expansion of the Direct to Consumer business. For the year, reported revenue grew 16% and EBIT grew 17%, as gross margins expanded. Fourth quarter EBIT increased 6%, as higher revenue and gross margins were partially offset by investments in infrastructure, DTC and demand creation.\r\nNIKE delivered strong growth in FY '14, and we're beginning the new fiscal year with great momentum across our portfolio. Our FY '15 guidance reflects that momentum, as well as continued investments in growth drivers, such as DTC, product innovation and consumer digital, along with the operating capabilities to support our growth. Overall, our expectations for FY '15 are largely unchanged from what we shared last quarter. Specifically, for the year, we expect reported revenue to grow at a high single-digit rate, reflecting low double-digit currency-neutral growth, partially offset by continued FX pressure from developing market currencies. We expect Q1 reported revenue to grow at a low double-digit rate, driven by tremendous energy around the World Cup and continued growth in North America, Europe, China and the emerging markets.\r\nWe expect gross margin for Q1 and the full year to expand by about 75 basis points. We expect average selling prices to increase, driven by our ongoing focus on optimizing pricing and driving our product mix to premium. Growth in our DTC business should also benefit gross margin, helping to offset increases in product input costs, particularly labor.\r\nAs both Mark and Trevor discussed earlier, our growth strategies are working, and we'll continue to invest in them. For Q1, we expect demand creation to grow at approximately 30% as we continue to leverage the energy of the World Cup. Operating overhead for Q1 is expected to grow in the high teens, reflecting investments in innovation, consumer digital, DTC and key operating capabilities. For the full year, we expect total SG&A to grow at a similar rate as FY '14.\r\nFor FY '15, we expect the effective tax rate will be approximately 25%. As Mark said at the top of the call, by staying focused on consumer engagement and relentless innovation, we drive value for our shareholders. We're proud of the strong results we delivered in FY '14, and we're more confident than ever that we'll deliver sustainable, profitable growth and value for our shareholders. We're now ready to take your questions.",
      "transcript_text3": "Just one quick question on guidance. I think, Don, on the last call, you had said for fiscal year '15, you had expected slightly below a mid-teens EPS growth rate. Is the guidance and the line items you gave today implying that same guidance?\n\n---\n\nWell, Kate, as you know, it's not been our practice to regularly give EPS guidance, but we do give you parameters on key line items. And I would point you back to the guidance that we gave in the prepared remarks, and that's where I'd like to leave it for now.\n\n---\n\nAnd Kate, you can give a call into my team, we'll walk you through it.\n\n---\n\nOkay, great. And then my second question is on share buybacks. It looks like this quarter, you've bought back more on a dollar basis than you ever have in your history. How should we think about buybacks going forward?\n\n---\n\nWell, overall, our strategy, as you know, is to continuously increase the level of cash returns to shareholders. And as you know, we've done that very consistently with our dividend, and we do create our share repurchase program based upon analysis of value of the company and market conditions. So over the long haul, what we would expect is that we would continue to deliver more cash back to shareholders. The specific timing of that is based upon our assessment of the marketplace. But we're confident in our ability to continue to generate sustainable profitable growth, and we think NIKE is a good investment.\n\n---\n\nTwo questions: one on China, one on supply chain. When it comes to China, it's really great to hear that you got a store format that seems to be -- really be working. Now that you've got this kind of -- this DTC format there that works, are you going to reprofile the partner stores? Are you going to shut down some of the partner stores there? Any sort of deeper-dive explanation about the retail strategy there would be helpful. And then my supply chain question, on the supply chain revolution really, are you starting to see gross margin benefits from some of those activities? I mean, Flyknit's really starting to get larger in size. Or is that really all going to come in terms of the margin benefits of some of the new supply chain innovations?\n\n---\n\nOkay, yes. Omar, I'll take the first one. Yes, around China, yes, obviously, we're seeing -- we are seeing great results in the stores that we've reprofiled. So we clearly feel that the reset strategy is working. What we're looking to do is continue to expand the number of stores that we actually reprofile, and so that we can continue to actually scale the results. Right now, it still represents a smaller part of our entire business, but we do believe that by reprofiling more doors, we will continue to actually build the business in the right way. So again, we feel very confident about where we are today. We will accelerate at a faster pace as we kind of come out, but we certainly feel very confident in what we've been doing.\n\n---\n\nAnd just to be clear, Omar, when we say reprofiling stores, it's not just the physical format. It's also the way we assort the stores. And to Trevor's earlier point, this is already in a number of stores with our partners, not just in DTC; and those partners are seeing great results both in terms of sales result, as well as margin. So with respect to your second question, to take the financial part of the question, we are still very early days in terms of seeing the impact of some of the more transformational approaches to manufacturing. We are starting to proliferate that into our sourcing base, but we think there's huge opportunity going forward on that.\n\n---\n\nYes. I'll just add, Omar, that we're very committed to modernizing our manufacturing and really focusing on innovation with some key partners to transform the whole process. There's lots of opportunities, I think, to reduce product costs. And we're focused on the ones that we think have the most potential to make an impact, so we're very selective as to where we can innovate and how we can scale those innovations. Flyknit, you mentioned, has enormous potential. We're getting tremendous response to that product. We're improving or extending the scope of Flyknit across multiple categories. I think you will see over the next couple of fiscal years, Flyknit and some of the other investments we're making in manufacturing innovation really start to make a more sizable impact on our product cost reduction. And that will only continue to get bigger and stronger, I think, in the fiscal years to come. We're very bullish on this, and it's a really important part of our strategy to contain product cost and then advance the innovation in our product at the same time.\n\n---\n\nThe first question I have is around the FX and the currency hedging losses. Don, how should we model that or think about that? I think it came in a little bit below the expectation this quarter at least, and just sort of how to think about it for '15 from a modeling perspective? And I guess, similarly on those -- that line, like, can you just elaborate a little bit more how you're managing the risk in some of the emerging market volatility that you're seeing right now from a business standpoint, as well as an FX standpoint?\n\n---\n\nSure. So I'm going to leave -- need to leave the conversation around modeling with our IR folks, because it all depends upon the individual who's doing the modeling. But as far as the way we manage this, we do have a pretty robust hedging program for the developed market currencies. Because normally, those are the largest impacts on our business, and it's relatively economical to do those sorts of hedges. For a lot of the other currencies, we've done quite a bit of work in the last few years, developing natural offsets to some of the exposure by purchasing in multiple currencies. And so as a result, we've reduced our overall volatility. But there's a baseline level of volatility, especially in the developing world like Brazil, Argentina, Russia, Turkey, that just is not economical to eliminate through the use of a hedging program. So unfortunately, we are going to see some of that volatility flow into our numbers. With that said, we have a very diversified portfolio of businesses. And just as you saw in FY '14, we have a lot of levers to pull, and we were able to deliver double-digit growth in EPS, even though we absorbed 8 points of FX headwind for the year.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then, I guess, my second question is a lot of talk on the World Cup and the product offering, I just wondered if any of you guys would share your predictions for the winner?\n\n---\n\nWe just hope that the best teams win.\n\n---\n\nMy question is on North America. I get this question a lot. How -- can you give us a little bit more of a map on how you are going to keep the North America momentum going? Is it more price increases? Is it an acceleration in store growth? Internet? Is it more leaning on Women's growth acceleration? Just maybe a little more color on how you guys expect to keep that going through the next year or 2.\n\n---\n\nAbsolutely. It's a question that -- we clearly always get that same question, and the thing that we would continue to say is that we see great momentum in North America today. Our futures growth of 11% continues to demonstrate that we can continue to leverage the category offense to continue to grow the brand and the overall market. One of the key things that we've certainly learned is by drilling down against any of the opportunities in the category, we can continue to grow. So we see great growth coming from the categories that are currently our perennial categories, as I talked about earlier. Whether that's Running, that's Basketball, those obviously are our key categories, which will see growth, and we'll see Sportswear grow. In addition, we see great growth coming from the other categories, such as our Women's business, our Young Athletes business, as well as e-commerce. So those are all very underpenetrated opportunities. So we look at the North America, and we see just tremendous growth potential in the marketplace. Overall, our -- also we have our focus with our key retail partners around continuing to transform the marketplace, so we can increase the capacity in that marketplace, which we are certainly seeing great success from doing that today. So all in all, we still see tremendous ways to grow. E-commerce, Young Athletes, Women's, Apparel, all of those represent really great opportunities for us to grow, in addition to the current and expected businesses where we're doing well today.\n\n---\n\nYes, I'll just quickly add that the -- we have a sizable investment in -- ongoing investment in DTC, and that's not just to create more premium points of distribution. It's actually to help us elevate our business and how we manage our brand in North America, certainly, and then around the world. We're getting better, I think, at retail presentation, consumer experiences, storytelling, merchandising, product flow, assortment planning. These are the things that you have to do just to be a better brand and a better business. And so we're leveraging that investment in DTC to really drive more potential in North America. But then also it's a -- really a blueprint for expanding our business around the world.\n\n---\n\nSo I was looking for a little more color on your long-term gross margin drivers. So I think the key drivers that you've talked about in the past are a shift to -- are a geographic shift outside of the North America, a shift from Footwear to Apparel and then also a shift to DTC. It feels like the DTC is what's helping the most right now. Can you just kind of confirm if that's the case? And if it is, maybe provide a little color about when maybe the shift to apparel and the geographic gross margin shift may start to contribute to the overall gross margin gains as well, if they're not already?\n\n---\n\nOkay. Well, let me just start with the biggest drivers. I mean, certainly, we start with the top line. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we have done quite a bit of work around our consumer value equation. And one of the things that the strength of our brand and the innovation that's in our products means that there's a great consumer value proposition at higher price points. So certainly, working to optimize that price-value equation, we think we can continue to raise prices, particularly around product innovation and brand strength. And then the second thing is migrating consumers to premium product. So that is definitely a trend we've seen both on the Footwear and the Apparel side. The second one is really making sure that we are working that product-cost equation. And as Mark indicated earlier, there's a whole range of supply chain and manufacturing initiatives that plays all the way from the evolutionary to the revolutionary. And the objective there is to raise the productivity of labor, to reduce waste of materials, and produce even more premium product and we're driving hard against those. DTC is certainly a positive driver for us, and our DTC business is -- has increased significantly in profitability as we've driven our dot-com business and also as we've gotten better and better, as Mark indicated, at operating retail. So all of those are key drivers. They were key drivers in '14. We expect them to be key drivers again in '15 and going forward.\n\n---\n\nMark, I just had a question about the reset going on in China. Can you just walk us through the strategic decision-making process for thinking about whether to prioritize investment and distribution into NIKE.com versus investment in brick-and-mortar retail, whether it's your own or wholesale partners -- or sorry, retail partners.\n\n---\n\nWell, we're actually investing in both. We're -- as you've heard us talk about quite a bit, we're investing in elevating the presentation of NIKE at retail, looking at how we can improve our ability to create a more profitable, more focused business,  raise the level of execution against the categories. It's really imperative that we not only learn how to do that ourselves in that market, but actually help to leverage those learnings through our retail partners. So the physical retail investments we're making in China are absolutely critical. I'm really excited about what has transpired over this past year and then our ability through '15 and beyond to start to scale those learnings across both our own retail and our wholesale partners. Certainly, we're very bullish on dot-com, dot-com not only in China, but around the world. We think that that's just going to continue to be a bigger and bigger percentage of our business going forward. And China is certainly no exception, very digitally connected country, consumer. And that channel for us -- that medium for commerce is absolutely the future. So we're going to be as bullish out there as we possibly can.\n\n---\n\nYes, and the one thing I'd also underline from an economic standpoint is our focus is on productivity and profitability of retail. So for us, from a return standpoint, this is really driving more revenue, more profitability through a given size of distribution infrastructure, which is not to say we won't expand over time, but the strategy is not adding lots of new stores in lower-tier cities here. We're really focused on making our existing base more profitable, more productive for us and for our retailers.\n\n---\n\nAnd one other thing too, as Mark just mentioned, in China specifically, last quarter, we actually went in and upgraded our entire NIKE.com site in our China business. And that, again, is one of those things as we continue to transform that marketplace using all the investments that we put in place, we're now leveraging that in China specifically. So I think you'll see that play out in the future as that continues to grow.\n\n---\n\nTrevor, in your prepared remarks, you referenced the momentum on the Women's side. I was wondering if -- is that more of a U.S. phenomenon? Are you seeing that trending elsewhere? And then in terms of the growth that you're seeing there, is it more on the Apparel side than Footwear? Is it more DTC than wholesale? Just any color on that would be helpful.\n\n---\n\nYes, certainly. Yes -- no, we absolutely see just great momentum in the Women's business. Actually, it's not only in North America but actually across all the geographies. We're seeing great growth as we've gone in, and certainly, we're seeing really a strong brand position. All the work that we've done around the Nike Training app has really helped to unlock a connection with our female consumer. We continue to bring really great products and premium products into the marketplace, and so she's very obviously excited about that. And then thirdly, what we're also doing is around distribution. We've been able to go in and work at our DTC doors to use them, as Don says, as a sharp point to better understand that consumer and then roll that strategy out with our wholesale partners. Now in terms of Footwear and Apparel, actually, we're seeing growth in both -- on both dimensions. Certainly, our Footwear on both Running -- from Running to Training, to actually Sportswear and certainly around Apparel, we're seeing great growth in the Women's Training apparel, as well as in Women's Running apparel. So again, just tremendous upside here, and I think going forward, you're going to see us put a lot more focus on this part of the business because we truly believe this is an area where we can be very successful and then we see great opportunity.\n\n---\n\nI'll add too that the Women's business on the dot-com side has been incredibly healthy as well, and we expect that to continue through '15 and beyond. And that's a real focal point for us on the Women's side is that dot-com's business -- dot-com business. And then the futures on our Women's business are actually very, very healthy as well. So we see a lot of momentum going into fiscal year '15.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then real quickly in Western Europe, I mean, a lot of momentum there. You talked about some of the strategies that you have placed in that market. I'm also wondering, how much of a factor is the -- is an economic recovery there? I mean, is it mostly that you're taking share through some of these strategies or are you also benefiting from somewhat of a tailwind from economic recovery?\n\n---\n\nI think from our side, we're certainly seeing just broad-based growth across all of the Western European marketplace. And that, we truly believe, is a function of the reset that we did 2 years ago when we decided to really focus against the category offense, as well as have a more centralized approach to the European marketplace. So we've seen great growth really across all the territories. And even in the Iberia, so the southern parts where it was struggling, we're certainly seeing strength in those zones coming back. So we really truly believe our category offense is what's driving that, and we -- we're seeing the numbers actually go really ahead of any economic recovery. So we feel very strong that it's really about our approach in that market, and we think we've only just gotten started. We think there is just tremendous growth continuing to come through.\n\n---\n\nGreat. Well, thank you, everybody. Appreciate you joining us for our year-end call today, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Kate McShane (Analysts)】\nJust one quick question on guidance. I think, Don, on the last call, you had said for fiscal year '15, you had expected slightly below a mid-teens EPS growth rate. Is the guidance and the line items you gave today implying that same guidance?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Donald Blair (Executives)】\nWell, Kate, as you know, it's not been our practice to regularly give EPS guidance, but we do give you parameters on key line items. And I would point you back to the guidance that we gave in the prepared remarks, and that's where I'd like to leave it for now.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kelley Hall (Executives)】\nAnd Kate, you can give a call into my team, we'll walk you through it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kate McShane (Analysts)】\nOkay, great. And then my second question is on share buybacks. It looks like this quarter, you've bought back more on a dollar basis than you ever have in your history. How should we think about buybacks going forward?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Donald Blair (Executives)】\nWell, overall, our strategy, as you know, is to continuously increase the level of cash returns to shareholders. And as you know, we've done that very consistently with our dividend, and we do create our share repurchase program based upon analysis of value of the company and market conditions. So over the long haul, what we would expect is that we would continue to deliver more cash back to shareholders. The specific timing of that is based upon our assessment of the marketplace. But we're confident in our ability to continue to generate sustainable profitable growth, and we think NIKE is a good investment.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Omar Saad (Analysts)】\nTwo questions: one on China, one on supply chain. When it comes to China, it's really great to hear that you got a store format that seems to be -- really be working. Now that you've got this kind of -- this DTC format there that works, are you going to reprofile the partner stores? Are you going to shut down some of the partner stores there? Any sort of deeper-dive explanation about the retail strategy there would be helpful. And then my supply chain question, on the supply chain revolution really, are you starting to see gross margin benefits from some of those activities? I mean, Flyknit's really starting to get larger in size. Or is that really all going to come in terms of the margin benefits of some of the new supply chain innovations?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Trevor Edwards (Executives)】\nOkay, yes. Omar, I'll take the first one. Yes, around China, yes, obviously, we're seeing -- we are seeing great results in the stores that we've reprofiled. So we clearly feel that the reset strategy is working. What we're looking to do is continue to expand the number of stores that we actually reprofile, and so that we can continue to actually scale the results. Right now, it still represents a smaller part of our entire business, but we do believe that by reprofiling more doors, we will continue to actually build the business in the right way. So again, we feel very confident about where we are today. We will accelerate at a faster pace as we kind of come out, but we certainly feel very confident in what we've been doing.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Donald Blair (Executives)】\nAnd just to be clear, Omar, when we say reprofiling stores, it's not just the physical format. It's also the way we assort the stores. And to Trevor's earlier point, this is already in a number of stores with our partners, not just in DTC; and those partners are seeing great results both in terms of sales result, as well as margin. So with respect to your second question, to take the financial part of the question, we are still very early days in terms of seeing the impact of some of the more transformational approaches to manufacturing. We are starting to proliferate that into our sourcing base, but we think there's huge opportunity going forward on that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Parker (Executives)】\nYes. I'll just add, Omar, that we're very committed to modernizing our manufacturing and really focusing on innovation with some key partners to transform the whole process. There's lots of opportunities, I think, to reduce product costs. And we're focused on the ones that we think have the most potential to make an impact, so we're very selective as to where we can innovate and how we can scale those innovations. Flyknit, you mentioned, has enormous potential. We're getting tremendous response to that product. We're improving or extending the scope of Flyknit across multiple categories. I think you will see over the next couple of fiscal years, Flyknit and some of the other investments we're making in manufacturing innovation really start to make a more sizable impact on our product cost reduction. And that will only continue to get bigger and stronger, I think, in the fiscal years to come. We're very bullish on this, and it's a really important part of our strategy to contain product cost and then advance the innovation in our product at the same time.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Drbul (Analysts)】\nThe first question I have is around the FX and the currency hedging losses. Don, how should we model that or think about that? I think it came in a little bit below the expectation this quarter at least, and just sort of how to think about it for '15 from a modeling perspective? And I guess, similarly on those -- that line, like, can you just elaborate a little bit more how you're managing the risk in some of the emerging market volatility that you're seeing right now from a business standpoint, as well as an FX standpoint?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Donald Blair (Executives)】\nSure. So I'm going to leave -- need to leave the conversation around modeling with our IR folks, because it all depends upon the individual who's doing the modeling. But as far as the way we manage this, we do have a pretty robust hedging program for the developed market currencies. Because normally, those are the largest impacts on our business, and it's relatively economical to do those sorts of hedges. For a lot of the other currencies, we've done quite a bit of work in the last few years, developing natural offsets to some of the exposure by purchasing in multiple currencies. And so as a result, we've reduced our overall volatility. But there's a baseline level of volatility, especially in the developing world like Brazil, Argentina, Russia, Turkey, that just is not economical to eliminate through the use of a hedging program. So unfortunately, we are going to see some of that volatility flow into our numbers. With that said, we have a very diversified portfolio of businesses. And just as you saw in FY '14, we have a lot of levers to pull, and we were able to deliver double-digit growth in EPS, even though we absorbed 8 points of FX headwind for the year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Drbul (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then, I guess, my second question is a lot of talk on the World Cup and the product offering, I just wondered if any of you guys would share your predictions for the winner?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Trevor Edwards (Executives)】\nWe just hope that the best teams win.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Ohmes (Analysts)】\nMy question is on North America. I get this question a lot. How -- can you give us a little bit more of a map on how you are going to keep the North America momentum going? Is it more price increases? Is it an acceleration in store growth? Internet? Is it more leaning on Women's growth acceleration? Just maybe a little more color on how you guys expect to keep that going through the next year or 2.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Trevor Edwards (Executives)】\nAbsolutely. It's a question that -- we clearly always get that same question, and the thing that we would continue to say is that we see great momentum in North America today. Our futures growth of 11% continues to demonstrate that we can continue to leverage the category offense to continue to grow the brand and the overall market. One of the key things that we've certainly learned is by drilling down against any of the opportunities in the category, we can continue to grow. So we see great growth coming from the categories that are currently our perennial categories, as I talked about earlier. Whether that's Running, that's Basketball, those obviously are our key categories, which will see growth, and we'll see Sportswear grow. In addition, we see great growth coming from the other categories, such as our Women's business, our Young Athletes business, as well as e-commerce. So those are all very underpenetrated opportunities. So we look at the North America, and we see just tremendous growth potential in the marketplace. Overall, our -- also we have our focus with our key retail partners around continuing to transform the marketplace, so we can increase the capacity in that marketplace, which we are certainly seeing great success from doing that today. So all in all, we still see tremendous ways to grow. E-commerce, Young Athletes, Women's, Apparel, all of those represent really great opportunities for us to grow, in addition to the current and expected businesses where we're doing well today.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Parker (Executives)】\nYes, I'll just quickly add that the -- we have a sizable investment in -- ongoing investment in DTC, and that's not just to create more premium points of distribution. It's actually to help us elevate our business and how we manage our brand in North America, certainly, and then around the world. We're getting better, I think, at retail presentation, consumer experiences, storytelling, merchandising, product flow, assortment planning. These are the things that you have to do just to be a better brand and a better business. And so we're leveraging that investment in DTC to really drive more potential in North America. But then also it's a -- really a blueprint for expanding our business around the world.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Weiner (Analysts)】\nSo I was looking for a little more color on your long-term gross margin drivers. So I think the key drivers that you've talked about in the past are a shift to -- are a geographic shift outside of the North America, a shift from Footwear to Apparel and then also a shift to DTC. It feels like the DTC is what's helping the most right now. Can you just kind of confirm if that's the case? And if it is, maybe provide a little color about when maybe the shift to apparel and the geographic gross margin shift may start to contribute to the overall gross margin gains as well, if they're not already?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Donald Blair (Executives)】\nOkay. Well, let me just start with the biggest drivers. I mean, certainly, we start with the top line. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we have done quite a bit of work around our consumer value equation. And one of the things that the strength of our brand and the innovation that's in our products means that there's a great consumer value proposition at higher price points. So certainly, working to optimize that price-value equation, we think we can continue to raise prices, particularly around product innovation and brand strength. And then the second thing is migrating consumers to premium product. So that is definitely a trend we've seen both on the Footwear and the Apparel side. The second one is really making sure that we are working that product-cost equation. And as Mark indicated earlier, there's a whole range of supply chain and manufacturing initiatives that plays all the way from the evolutionary to the revolutionary. And the objective there is to raise the productivity of labor, to reduce waste of materials, and produce even more premium product and we're driving hard against those. DTC is certainly a positive driver for us, and our DTC business is -- has increased significantly in profitability as we've driven our dot-com business and also as we've gotten better and better, as Mark indicated, at operating retail. So all of those are key drivers. They were key drivers in '14. We expect them to be key drivers again in '15 and going forward.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jay Sole (Analysts)】\nMark, I just had a question about the reset going on in China. Can you just walk us through the strategic decision-making process for thinking about whether to prioritize investment and distribution into NIKE.com versus investment in brick-and-mortar retail, whether it's your own or wholesale partners -- or sorry, retail partners.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Parker (Executives)】\nWell, we're actually investing in both. We're -- as you've heard us talk about quite a bit, we're investing in elevating the presentation of NIKE at retail, looking at how we can improve our ability to create a more profitable, more focused business,  raise the level of execution against the categories. It's really imperative that we not only learn how to do that ourselves in that market, but actually help to leverage those learnings through our retail partners. So the physical retail investments we're making in China are absolutely critical. I'm really excited about what has transpired over this past year and then our ability through '15 and beyond to start to scale those learnings across both our own retail and our wholesale partners. Certainly, we're very bullish on dot-com, dot-com not only in China, but around the world. We think that that's just going to continue to be a bigger and bigger percentage of our business going forward. And China is certainly no exception, very digitally connected country, consumer. And that channel for us -- that medium for commerce is absolutely the future. So we're going to be as bullish out there as we possibly can.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Donald Blair (Executives)】\nYes, and the one thing I'd also underline from an economic standpoint is our focus is on productivity and profitability of retail. So for us, from a return standpoint, this is really driving more revenue, more profitability through a given size of distribution infrastructure, which is not to say we won't expand over time, but the strategy is not adding lots of new stores in lower-tier cities here. We're really focused on making our existing base more profitable, more productive for us and for our retailers.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Trevor Edwards (Executives)】\nAnd one other thing too, as Mark just mentioned, in China specifically, last quarter, we actually went in and upgraded our entire NIKE.com site in our China business. And that, again, is one of those things as we continue to transform that marketplace using all the investments that we put in place, we're now leveraging that in China specifically. So I think you'll see that play out in the future as that continues to grow.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mitch Kummetz (Analysts)】\nTrevor, in your prepared remarks, you referenced the momentum on the Women's side. I was wondering if -- is that more of a U.S. phenomenon? Are you seeing that trending elsewhere? And then in terms of the growth that you're seeing there, is it more on the Apparel side than Footwear? Is it more DTC than wholesale? Just any color on that would be helpful.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Trevor Edwards (Executives)】\nYes, certainly. Yes -- no, we absolutely see just great momentum in the Women's business. Actually, it's not only in North America but actually across all the geographies. We're seeing great growth as we've gone in, and certainly, we're seeing really a strong brand position. All the work that we've done around the Nike Training app has really helped to unlock a connection with our female consumer. We continue to bring really great products and premium products into the marketplace, and so she's very obviously excited about that. And then thirdly, what we're also doing is around distribution. We've been able to go in and work at our DTC doors to use them, as Don says, as a sharp point to better understand that consumer and then roll that strategy out with our wholesale partners. Now in terms of Footwear and Apparel, actually, we're seeing growth in both -- on both dimensions. Certainly, our Footwear on both Running -- from Running to Training, to actually Sportswear and certainly around Apparel, we're seeing great growth in the Women's Training apparel, as well as in Women's Running apparel. So again, just tremendous upside here, and I think going forward, you're going to see us put a lot more focus on this part of the business because we truly believe this is an area where we can be very successful and then we see great opportunity.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Parker (Executives)】\nI'll add too that the Women's business on the dot-com side has been incredibly healthy as well, and we expect that to continue through '15 and beyond. And that's a real focal point for us on the Women's side is that dot-com's business -- dot-com business. And then the futures on our Women's business are actually very, very healthy as well. So we see a lot of momentum going into fiscal year '15.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mitch Kummetz (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then real quickly in Western Europe, I mean, a lot of momentum there. You talked about some of the strategies that you have placed in that market. I'm also wondering, how much of a factor is the -- is an economic recovery there? I mean, is it mostly that you're taking share through some of these strategies or are you also benefiting from somewhat of a tailwind from economic recovery?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Trevor Edwards (Executives)】\nI think from our side, we're certainly seeing just broad-based growth across all of the Western European marketplace. And that, we truly believe, is a function of the reset that we did 2 years ago when we decided to really focus against the category offense, as well as have a more centralized approach to the European marketplace. So we've seen great growth really across all the territories. And even in the Iberia, so the southern parts where it was struggling, we're certainly seeing strength in those zones coming back. So we really truly believe our category offense is what's driving that, and we -- we're seeing the numbers actually go really ahead of any economic recovery. So we feel very strong that it's really about our approach in that market, and we think we've only just gotten started. We think there is just tremendous growth continuing to come through.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kelley Hall (Executives)】\nGreat. Well, thank you, everybody. Appreciate you joining us for our year-end call today, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thanks a lot, Kevin, and good morning to everyone. Thanks for joining our third quarter earnings update. As usual, I'm joined this morning by Hugh Grant, our Chairman and CEO; Brett Begemann, our President and Chief Operating Officer; as well as Pierre Courduroux, our CFO. Also joining me from the IR team are Ashley Wissmann, Tim Boeker and Laura Meyer. \r\nThis call is being webcast, and you can access the webcast, supporting slides and the replay at monsanto.com. We have provided you today with EPS measures on both a GAAP and ongoing business basis. Where we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, we reconcile to GAAP in the slides and in the press release, both of which are on the website. This call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements are based on assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, the company's actual performance and results may vary in a material way from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. A description of the factors that may cause such a variance is included in the Safe Harbor language in our most recent 10-K and in today's press release.\r\nSo this morning, we built our update around the opportunity we see for Monsanto's long-term growth, including some key announcements around our growth targets, our strategy and the next important step in our capital structure. \r\nWhile we'll focus on our longer-term growth horizon, let me anchor the conversation with a couple of key results on Slides 4 and 5. Ongoing earnings for the quarter were $1.62 per share. And with those Q3 results in hand, we have the clarity on the remainder of the year, and we've raised our outlook to the upper end of our original guidance range for ongoing EPS and free cash flow, affirming our full year growth this year. With this quarter, we continue to see our Seeds and Genomics segment as the largest contributor to that full year growth, and we continue to make incremental progress on our overall GP contribution, margin expansion and in our ongoing EBITDA. \r\nSo with that, let me hand it to Hugh to take us through the updates this morning and the next steps in our strategic outlook.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Brian, and good morning to everybody on the line. While we always take a look forward in Q3, today, we take a bolder approach. Most importantly, we're defining our growth strategy over the next 5 years, and we're beginning to truly use our capital structure more aggressively. In the last 1.5 years, we've crossed several key business milestones that give us a new level of clarity and confidence in how we see our global growth over a multiyear runway. \r\nWe've just completed an update of our strategy. The clear conclusion: We see a unique combination of core growth, new platforms and the opportunity to better leverage our capital structure. \r\nThere's a lot of news in our announcement today. Let me walk you through each element, starting on Slide 6, and tie the headlines to my strategic priorities for our company. First, we are unlocking the next evolution in our strategy. We're not simply a seed company. Today, we're providing multiple solutions to farmers by delivering improved yield technology in the seed, in the bag and in the field. That translates to a compelling vision of how this industry can expand yield and productivity through the convergence of biology, technology and information. As farmers become increasingly digitized, information and, specifically, platforms like precision agriculture become the integrator, expanding from our core seed business to create opportunity to optimize yield across the 40-plus key decisions that farmers make every season. \r\nThere's no company better positioned to lead this evolution. That's who we are. And just as we led the seeds revolution, we're driving the industry to expand the view on how we deliver yield and productivity to our grower customers.\r\nThe second point I'd emphasize is in Slide 7. With such a compelling vision, we are back -- we're willing to back our confidence in long-term growth with a new target to at least double our ongoing EPS over the next 5 years. We haven't laid out multiyear targets for the past several years. Doing so today is evidence of the confidence that we have in our core business and the transformational potential in our growth platforms. It's also backed by our focus on our farmer customers and the success that we've had over the past few years as farmers have responded well to our effort to provide more options and value with better performing products. \r\nWe believe we've positioned ourselves to sustain the mid-teens-plus EPS growth that's been our hallmark through a full decade. The ability to target continued growth at that level, off a revenue base in the range of $15 billion, speaks to the depth of the Monsanto portfolio and the magnitude of the opportunity that our strategy unlocks. \r\nThe foundation of our confidence is our core business, and as we've lifted our outlook to the high end of the guidance range today, we see it as an important proof point. Our core business performance is allowing us to deliver our growth commitments in the toughest ag environment in the past several years. Within that, corn certainly has been more challenged by the industry headwinds of declining acres, a tougher commodity environment and direct currency effects, but it's still a source of expected full year growth in our portfolio. \r\nWith some of the macro shifting, soybeans have emerged as a true fiscal year '14 highlight, delivering record growth that foreshadows the opportunity ahead in the decade of the soybean. So despite a year where commodity prices reset, corn acres declined in the world's biggest regions and global currencies became a significant headwind, there's no hesitation. We see Seeds and Traits delivering a majority of the full year growth to back our guidance, and that performance is a key proof point of our portfolio balance that turns into opportunity as we see this core Seeds and Traits engine delivering more than $4 billion in total GP growth as the largest driver in our 5-year target. \r\nThe third key point I'd emphasize is on Slide 8, our plan to return an additional $10 billion to our shareowners over the next 2 years, which is another important expression of our confidence in Monsanto's long-term growth. Today, we've announced a major step forward that allows us to use the strength of our cash generation and balance sheet. We're now targeting a net debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio of 1.5 by the end of fiscal year '15. That level would reflect the seasonality of our business, but importantly, it takes our balance sheet from a negative net debt position to one providing an opportunity to use our capital structure and return significant cash directly to shareowners. \r\nOver the past 1.5 years, we've been working on this plan as we've passed several key business milestones and we move quickly to get to our target level. One of our first capital allocation priorities will be a new 2-year $10 billion share buyback program with an expected accelerated share repurchase of approximately $6 billion in the near term. \r\nAnd that leads to my final point. With everything that we've assembled today, the roadmap for our growth is as clear as ever. Brett will describe this in detail, but our future growth is enabled by 3 key elements. We're a global company that has strong embedded organic growth. We're a company that's building transformational new platforms with compelling growth prospects, and we're a company that now intends to use our powerful cash generation and capital structure to compound growth and create value for our owners. \r\nOne of the most exciting elements of that is we are now at pivot point where our new platforms start to deliver real growth. These are platforms that we expect will form a key part of our earnings profile in the next 5-year period. And this will be one of the focal points of our summer field event as we host our seventh Whistle Stop tour this August. \r\nThe springboard this year has actually exceeded our initial plans as we have more customers and more acres in all of our Climate Corporation platform products and services. That, in turn, provides an early confidence point for the ramp-up over the next few years for what we see as a transformational platform. We'll outline our specific expectations for the fiscal year '15 outlook as we close out this fiscal year, but fundamentally, we certainly see fiscal year '15 as the beginning of the next half decade of growth. At no point have we had as much clarity in both the opportunity ahead, as well as in the roadmap that gets us there. We're a company that sees growth 5 years down the line, and that's compelling. We have the strategy, we have the tools, and we're focused on delivering. \r\nSo with that, let me give the time remaining to Brett to give you the deeper dive into our business platforms.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Hugh, and good morning to everyone on the line. Our confidence in committing to a long-term growth target is a function of both our core business and the new platforms that strengthen our growth opportunity. \r\nOn Slide 9, you'll see that confidence has increased as we've delivered a handful of critical milestones over the past 1.5 years. Those range from the reinvigoration of our soybean platform with the launch of Intacta and our agreement with DuPont to the establishment of new growth platforms in precision ag and biologicals. Those milestones set the roadmap to our growth on Slide 10. We believe we've de-risked some of the biggest factors, crystallizing our line of sight on what drives our opportunity. That obviously has its start in fiscal year '14. It is clear that what we needed to demonstrate this year was that our Seeds and Traits business is returning as the biggest driver of our growth and that's on track. \r\nAs we walk through the elements, let's start with corn. Despite continued softening across the macro environment, we expect corn to be a source of full year growth and part of the Seeds and Traits rebound. That's highlighted by the most strategically important drivers. We're seeing good price mix lift driven by our portfolio upgrades in all regions, and we've seen the COGS improvement we anticipated, highlighted by the U.S. That's even more meaningful in a tougher macro environment. \r\nFor perspective, this year, corn acres have come down in the Americas by about 5%, and currency reflects an incremental headwind to our business of roughly another 3%. Those factors have tempered some of the upside growth this year, along with continued volatility in the Ukraine and some incremental effects in Latin America. There was widespread rain and flooding in Argentina that has significantly reduced our production yields, resulting in much higher costs in the current sales season. Likewise, in Brazil, our largest competitor has acknowledged it had some challenges with insect resistance to its key traits, making some late pricing adjustments across the current market. Those are all realities of the current macro conditions. We work through variations every year. We've made our adjustments, and we feel good that our global corn portfolio allows us to continue to grow, even in a year like this. \r\nOur portfolio clearly positions us well for some of this macro shifting, and you see some of the corresponding positives in soybeans, where we're on track for record growth this year. That includes both the pure pickup in the core business as planted acres favor soybeans, as well as the compounded benefit from drivers that we expect to elevate the earnings power of this platform over the next few years, notably Intacta in Latin America and the overall Roundup Ready 2 Yield platform in the U.S. The rest of the portfolio is effectively where we expect it and complementing the bigger corn and soy engines. In cotton, there's been a little pickup in U.S. acres that offset a bit of the declining acres in Australia. And in vegetables, we're now tracking with the turnaround in revenue and gross profit contribution we anticipated for the full year. \r\nDelivering in this tougher environment pressure tests our strategy and validates the value of our portfolio, and that culminates in how we see our growth setup for the next 5 years. To be clear, we expect the largest driver of our overall opportunity through 2019 is growth in the core Seeds and Traits business. In that time, we expect to deliver more than $4 billion in new total gross profit growth. \r\nThere's no better example of that opportunity in earnings power than the emergence of the soybean platform on Slide 11. It's a platform with the fastest expected rate of growth in the next 5 years. With the progression of Roundup Ready 2 Yield, Intacta and Roundup Ready Xtend, for the first time, the soybean platform mirrors the multi-stack, rapid upgrade opportunity in our corn business. \r\nThe most visible proof point is Intacta on Slide 12. Today, we take the early step in what we see as the fastest historical ramp of any soybean trait. The full supply availability is still coming together as wet weather has delayed harvest in Argentina and we work through the qualification process given the end-season drought in Brazil. So while it's early, we're very comfortable being able to target 10 million to 12 million acres in the upcoming season. That's our biggest second year step-up in soybeans. It's 3x to 4x the reach of this year's launch and twice the level that we saw with the ramp-up of Roundup Ready 2 Yield in its second year. That's a clear validation of Intacta's performance and the opportunity. The majority of this next year's expected step-up will be in Brazil. But we'll also begin commercial launch across Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay, passing another key strategic milestone in this 100 million-acre opportunity.\r\nThat catalytic opportunity in soybeans is backed by the continued growth and expansion we see in our biggest platform, our global corn business. More than half of our Seeds and Traits revenues are driven by corn, reflecting the opportunity across multiple layers and multiple geographies. This is the extension of growth we've proven for the past decade, including portfolio upgrades, our expanded footprint and continued trade opportunity, all of which drive our mix and volume. \r\nThe biggest factor in that opportunity is on Slide 13, our ability to leverage our industry-leading breeding program to upgrade our portfolio every year in every key corn-growing region. There's real power in this significant steady engine across our biggest business. There's also a multiplier effect on Slide 14 as we use that same breeding engine to expand our opportunity as we target new high-growth markets that drive volume. Today, it's playing out in areas like Eastern Europe, one of our fastest-growing corn regions this year despite the political unrest in the Ukraine. That's the kind of opportunity that allows us to be on par this year with our record volume years, even as acres have shrunk in key markets in North and South America. That core growth in Seeds and Traits is complemented by our Ag Productivity segment.  Going forward, we continue to see Ag Productivity as an important strategic support for the Seeds and Traits growth. And while it's likely there will be some variability in any year, we see this more in a support role than as a growth driver itself. \r\nMy final area of emphasis is on what I think will be one of the most significant incremental drivers, and that's our Climate Corporation platform on Slide 15. This year is a pivot point. We have some important proof points this year that increase our confidence in the ramp-up to what we see as a 1 billion acre runway and a $20 billion market opportunity. As farms are increasingly digitized, precision ag can become an integrating point for information, seed, equipment and other inputs. \r\nOne of the most important areas of progress on Slide 16 has been in building out that platform. In the short time since our Climate Corporation acquisition, this partner opportunity has been a highlight, beginning with our early collaboration with WinField. We also have agreements with additional anchor partners, including Agrium's Crop Production Services, GROWMARK, Wilbur Ellis and Helena, as well as our first equipment partner, CNH Industrial. Including Monsanto, this is a base with more than $60 billion in total annual sales, and just as importantly, these are partners that touch virtually every corn and soybean acre in the U.S. in some form. That reach can help us take the next step in building an industry platform that makes precision agriculture a bigger tool for our farmer customers. \r\nThe next validation point is the interest in the suite of products in our Climate Corporation platform. The response has been far stronger than we anticipated. We wanted to see Climate Basic get a foothold as a free service to build exposure and interest. And we believed if we could validate that on 20 million acres, it would be a strong year. As of the end of May, we had more than 40 million installed acres or total acres for all accounts, and more than 30 million of those acres are active users, using the service in the last 30 days. That means nearly 1 in 5 acres of U.S. corn and soybeans are enrolled, giving us an account base that represents an important foundation for expansion and active usage that demonstrates the practical value on the farm. \r\nWe also entered the year planning for a Ground Breakers-like experience on premium services like Climate Pro, targeting hundreds of thousands of acres. The response has been equally good in this area, and we now anticipate the premium offerings will be used on more than 1 million acres across the U.S. Corn Belt this year. \r\nWe know this is just a start, but these milestones are a springboard that we expect to move us from an investment platform this year to a real earnings contributor in the next few years, onto what we truly believe is a multibillion-dollar, long-term opportunity. \r\nLet me bring all these points together. We've passed a number of key milestones in the past 18 months. Those give us greater clarity in our growth outlook for the next 5 years. Those drivers come directly from the success we've had over the past decade, reflecting a strong, growing core and new platforms that draw on our powerful technology head start. And that's both a source of confidence and the point of focus as we target the compelling opportunity in front of us. \r\nSo with that, let me hand it over to Pierre.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Brett, and good morning to everyone. As CFO, my priority is to have a clear view of what drives growth and how it translates into the financials. So let me give you the highlights from today through a financial lens.\r\nNumber one, our growth plan builds on the strong growth we've delivered in our business over the past few years, continuing that momentum. And with our improved outlook today, we're on track to both deliver our bottom line guidance and to affirm Seeds and Traits as the biggest contributor of that full year growth.\r\nNumber two, setting a multiyear target underscores our confidence in our continued opportunity. I take a prudent approach to our guidance outlook. So establishing a long-term metric is a reflection of our confidence in our core business, a compelling strategy and a clear view on the factors that drive growth.\r\nAnd number three, having surpassed several key milestones in our business, we are now well positioned to better optimize our capital structure. Given the strength of our current balance sheet and our confidence in our growth prospects, we have decided to take advantage of the favorable debt market. By the end of FY '15, we intend to target a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.5. And one of the ways we'll immediately put that structure to work is through a new $10 billion share buyback authorization, which includes our intent to use $6 billion in the near term through an accelerated buyback program.\r\nI'll cover how we'll use our capital structure in more detail, but before I do so, let me anchor on the business performance in the current fiscal year on Slide 17. With the visibility from Q3, we now expect to be at the upper end of our original ongoing EPS and free cash flow guidance ranges. With 1 quarter less, we have good clarity in delivering that updated range, reinforcing our growth even in a challenging macro environment and with roughly $0.15 to $0.20 EPS impact from currency headwinds.\r\nQ3 came in somewhat better than we projected during our Q2 call with ongoing EPS of $1.62. That relative performance came across the P&L and includes some timing benefits from the core business, operating expenses and taxes. If you look at the quarter on a year-over-year basis, as expected, the most direct factor in the comparison was the significant tax benefit that increased Q3 in 2013 and did not repeat this year. As we expected, the corn quarterly gross profit contribution was down versus last year, primarily as a function of the reduced acre base both for the U.S. season, as well as in Latin America, where Safrinha sales also carry into our third quarter.\r\nBut overall, Seeds and Traits GP was up in the quarter as continued strong contribution in our soybean business largely offset the timing and acre effects in corn. The year-to-date performance keeps us on track to achieve strong gross profit growth across Seeds and Traits for the full year, marking the biggest overall contributor to our fiscal '14 outlook. \r\nThrough Q3, we've also seen incremental margin improvements in Seeds and Genomics, and within the soybean and corn segments. And that extrapolates to our full year outlook, where we continue to project margin improvement across all 3 areas. In soybeans, we'll expect another increment of contribution coming from Q4 Intacta sales in Latin America and the second installment of the DuPont royalty, reinforcing our full year expectation for a margin increase of 6 to 8 points. In corn, we've seen very good margin growth in our U.S. business as we've seen the COGS benefits flow through together with the expected gains from our mix uplift. Those benefits have been offset some in Latin America, including the COGS effect in Argentina and the corn pricing dynamics in Brazil that Brett described. For the full year, we expect overall corn margin to still step up, but with those Latin American effects, it will likely come in somewhat lower than our original 3-point target. \r\nWith our updated guidance, we still project a stronger fourth quarter. But given the timing benefit we see in Q3, we now expect to deliver a loss rather than breakeven EPS in Q4. Aside from some of that Q3 effect, we still see the same drivers that reduce the overall year-over-year loss, including the next increments of soybean growth and uptick in corn as we anticipate less adjustments in U.S. returns and a more typical contribution from our vegetable business. And as a result, we expect to see the last incremental contribution that allows us to get to a full year ongoing EBITDA target of mid- to high-teens growth.\r\nIf we move to the longer view, our fiscal year '14 performance becomes the foundation for how we see our strategy unfolding over the next 5 years, on Slide 18. Working from the fiscal year '14 base, we are targeting at least doubling our ongoing EPS by 2019, and I'm comfortable that there are multiple sources backing that target, reflecting a good line of sight on the core business, on the new platforms and on the benefit of our capital structure. And the reality is that all those factors should contribute. \r\nLikewise, we've built our plan on baseline assumptions, so each factor holds the potential to be a bigger relative contributor, depending on the different growth trajectories. We have also left ourselves room to invest for growth, including CapEx to expand our base business, as well as for M&A. The single biggest contributor is pure gross profit expansion, reflecting the embedded opportunity in the core business. Logically, the biggest source of that growth comes from corn and soybean. But this is also complemented by the expansion of the broader portfolio, ranging from crops like vegetables, canola and cotton, to continued technology development and licensing agreements.\r\nWe see this opportunity translating to more than $4 billion in total incremental GP, which would mark our largest incremental Seeds and Traits GP growth in any 5-year period in our history. We also anticipate that the precision agriculture platform will become a meaningful contributor to earnings throughout this 5-year period. The contribution in the early years is expected to be relatively small, but as that business ramps up, we expect an accelerated contribution. \r\nAs we look to build the new platforms, we plan to align our investments and support them appropriately, putting more resources behind these high-growth areas and streamlining or redeploying some operating expenses from lower-growth business areas.\r\nThe performance and operating expense discipline in our core business allows us to make some near-term investments in our new platforms to jump-start those opportunities. In FY '14, we have invested a little more than $200 million of combined operating expense in precision ag and biologicals. We are planning to ramp that to an expected level of more than $300 million -- $350 million in FY '15 as we make investment in the people and infrastructure that reflects our confidence in the earnings potential of these platforms. That is a conscious investment. And while we will step up our spending in FY '15, I continue to expect to generate overall leverage from GP to earnings once we pass this initial uptake.\r\nOne of the most important elements of our conversation today is our approach to capital allocation on Slide 19. Our decision to return an additional $10 billion to shareowners is a result of a careful consideration by our teams and the board over the last 18 months as we've achieved several business milestones that provide clarity on our planning and capital allocation. \r\nWe are targeting a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.5 by the end of fiscal year '15. That's obviously subject to the seasonality of our business, but fundamentally, we are comfortable with this leverage level. And as part of our ongoing strategic planning, we will continue to review and recalibrate our capital allocation as appropriate, with the goal of remaining both opportunistic and disciplined. \r\nAt the level of 1.5 turns of debt, we expect to be able to better optimize our cost of capital while balancing a few key priorities on Slide 20. Our first priority is to continue to invest in high-growth opportunities that support our strategy and drive growth. We have the financial flexibility to pursue both organic and external growth, including investments in our business, in technology deals and M&A. We'll be disciplined in our use of capital in this regard, focusing on opportunities that meet our growth and return criteria. At the same time, we are committed to returning capital to our owners, and this capital structure affords us the flexibility to deliver further value to our owners with an accelerated buyback program and through dividends. \r\nAnother important priority is to maintain our strong investment-grade credit ratings to provide access to attractive financing for our long-term needs, as well as in-season borrowings for our working capital needs. \r\nOne of the first priorities of our capital allocation will be on share buybacks. Our board just approved a new 2-year $10 billion buyback program. We'll use it in combination with approximately $1 billion that remains in our current program. And as an important first step, we intend to use a combination of cash and new debt to target $6 billion for an accelerated share buyback, which we anticipate beginning in the near term and completing in about 6 to 12 months. We'll likewise continue our focus on the dividend as I view that as a priority element of our strategy as a source of direct income to our long-term owners.\r\nWith that, let me bring this all together. Monsanto is at a unique point in our history. We have the confidence and visibility into our business to talk about delivering growth that effectively spans a decade. That visibility, in turn, allows us to take the next step in our capital allocation. And from there, I believe we can use a unique combination of organic growth, new opportunities and our business structure to meaningfully grow our earnings, our cash generation and ultimately, our return to our shareowners. \r\nThanks, and I'll hand it back to Bryan for the Q&A.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Pierre. With that, we'll now open the line for questions. [Operator Instructions] So Kevin, I think we're ready to open the line for questions at this point.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Bryan Hurley (Executives)】\nThanks a lot, Kevin, and good morning to everyone. Thanks for joining our third quarter earnings update. As usual, I'm joined this morning by Hugh Grant, our Chairman and CEO; Brett Begemann, our President and Chief Operating Officer; as well as Pierre Courduroux, our CFO. Also joining me from the IR team are Ashley Wissmann, Tim Boeker and Laura Meyer. \r\nThis call is being webcast, and you can access the webcast, supporting slides and the replay at monsanto.com. We have provided you today with EPS measures on both a GAAP and ongoing business basis. Where we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, we reconcile to GAAP in the slides and in the press release, both of which are on the website. This call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements are based on assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, the company's actual performance and results may vary in a material way from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. A description of the factors that may cause such a variance is included in the Safe Harbor language in our most recent 10-K and in today's press release.\r\nSo this morning, we built our update around the opportunity we see for Monsanto's long-term growth, including some key announcements around our growth targets, our strategy and the next important step in our capital structure. \r\nWhile we'll focus on our longer-term growth horizon, let me anchor the conversation with a couple of key results on Slides 4 and 5. Ongoing earnings for the quarter were $1.62 per share. And with those Q3 results in hand, we have the clarity on the remainder of the year, and we've raised our outlook to the upper end of our original guidance range for ongoing EPS and free cash flow, affirming our full year growth this year. With this quarter, we continue to see our Seeds and Genomics segment as the largest contributor to that full year growth, and we continue to make incremental progress on our overall GP contribution, margin expansion and in our ongoing EBITDA. \r\nSo with that, let me hand it to Hugh to take us through the updates this morning and the next steps in our strategic outlook.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Hugh Grant (Executives)】\nThank you, Brian, and good morning to everybody on the line. While we always take a look forward in Q3, today, we take a bolder approach. Most importantly, we're defining our growth strategy over the next 5 years, and we're beginning to truly use our capital structure more aggressively. In the last 1.5 years, we've crossed several key business milestones that give us a new level of clarity and confidence in how we see our global growth over a multiyear runway. \r\nWe've just completed an update of our strategy. The clear conclusion: We see a unique combination of core growth, new platforms and the opportunity to better leverage our capital structure. \r\nThere's a lot of news in our announcement today. Let me walk you through each element, starting on Slide 6, and tie the headlines to my strategic priorities for our company. First, we are unlocking the next evolution in our strategy. We're not simply a seed company. Today, we're providing multiple solutions to farmers by delivering improved yield technology in the seed, in the bag and in the field. That translates to a compelling vision of how this industry can expand yield and productivity through the convergence of biology, technology and information. As farmers become increasingly digitized, information and, specifically, platforms like precision agriculture become the integrator, expanding from our core seed business to create opportunity to optimize yield across the 40-plus key decisions that farmers make every season. \r\nThere's no company better positioned to lead this evolution. That's who we are. And just as we led the seeds revolution, we're driving the industry to expand the view on how we deliver yield and productivity to our grower customers.\r\nThe second point I'd emphasize is in Slide 7. With such a compelling vision, we are back -- we're willing to back our confidence in long-term growth with a new target to at least double our ongoing EPS over the next 5 years. We haven't laid out multiyear targets for the past several years. Doing so today is evidence of the confidence that we have in our core business and the transformational potential in our growth platforms. It's also backed by our focus on our farmer customers and the success that we've had over the past few years as farmers have responded well to our effort to provide more options and value with better performing products. \r\nWe believe we've positioned ourselves to sustain the mid-teens-plus EPS growth that's been our hallmark through a full decade. The ability to target continued growth at that level, off a revenue base in the range of $15 billion, speaks to the depth of the Monsanto portfolio and the magnitude of the opportunity that our strategy unlocks. \r\nThe foundation of our confidence is our core business, and as we've lifted our outlook to the high end of the guidance range today, we see it as an important proof point. Our core business performance is allowing us to deliver our growth commitments in the toughest ag environment in the past several years. Within that, corn certainly has been more challenged by the industry headwinds of declining acres, a tougher commodity environment and direct currency effects, but it's still a source of expected full year growth in our portfolio. \r\nWith some of the macro shifting, soybeans have emerged as a true fiscal year '14 highlight, delivering record growth that foreshadows the opportunity ahead in the decade of the soybean. So despite a year where commodity prices reset, corn acres declined in the world's biggest regions and global currencies became a significant headwind, there's no hesitation. We see Seeds and Traits delivering a majority of the full year growth to back our guidance, and that performance is a key proof point of our portfolio balance that turns into opportunity as we see this core Seeds and Traits engine delivering more than $4 billion in total GP growth as the largest driver in our 5-year target. \r\nThe third key point I'd emphasize is on Slide 8, our plan to return an additional $10 billion to our shareowners over the next 2 years, which is another important expression of our confidence in Monsanto's long-term growth. Today, we've announced a major step forward that allows us to use the strength of our cash generation and balance sheet. We're now targeting a net debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio of 1.5 by the end of fiscal year '15. That level would reflect the seasonality of our business, but importantly, it takes our balance sheet from a negative net debt position to one providing an opportunity to use our capital structure and return significant cash directly to shareowners. \r\nOver the past 1.5 years, we've been working on this plan as we've passed several key business milestones and we move quickly to get to our target level. One of our first capital allocation priorities will be a new 2-year $10 billion share buyback program with an expected accelerated share repurchase of approximately $6 billion in the near term. \r\nAnd that leads to my final point. With everything that we've assembled today, the roadmap for our growth is as clear as ever. Brett will describe this in detail, but our future growth is enabled by 3 key elements. We're a global company that has strong embedded organic growth. We're a company that's building transformational new platforms with compelling growth prospects, and we're a company that now intends to use our powerful cash generation and capital structure to compound growth and create value for our owners. \r\nOne of the most exciting elements of that is we are now at pivot point where our new platforms start to deliver real growth. These are platforms that we expect will form a key part of our earnings profile in the next 5-year period. And this will be one of the focal points of our summer field event as we host our seventh Whistle Stop tour this August. \r\nThe springboard this year has actually exceeded our initial plans as we have more customers and more acres in all of our Climate Corporation platform products and services. That, in turn, provides an early confidence point for the ramp-up over the next few years for what we see as a transformational platform. We'll outline our specific expectations for the fiscal year '15 outlook as we close out this fiscal year, but fundamentally, we certainly see fiscal year '15 as the beginning of the next half decade of growth. At no point have we had as much clarity in both the opportunity ahead, as well as in the roadmap that gets us there. We're a company that sees growth 5 years down the line, and that's compelling. We have the strategy, we have the tools, and we're focused on delivering. \r\nSo with that, let me give the time remaining to Brett to give you the deeper dive into our business platforms.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Brett Begemann (Executives)】\nThanks, Hugh, and good morning to everyone on the line. Our confidence in committing to a long-term growth target is a function of both our core business and the new platforms that strengthen our growth opportunity. \r\nOn Slide 9, you'll see that confidence has increased as we've delivered a handful of critical milestones over the past 1.5 years. Those range from the reinvigoration of our soybean platform with the launch of Intacta and our agreement with DuPont to the establishment of new growth platforms in precision ag and biologicals. Those milestones set the roadmap to our growth on Slide 10. We believe we've de-risked some of the biggest factors, crystallizing our line of sight on what drives our opportunity. That obviously has its start in fiscal year '14. It is clear that what we needed to demonstrate this year was that our Seeds and Traits business is returning as the biggest driver of our growth and that's on track. \r\nAs we walk through the elements, let's start with corn. Despite continued softening across the macro environment, we expect corn to be a source of full year growth and part of the Seeds and Traits rebound. That's highlighted by the most strategically important drivers. We're seeing good price mix lift driven by our portfolio upgrades in all regions, and we've seen the COGS improvement we anticipated, highlighted by the U.S. That's even more meaningful in a tougher macro environment. \r\nFor perspective, this year, corn acres have come down in the Americas by about 5%, and currency reflects an incremental headwind to our business of roughly another 3%. Those factors have tempered some of the upside growth this year, along with continued volatility in the Ukraine and some incremental effects in Latin America. There was widespread rain and flooding in Argentina that has significantly reduced our production yields, resulting in much higher costs in the current sales season. Likewise, in Brazil, our largest competitor has acknowledged it had some challenges with insect resistance to its key traits, making some late pricing adjustments across the current market. Those are all realities of the current macro conditions. We work through variations every year. We've made our adjustments, and we feel good that our global corn portfolio allows us to continue to grow, even in a year like this. \r\nOur portfolio clearly positions us well for some of this macro shifting, and you see some of the corresponding positives in soybeans, where we're on track for record growth this year. That includes both the pure pickup in the core business as planted acres favor soybeans, as well as the compounded benefit from drivers that we expect to elevate the earnings power of this platform over the next few years, notably Intacta in Latin America and the overall Roundup Ready 2 Yield platform in the U.S. The rest of the portfolio is effectively where we expect it and complementing the bigger corn and soy engines. In cotton, there's been a little pickup in U.S. acres that offset a bit of the declining acres in Australia. And in vegetables, we're now tracking with the turnaround in revenue and gross profit contribution we anticipated for the full year. \r\nDelivering in this tougher environment pressure tests our strategy and validates the value of our portfolio, and that culminates in how we see our growth setup for the next 5 years. To be clear, we expect the largest driver of our overall opportunity through 2019 is growth in the core Seeds and Traits business. In that time, we expect to deliver more than $4 billion in new total gross profit growth. \r\nThere's no better example of that opportunity in earnings power than the emergence of the soybean platform on Slide 11. It's a platform with the fastest expected rate of growth in the next 5 years. With the progression of Roundup Ready 2 Yield, Intacta and Roundup Ready Xtend, for the first time, the soybean platform mirrors the multi-stack, rapid upgrade opportunity in our corn business. \r\nThe most visible proof point is Intacta on Slide 12. Today, we take the early step in what we see as the fastest historical ramp of any soybean trait. The full supply availability is still coming together as wet weather has delayed harvest in Argentina and we work through the qualification process given the end-season drought in Brazil. So while it's early, we're very comfortable being able to target 10 million to 12 million acres in the upcoming season. That's our biggest second year step-up in soybeans. It's 3x to 4x the reach of this year's launch and twice the level that we saw with the ramp-up of Roundup Ready 2 Yield in its second year. That's a clear validation of Intacta's performance and the opportunity. The majority of this next year's expected step-up will be in Brazil. But we'll also begin commercial launch across Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay, passing another key strategic milestone in this 100 million-acre opportunity.\r\nThat catalytic opportunity in soybeans is backed by the continued growth and expansion we see in our biggest platform, our global corn business. More than half of our Seeds and Traits revenues are driven by corn, reflecting the opportunity across multiple layers and multiple geographies. This is the extension of growth we've proven for the past decade, including portfolio upgrades, our expanded footprint and continued trade opportunity, all of which drive our mix and volume. \r\nThe biggest factor in that opportunity is on Slide 13, our ability to leverage our industry-leading breeding program to upgrade our portfolio every year in every key corn-growing region. There's real power in this significant steady engine across our biggest business. There's also a multiplier effect on Slide 14 as we use that same breeding engine to expand our opportunity as we target new high-growth markets that drive volume. Today, it's playing out in areas like Eastern Europe, one of our fastest-growing corn regions this year despite the political unrest in the Ukraine. That's the kind of opportunity that allows us to be on par this year with our record volume years, even as acres have shrunk in key markets in North and South America. That core growth in Seeds and Traits is complemented by our Ag Productivity segment.  Going forward, we continue to see Ag Productivity as an important strategic support for the Seeds and Traits growth. And while it's likely there will be some variability in any year, we see this more in a support role than as a growth driver itself. \r\nMy final area of emphasis is on what I think will be one of the most significant incremental drivers, and that's our Climate Corporation platform on Slide 15. This year is a pivot point. We have some important proof points this year that increase our confidence in the ramp-up to what we see as a 1 billion acre runway and a $20 billion market opportunity. As farms are increasingly digitized, precision ag can become an integrating point for information, seed, equipment and other inputs. \r\nOne of the most important areas of progress on Slide 16 has been in building out that platform. In the short time since our Climate Corporation acquisition, this partner opportunity has been a highlight, beginning with our early collaboration with WinField. We also have agreements with additional anchor partners, including Agrium's Crop Production Services, GROWMARK, Wilbur Ellis and Helena, as well as our first equipment partner, CNH Industrial. Including Monsanto, this is a base with more than $60 billion in total annual sales, and just as importantly, these are partners that touch virtually every corn and soybean acre in the U.S. in some form. That reach can help us take the next step in building an industry platform that makes precision agriculture a bigger tool for our farmer customers. \r\nThe next validation point is the interest in the suite of products in our Climate Corporation platform. The response has been far stronger than we anticipated. We wanted to see Climate Basic get a foothold as a free service to build exposure and interest. And we believed if we could validate that on 20 million acres, it would be a strong year. As of the end of May, we had more than 40 million installed acres or total acres for all accounts, and more than 30 million of those acres are active users, using the service in the last 30 days. That means nearly 1 in 5 acres of U.S. corn and soybeans are enrolled, giving us an account base that represents an important foundation for expansion and active usage that demonstrates the practical value on the farm. \r\nWe also entered the year planning for a Ground Breakers-like experience on premium services like Climate Pro, targeting hundreds of thousands of acres. The response has been equally good in this area, and we now anticipate the premium offerings will be used on more than 1 million acres across the U.S. Corn Belt this year. \r\nWe know this is just a start, but these milestones are a springboard that we expect to move us from an investment platform this year to a real earnings contributor in the next few years, onto what we truly believe is a multibillion-dollar, long-term opportunity. \r\nLet me bring all these points together. We've passed a number of key milestones in the past 18 months. Those give us greater clarity in our growth outlook for the next 5 years. Those drivers come directly from the success we've had over the past decade, reflecting a strong, growing core and new platforms that draw on our powerful technology head start. And that's both a source of confidence and the point of focus as we target the compelling opportunity in front of us. \r\nSo with that, let me hand it over to Pierre.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Pierre Courduroux (Executives)】\nThanks, Brett, and good morning to everyone. As CFO, my priority is to have a clear view of what drives growth and how it translates into the financials. So let me give you the highlights from today through a financial lens.\r\nNumber one, our growth plan builds on the strong growth we've delivered in our business over the past few years, continuing that momentum. And with our improved outlook today, we're on track to both deliver our bottom line guidance and to affirm Seeds and Traits as the biggest contributor of that full year growth.\r\nNumber two, setting a multiyear target underscores our confidence in our continued opportunity. I take a prudent approach to our guidance outlook. So establishing a long-term metric is a reflection of our confidence in our core business, a compelling strategy and a clear view on the factors that drive growth.\r\nAnd number three, having surpassed several key milestones in our business, we are now well positioned to better optimize our capital structure. Given the strength of our current balance sheet and our confidence in our growth prospects, we have decided to take advantage of the favorable debt market. By the end of FY '15, we intend to target a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.5. And one of the ways we'll immediately put that structure to work is through a new $10 billion share buyback authorization, which includes our intent to use $6 billion in the near term through an accelerated buyback program.\r\nI'll cover how we'll use our capital structure in more detail, but before I do so, let me anchor on the business performance in the current fiscal year on Slide 17. With the visibility from Q3, we now expect to be at the upper end of our original ongoing EPS and free cash flow guidance ranges. With 1 quarter less, we have good clarity in delivering that updated range, reinforcing our growth even in a challenging macro environment and with roughly $0.15 to $0.20 EPS impact from currency headwinds.\r\nQ3 came in somewhat better than we projected during our Q2 call with ongoing EPS of $1.62. That relative performance came across the P&L and includes some timing benefits from the core business, operating expenses and taxes. If you look at the quarter on a year-over-year basis, as expected, the most direct factor in the comparison was the significant tax benefit that increased Q3 in 2013 and did not repeat this year. As we expected, the corn quarterly gross profit contribution was down versus last year, primarily as a function of the reduced acre base both for the U.S. season, as well as in Latin America, where Safrinha sales also carry into our third quarter.\r\nBut overall, Seeds and Traits GP was up in the quarter as continued strong contribution in our soybean business largely offset the timing and acre effects in corn. The year-to-date performance keeps us on track to achieve strong gross profit growth across Seeds and Traits for the full year, marking the biggest overall contributor to our fiscal '14 outlook. \r\nThrough Q3, we've also seen incremental margin improvements in Seeds and Genomics, and within the soybean and corn segments. And that extrapolates to our full year outlook, where we continue to project margin improvement across all 3 areas. In soybeans, we'll expect another increment of contribution coming from Q4 Intacta sales in Latin America and the second installment of the DuPont royalty, reinforcing our full year expectation for a margin increase of 6 to 8 points. In corn, we've seen very good margin growth in our U.S. business as we've seen the COGS benefits flow through together with the expected gains from our mix uplift. Those benefits have been offset some in Latin America, including the COGS effect in Argentina and the corn pricing dynamics in Brazil that Brett described. For the full year, we expect overall corn margin to still step up, but with those Latin American effects, it will likely come in somewhat lower than our original 3-point target. \r\nWith our updated guidance, we still project a stronger fourth quarter. But given the timing benefit we see in Q3, we now expect to deliver a loss rather than breakeven EPS in Q4. Aside from some of that Q3 effect, we still see the same drivers that reduce the overall year-over-year loss, including the next increments of soybean growth and uptick in corn as we anticipate less adjustments in U.S. returns and a more typical contribution from our vegetable business. And as a result, we expect to see the last incremental contribution that allows us to get to a full year ongoing EBITDA target of mid- to high-teens growth.\r\nIf we move to the longer view, our fiscal year '14 performance becomes the foundation for how we see our strategy unfolding over the next 5 years, on Slide 18. Working from the fiscal year '14 base, we are targeting at least doubling our ongoing EPS by 2019, and I'm comfortable that there are multiple sources backing that target, reflecting a good line of sight on the core business, on the new platforms and on the benefit of our capital structure. And the reality is that all those factors should contribute. \r\nLikewise, we've built our plan on baseline assumptions, so each factor holds the potential to be a bigger relative contributor, depending on the different growth trajectories. We have also left ourselves room to invest for growth, including CapEx to expand our base business, as well as for M&A. The single biggest contributor is pure gross profit expansion, reflecting the embedded opportunity in the core business. Logically, the biggest source of that growth comes from corn and soybean. But this is also complemented by the expansion of the broader portfolio, ranging from crops like vegetables, canola and cotton, to continued technology development and licensing agreements.\r\nWe see this opportunity translating to more than $4 billion in total incremental GP, which would mark our largest incremental Seeds and Traits GP growth in any 5-year period in our history. We also anticipate that the precision agriculture platform will become a meaningful contributor to earnings throughout this 5-year period. The contribution in the early years is expected to be relatively small, but as that business ramps up, we expect an accelerated contribution. \r\nAs we look to build the new platforms, we plan to align our investments and support them appropriately, putting more resources behind these high-growth areas and streamlining or redeploying some operating expenses from lower-growth business areas.\r\nThe performance and operating expense discipline in our core business allows us to make some near-term investments in our new platforms to jump-start those opportunities. In FY '14, we have invested a little more than $200 million of combined operating expense in precision ag and biologicals. We are planning to ramp that to an expected level of more than $300 million -- $350 million in FY '15 as we make investment in the people and infrastructure that reflects our confidence in the earnings potential of these platforms. That is a conscious investment. And while we will step up our spending in FY '15, I continue to expect to generate overall leverage from GP to earnings once we pass this initial uptake.\r\nOne of the most important elements of our conversation today is our approach to capital allocation on Slide 19. Our decision to return an additional $10 billion to shareowners is a result of a careful consideration by our teams and the board over the last 18 months as we've achieved several business milestones that provide clarity on our planning and capital allocation. \r\nWe are targeting a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.5 by the end of fiscal year '15. That's obviously subject to the seasonality of our business, but fundamentally, we are comfortable with this leverage level. And as part of our ongoing strategic planning, we will continue to review and recalibrate our capital allocation as appropriate, with the goal of remaining both opportunistic and disciplined. \r\nAt the level of 1.5 turns of debt, we expect to be able to better optimize our cost of capital while balancing a few key priorities on Slide 20. Our first priority is to continue to invest in high-growth opportunities that support our strategy and drive growth. We have the financial flexibility to pursue both organic and external growth, including investments in our business, in technology deals and M&A. We'll be disciplined in our use of capital in this regard, focusing on opportunities that meet our growth and return criteria. At the same time, we are committed to returning capital to our owners, and this capital structure affords us the flexibility to deliver further value to our owners with an accelerated buyback program and through dividends. \r\nAnother important priority is to maintain our strong investment-grade credit ratings to provide access to attractive financing for our long-term needs, as well as in-season borrowings for our working capital needs. \r\nOne of the first priorities of our capital allocation will be on share buybacks. Our board just approved a new 2-year $10 billion buyback program. We'll use it in combination with approximately $1 billion that remains in our current program. And as an important first step, we intend to use a combination of cash and new debt to target $6 billion for an accelerated share buyback, which we anticipate beginning in the near term and completing in about 6 to 12 months. We'll likewise continue our focus on the dividend as I view that as a priority element of our strategy as a source of direct income to our long-term owners.\r\nWith that, let me bring this all together. Monsanto is at a unique point in our history. We have the confidence and visibility into our business to talk about delivering growth that effectively spans a decade. That visibility, in turn, allows us to take the next step in our capital allocation. And from there, I believe we can use a unique combination of organic growth, new opportunities and our business structure to meaningfully grow our earnings, our cash generation and ultimately, our return to our shareowners. \r\nThanks, and I'll hand it back to Bryan for the Q&A.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Bryan Hurley (Executives)】\nThanks, Pierre. With that, we'll now open the line for questions. [Operator Instructions] So Kevin, I think we're ready to open the line for questions at this point.",
      "transcript_text3": "A question on the corn business. I just want to understand both sort of how to connect what's taken place this year, with sort of what's underlying the target out to '19. And I guess, in particular, this year, is there any issue in terms of returns that you are reserved for in the third quarter because of what's gone on with planted acreage in the North or the recent flooding that you just don't know what the numbers are and we might learn more about that in '14? And then as it relates to going forward, as you went through the presentation and we saw some familiar stuff on some of the slides, some of the things that I noticed you didn't mention that I want to understand what your view is going forward, was you've historically talked about the 5% to 10% price mix lift, and you'd also had a target of sort of a $1 billion in sales coming from that. Are those numbers still good, or are we thinking about things differently now?\n\n---\n\nThanks for the question. I think all 3 of us will take a piece of this. Let me start by saying we are -- I think corn had a good year, not a great year. Beans picked up a lot of that slack, but if you look across the Americas, we saw acreage contract, and I think a big piece of our numbers reflects that contraction. And I would say, even with that contraction, we see volume about flat year-on-year. So if you step back, I feel pretty good about the corn performance given the challenges, but maybe ask Brett to say a little bit about the market and then, Pierre, maybe a few words on returns and how you see that playing out in that piece, and mix as well?\n\n---\n\nYes, thanks, Vince. I think there's a couple of really key points to think about. And it is both this year and as we start to progress into next year. First of all, as we mentioned, we've seen hundreds of millions of dollars lost to less acres and currency this year in our corn business. But as we look at the core of our corn business, that was offset by our mix gains in the various regions and the significant COGS improvement that we expected to get in the U.S. And in the U.S., we remain on target for those. And as Hugh mentioned, along with that, our soybean business is having an absolutely record year, driven by, of course, the new products in soybeans and the build-out of Roundup Ready 2 Yield, but also the portfolio advantage we have as those corn acres shifted to bean acres and we picked up on that. And then also, looking at next year, in the corn business, as you mentioned, we're going to be challenged on COGS in South America with the production issues that we faced in Argentina with the floods that we had late in the year. But I think as I step back and look at it, I feel good about the fundamentals of our corn business and the strength that we have in the fundamental corn business. And that is literally what gives us the confidence to speak to a 5-year plan, where the vast majority of that growth is going to come from our core Seeds and Traits business.\n\n---\n\nSo, Pierre, maybe a few words on returns?\n\n---\n\nYes, maybe to address the specifics of your question, Vincent, regarding returns. As we mentioned during the previous call, last year we got surprised in the fourth quarter with higher returns. I mean, we and the farmers actually got surprised with higher returns related to basically the fact that the market was anticipating 97 million acres planting, and it ended up being on more like 95 million acres. This year, we've been very prudent, I think, and we shouldn't be facing such an issue. And this was one of the reasons, actually, we were anticipating Q3 to be lower than last year in corn. So I mean there's no surprise to that. That's the message we tried to send during the Q2 earnings call and that's what we see today. So we feel very comfortable that during our Q4, we shouldn't see any significant adjustments to our returns.\n\n---\n\nCould you speak to the 5% to 10% price mix uplift and that sort of $1 billion target, are those still good?\n\n---\n\nSo as far as the 5% to 10% price mix uplift, what we see this year is, I mean from a margins perspective, we feel really good about the situation in the U.S., where we've seen both the cost of goods upgrades we were anticipating and also the price mix uplift. I mean, it was a more difficult year than we've seen in the past but we've seen very nice price uplift. So we still think this is a key driver of our growth going forward.\n\n---\n\nAs you execute on the $10 billion recapitalization, can you speak to what implications, if any, the new program will have for alternative uses of capital? I'm thinking about trajectory on capital expenditures, SG&A expense and what are your latest thoughts on M&A?\n\n---\n\nI'll maybe ask Pierre to say a few words. Our M&A -- well, let me take a step back and kind of kick this up a piece, Kevin. We see, as Brett made the point in the last question, on our 5-year growth targets, we see the lion's share of that growth coming out of our core. So any growth that we see from Climate Corp. and some of the new platforms, lays on top of that. And then the capital allocation piece leverages that growth. So that's how we're thinking about it. We'll continue on CapEx. We'll continue to invest on building up our plants to drive capacity as we see share gains. I think as you look at The Climate Corp. deal, we see that as a central integrator, and that brings together our seed chemistry opportunities, fertilizer, machinery, and our retail partners. It integrates them around that hub. But within that play, I would assume there's probably still going to be M&A opportunities. And we are looking at keeping powder dry to do that. So I just -- I think with the 5-year view, the key in this is, it's our core business that drives that -- drives the lion's share of that growth.\n\n---\n\nAnd maybe as a complement to what Hugh just said, I mean you are still looking at a business with strong cash generation, strong free cash generation. So when we made the decision that -- when our board made the decision to vote on this buyback program, we had assessed our potential for growth and the potential for cash generation. So we feel actually very good that we're going to be able to fund our business and the growth that we have in our plan going forward.\n\n---\n\nAs a follow-up, if I may, on the precision ag component of your plan, I think you described it as meaningful. You're over-delivering in the near term on the acreage. Can you talk about what that acreage ramp could look like into fiscal '15 and beyond, and also update us on kind of the economics of your partnership arrangement and how that flows through to Monsanto on a gross and net basis?\n\n---\n\nYes, it's still early for how we're seeing that flow through, Kevin. I would say, we are delighted in the performance this year. So when we lead out a goal and hit the 20 million -- if you draw that against any conventional ramp that we've seen in the last 15 years in our Seeds and Traits business, it surpasses any of that. So growth from 20 million to 40 million acres in the first year, and then see 30 million of that 40 million as real users or users that are using that on a regular basis, it gives us cause for optimism that we're delivering value and that we're growing the consumer experience. But Brett, maybe a few words on how these partners are linking in?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think, Kevin, as we look at this, it's clearly continuing to build out the platform in the early years, and the contribution will be in the later years of the 5-year plan. I'd say, as Hugh mention, I think this platform is demonstrating that it can be the integrator of bringing together decisions around how the farmer manages his land, his seed choices, his crop protection choices, his fertility programs, his equipment, et cetera, and our goal will be to continue to build out that platform with our partners. And I'm thrilled at this point to have basically all of our large retail partners on board with us. We're in conversations with lots of other potential partners to bring that together. So I continue to look at this as very, very excited, given the success we've had in the early years and the real expression of interest from the farmer level with these early acres, that's huge. The farmers are telling us that they're really interested in it, and the key is their behavior followed what they've been telling us that they were interested in. But the build-out from a financial standpoint will be later in that 5 year plan, Kevin.\n\n---\n\nCould you give us the Roundup or the glyphosate price volume trends in the quarter? And do you become capacity constrained in glyphosate any time in this 5 year plan that you've got?\n\n---\n\nJohn, I think -- I used to say we're half the business and the Chinese are the other half. We are the smaller half of it now. So we -- I like the strategy. We make what we sell. So we make a bunch of Roundup and we sell everything that we make every year, and that's a pretty good model for a business. And we price, we lay our price in pretty right on top of the generic glyphosate so there's nothing fancy in this. But it works, it's simple and it's served us well this year. Trends in the core -- or Brett, maybe our work done this year versus next year may be helpful.\n\n---\n\nYes, I don't think that we saw the trends change all that much this year. We started this year saying we would be flat to up through the year and as I look to the future, I expect Roundup to be flat to down going forwards versus the uptrend and we see that playing out in the marketplace going through next year. So I don't see significant movement on that going forwards to next year, but the trend would be flat to down. But again, it's in a supporting role of our core Seeds and Traits business and as Hugh said, we sell out of Roundup every year and we're going to focus on our core Seeds and Traits.\n\n---\n\nYou wouldn't expect any significant capital then to go to that business, I would suspect, over this 5-year plan?\n\n---\n\nNo, we would not. And that's a great segue, John. Today, we announced a 5-year goal of doubling EPS, we see significant growth in the business. Roundup is a great product, it's a great cash generator. But from where in 2019 looking back, it's going to be our Seeds and Traits business that really drives that growth as the integration of The Climate Corp. platform and how we integrate those 2 pieces together, and that's really going to be the central -- that's the central core of our growth story at Monsanto going forward.\n\n---\n\nHugh, I know on Syngenta you can't say too much, but should we take that interest perhaps as signs of, one, either increased interest in crop chemicals; or two, increased confidence by you of the introduction of GM seeds into Europe given recent rulings by the EU?\n\n---\n\nI think -- I don't think there's an awful lot of value in speculation. I've always been a really -- I've always been a big believer on action speaking louder than words. And I think this morning, there's probably 10 billion good reasons why we should be focusing on our growth opportunities. Here's how I would frame it. Since November, since the back end of last year when we announced The Climate Corp. deal, we've been focused and we've talked a lot about the 40 decisions that a grower needs to make when he's producing a crop. And I see clearly in the next 5 years that, that Climate Corp. deal becomes the center of an integrating platform. And if you say, so how does M&A play in that? I think that there's obviously -- we talked, as Pierre mentioned earlier, there's obviously M&A opportunities there. But my guess is more of this is going to be done through partnerships -- partnerships at the seed level; the chemistry, because chemistry then becomes an integrated part in those 40 decisions; fertilizer; machinery; and our key retail partners and how they all come together and now orchestrate a play -- to play a vital part. So when you think about it that way, I don't think this is as much about M&A as much as building that network of partnerships. And I would say this morning, and we've been working on this for a long time. But the decision this morning on this new path, I think is an inflection point for the company. And as you look at future growth, that -- the $10 billion reinvestment in our own-growth story, I think, is more compelling than the M&A argument.\n\n---\n\nVery clear. And you just signed the GM issue in Europe, given that EU have given, I guess, approval to this -- authority to the individual countries to make decisions, as your confidence increases, will we might see GM seeds in Europe the next 3 to 5 years?\n\n---\n\nIn our 5-year growth plan, so as we commit to doubling our EPS, we're not holding our breath on that. I think it's encouraging that member states are going to start choosing their own destiny. But it just moves achingly, achingly slowly. So I think as we think about the growth opportunities ahead in Seeds and Traits, we see very real opportunities in Eastern Europe. We see great opportunities emerging in the Ukraine. But our core growth areas are going to get bigger in the next 5 years. And I don't think Europe is going to play a major part in that in the next 3 to 5.\n\n---\n\nHugh, a question on your growth target. Is growth from the traditional GMO pipeline diminishing as a contributor to earnings growth? Post Intacta, I know you've got a few things in the pipeline, like dicamba tolerance, Corn Rootworm III, and the Yield and Stress, but is that why you're focusing more on the new transformational platforms like precision ag and biologicals?\n\n---\n\nNo. I think -- so we've always been very careful, Don, on what really is an adjacency. And I think The Climate Corp. deal and the biologicals is a natural extension from driving value in-the-bag and driving value simultaneously outside-the-bag. The kind of crunch for us is real simple, how do you deliver more yield to the grower on the same acres over time. And if you look, we talked on this in our Investor Day, if you look forward in the next 10, 20 years, there are no new acres -- 1 or 2 exceptions -- there are no new acres, and then sustainable intensification of yield becomes more and more important. And the way you unlock that in a sustainable basis is by providing better advice to the grower that allows him or her to get more bushels on that same footprint. So you run through exactly our pipeline opportunities, they come in the next half decade to decade. They're all significant opportunities, and during that time, I think we have the opportunity to integrate, as I mentioned earlier, a bunch of other inputs and use them more efficiently to unlock that yield. So I really, really don't see this as an either/or. I see this as both pieces playing together and I think that's the beauty in the strategy and that's what triggered the reinvestment decision and putting $10 billion behind that call.\n\n---\n\nJust 2 clarifications, does biologicals contribute at all to your 2019 earnings growth target? And you say precision ag will be a meaningful contributor. Can you define meaningful or be more quantitative on how you define that?\n\n---\n\nSo, Don, it's a little early for us to give precise numbers regarding the 2019. The number we laid out was the $4 billion from the core business, from the base business, which is really Seeds and Traits only. Actually, biologicals and Climate and the new platforms are separate from this $4 billion. But the microbials by the -- biologicals, by the end of this 5-year period is not going to be very significant. Climate, however, we'll have to do some work there to let you guys think about it. And we'll come back to you at Whistle Stop with maybe a little more detail on how we think about Climate in our projections.\n\n---\n\nCan you talk a little bit about the monetization of Intacta? Specifically, what you're seeing from your Brazilian customer base as we head into next year? And then also, out of your 10 million to 12 million-acre estimate, what expectation, if any, do you have for Argentinian and Latin American south acreage?\n\n---\n\nTwo there, how's the money flowing and acreage outside Brazil. Brett?\n\n---\n\nWell, I think I look at this year with the tremendous performance we had in Intacta meeting or exceeding our yield expectations, and insect control replacement speaks volumes to the performance of the product, which then looking at 10 to 12 million acres next year which is a huge step-up from where we were at 3 million acres this year. So the monetization is going really well. Farmers are seeing the value and they're stepping up to the plate. As to the break-out between Brazil and Argentina, the 10 million to 12 million acres is inclusive of all of it. The vast majority of it will come from Brazil next year. We're just getting started in Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay.\n\n---\n\nAs you move towards getting to $11-plus a share in 2019, how much of that is going to come from share repurchases and how much, let's say, from net income growth?\n\n---\n\nWe see the lion's share of this coming from our core business. And Pierre, maybe a few words on Climate Corp. and how the other pieces layer in?\n\n---\n\nI mean really the -- as Hugh was mentioning, the lion's share of the growth is going to be coming from the business. And past the impact of the original huge buyback we're going to be doing, we are banking on the growth of our business to lay out this target of doubling our EPS and that's really -- on the confidence, actually, we have, that we're going to be able to grow our base business and to grow our earnings during that year, that's one of the key drivers for our decision now to buy back our stock because we think this is one of the best investments we could make, in our own stock basically.\n\n---\n\nAnd as a follow-up, just a couple of credit type questions. What kind of debt rating do you anticipate having as you move through the share repurchase and what kind of interest rate should we use in our modeling for this?\n\n---\n\nSo obviously, the rating agencies will have to do their work and come back to us and come back to the market with the rating about that. It was a priority for us to still be a strong credit rating and we are confident we will be in a good place. But we should hear from the rating agency shortly. So I cannot anticipate on their final ratings.\n\n---\n\nAnd interest rate?\n\n---\n\nThat will depend, obviously, on the credit rating and will depend also on the appetite of the market for our bond.\n\n---\n\nIt's Dan Jester on for P.J. So as you have this 5-year plan, is Climate Corp.'s FieldScripts, are those still U.S.-focused businesses over that whole 5-year period or should we be expecting some geographic expansion to Canada or Latin America or other regions making a contribution over this 5-year period?\n\n---\n\nThe first build-out will be in the U.S. So the encouraging news today of 20 million going to 40 million acres. So it's a great Ground Breakers start. But I would guess by the 5-year period, we'll start to see that build out occurring in our Brazilian and Argentinian markets as well. There's tremendous interest there already.\n\n---\n\nI just had a clarifying question around your comments around capital allocations to Ag Productivity. I wasn't certain whether that was for the overall Ag Productivity segment or just for Roundup? And as kind of a tie-in there, I noticed that one of your partners has announced dicamba production expansion in the U.S. and I was just wondering if we're at a point where you can start talking about whether you anticipate that dicamba would be produced internally or whether there is a higher probability that maybe we should be looking it more towards a JV-type structure?\n\n---\n\nThat's a great distinction. I think the earlier question really related specifically to Roundup. As you look at dicamba, it's hard to call at the moment. But if I was looking ahead, certainly in the next 5 years, I would anticipate there's a likelihood that we would be investing that capital in production. I would anticipate also that our partner, BASF, may as well. And I would expect that beyond us, we'll see increased capacity going in China and in India as well. So there's tremendous anticipation and noise in the market. The Ground Breaker work, the early trials have really lit up the performance of the product. And I think it's an opportunity to upgrade our Roundup Ready 2s one more time. But I would expect that we'll see capital flowing in, in this opportunity from a range of sources.\n\n---\n\nIn the context of your capital structure, could you talk to whether there's strategic or commercial reasons to maintain an A rating or if we should view the new leverage guidance as an indication that Monsanto could be comfortable operating as a BBB credit?\n\n---\n\nWell, I mean, that's pretty much the question I answered. I mean, we cannot share with -- I mean, we don't have obviously the final credit ratings from the credit rating agencies and they will decide. We feel comfortable, based on the work we've been doing, that we'll end up in a good place. But obviously, it's still depending on the credit rating agencies and, as I said, they'll have to do their work and we are expecting them to come back to us fairly shortly.\n\n---\n\nSo there's no strategic or commercial reason, though, from a business perspective to have an A rating?\n\n---\n\nAs I said, we feel, based on our personal work, the work of our teams, that we're in a really good position to run our business going forward.\n\n---\n\nTwo quick questions, one, on the Roundup Ready 2 Xtend, I think you've targeted 65 million acres, could you give us a sense of what that average acre might spend today on secondary herbicide treatment, so we can think about the opportunity set? And then secondly, Pierre, we know you love to be conservative, but I guess if I look at your forecast, you've got Seeds and Traits gross profits growing about 60% in the next 5 years compared to maybe 50% in the prior 5. If you did the math, you could get to a doubling of EPS just from that alone. So, obviously, you're buying back some stock in that time frame, and I think you've talked about having some accretive benefit from some of the new programs. Is there's some offsets that we should think about that limit that growth to only 15% a year?\n\n---\n\nSo on the 6 -- let me start, Bob. On the 65 million, it's probably bigger than that I think. We're chasing 100 million on our Intacta opportunity. You layer 2s on top of that. Brett, I think 65 would be what would be -- using Bob's words on -- 65 million would be a conservative estimate, right?\n\n---\n\nThe North American number.\n\n---\n\nYes. So that would be the U.S. And then any insight on -- to Bob's question on spend, on acre spend or...?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think the way to look at it, Bob, is that will be something that we'll do extensive work on as we get ready to commercialize the product. But a significant number of farmers have moved to multiple molecules on the field, which we have encouraged over the years, to minimize the development of resistant weeds. And the Roundup Ready Xtend program becomes a component within that. But there are farmers using multiple herbicides now to get those multiple modes of action. So there's clearly an opportunity to reduce the number of products that they're using and what they're spending today by substituting in Roundup Ready Xtend. But that's the analysis we're doing now as we look at the product in the field and we'll be more definitive on that as we go forward.\n\n---\n\nAnd maybe answering the second part of your question, Bob. We feel -- as I mentioned, I mean we feel the lion's share of our growth is going to be coming from our core business. That's really the key driver behind the numbers we are laying out and our targets to more than double -- to at least double our EPS going forward. I mean, we are projecting 5 years down the road and, I mean, we've got really good visibility on a couple of things, I mean, and mainly, on our Seeds and Traits business, and that's where the core of the growth is going to be coming with those $4 billion of additional GP we are talking about. But laying out a 5 years target, I mean, I wouldn't say we want to be conservative, but we want to be very realistic about the number we are laying out in front of our investors, so that's one of the reasons we laid out this target, and we actually really feel good about our approach there.\n\n---\n\nI had a couple of questions on your target leverage. So maybe you could talk about how you came up with the 1.5x target leverage range. And it would seem like if you didn't do any M&A, I guess, what I'm trying to get at is, if you didn't do any M&A, are you holding by that 1.5x leverage, where in 2 years you would do more buybacks than the $10 billion to get there?\n\n---\n\nI was just going to say, it's the end of the -- as I mentioned in my remarks, it's the end of 18 months of a lot of careful work and it gives us the ability to continue to invest, as we said earlier, on CapEx and M&A. But Pierre, maybe your view on how you came to the 1.5?\n\n---\n\nSo we came to this 1.5, I mean, thinking about how we were going to be able to operate our business. We wanted to keep room for M&A, as Hugh was mentioning, and investing in our business. So this were really the result of the work we've been doing over the last 18 months. That's how we ended up in this place. And one of the things I'd like to mention is coming from -- I mean, almost minus 0.5 leverage ratio, a negative minus 0.5 leverage ratio, and going to the 1.5 leverage ratio, I mean, we are freeing up 2x our net debt-to-EBITDA and that's worth about $10 billion. So that's really how we came to that and where we feel good about the move we've just made.\n\n---\n\nAnd would you hold by that 1.5x leverage? Is that a rigid target that you'll hit, regardless of M&A opportunities come 2 years from now?\n\n---\n\nSo we've mentioned in the script that we would recalibrate over time, but we feel really good about this number, and that's really the target we have for the foreseeable future.\n\n---\n\nI just wanted to break down in a little bit more detail this $4 billion in growth from Seeds and Traits. If you could sort of break out between soybeans and corn and maybe some of your other crops, where you see the biggest growth drivers?  I know you've talked about the decade of soybean, if you could sort of give us some ballpark guidance, that would be helpful.\n\n---\n\nSo our goal was not to break down the $4 billion by crops because, as we said, there are a number of things that are going to happen and the trajectory may be slightly different from a crop -- on a crop-by-crop basis, but what is really clear to us is that corn will have to play a major role as part of the growth. And if you remember what we laid out during our Investor Day earlier in the year, price only should be able to yield about $1 billion. So if you add volume benefits to that over time, you can get an order of magnitude regarding corn and similarly for soybeans, which is going to be the other key player in this $4 billion. I mean, we laid out at Investor Day as well, of more than $1 billion of revenue -- of GP coming from soybeans. So it kind of gives you the order of magnitude. But as we mentioned, I mean, we are anticipating that our other crops are going to be playing nice parts also in the $4 billion.\n\n---\n\nThe gorgeous thing is we get such a nice hedge between corn and soybeans. When you look this year at the growth in beans, it's still going to be a corn story, but the bean's performance is really a huge contributor as well.\n\n---\n\nIs the $10 billion in announced share repurchase over and above the $1 billion that's remaining from your old share repurchase? And can you make a quick comment on the rise in receivables and inventories year-over-year, which were up about 20%, even though your sales were up about 4%?\n\n---\n\nSo regarding your first question, the answer is yes. So the $10 billion, that is additional to the $1 billion. So that's an easy answer. Regarding our working capital, we announced really early in the year that we were rebuilding our seeds inventories following 2 years of challenging production. So the spike you see in inventories was really expected. Regarding the receivables, it's a combination of factors, one of which being the weight that we've seen in the early days from our Ag Productivity business which is usually collected during the fourth quarter, so this is something we're going to be collecting in the fourth quarter we feel good about. And the second element is just a management decision we made not to use some of our credit facilities' customer financing in the third quarter, we'll use that facility in the fourth quarter. So that's really the high-level story for our receivables' increase.\n\n---\n\nOkay. So let me thank everybody for your patience and for joining us on the call this morning. As you can tell, it's obviously a very important day for us as we've laid out a strategy that guides our growth through the next season, but also for the next 5 years. So let me just conclude this morning by emphasizing a few points.\r\nWe haven't laid out a multiyear target for several years and our ability to do so today is a real statement on the confidence that we have in our core growth, and as our core growth, and the expansion of our strategy as new platforms like The Climate Corporation start defining even more opportunities going forward. And we're backing that confidence today with $10 billion in share buybacks, resulting in a capital structure that I think is a major step forward in our capital allocation and will further strengthen our growth going forward. So we're focused on delivering that opportunity and we look forward to continuing to share our progress with you. And we hope -- we sincerely hope, that many of you will be able to join us in August in the field for our Whistle Stop event, where we will have a first-hand look at this growth story going forward. So thanks very much for your attention and your support this morning.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Vincent Andrews (Analysts)】\nA question on the corn business. I just want to understand both sort of how to connect what's taken place this year, with sort of what's underlying the target out to '19. And I guess, in particular, this year, is there any issue in terms of returns that you are reserved for in the third quarter because of what's gone on with planted acreage in the North or the recent flooding that you just don't know what the numbers are and we might learn more about that in '14? And then as it relates to going forward, as you went through the presentation and we saw some familiar stuff on some of the slides, some of the things that I noticed you didn't mention that I want to understand what your view is going forward, was you've historically talked about the 5% to 10% price mix lift, and you'd also had a target of sort of a $1 billion in sales coming from that. Are those numbers still good, or are we thinking about things differently now?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hugh Grant (Executives)】\nThanks for the question. I think all 3 of us will take a piece of this. Let me start by saying we are -- I think corn had a good year, not a great year. Beans picked up a lot of that slack, but if you look across the Americas, we saw acreage contract, and I think a big piece of our numbers reflects that contraction. And I would say, even with that contraction, we see volume about flat year-on-year. So if you step back, I feel pretty good about the corn performance given the challenges, but maybe ask Brett to say a little bit about the market and then, Pierre, maybe a few words on returns and how you see that playing out in that piece, and mix as well?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Brett Begemann (Executives)】\nYes, thanks, Vince. I think there's a couple of really key points to think about. And it is both this year and as we start to progress into next year. First of all, as we mentioned, we've seen hundreds of millions of dollars lost to less acres and currency this year in our corn business. But as we look at the core of our corn business, that was offset by our mix gains in the various regions and the significant COGS improvement that we expected to get in the U.S. And in the U.S., we remain on target for those. And as Hugh mentioned, along with that, our soybean business is having an absolutely record year, driven by, of course, the new products in soybeans and the build-out of Roundup Ready 2 Yield, but also the portfolio advantage we have as those corn acres shifted to bean acres and we picked up on that. And then also, looking at next year, in the corn business, as you mentioned, we're going to be challenged on COGS in South America with the production issues that we faced in Argentina with the floods that we had late in the year. But I think as I step back and look at it, I feel good about the fundamentals of our corn business and the strength that we have in the fundamental corn business. And that is literally what gives us the confidence to speak to a 5-year plan, where the vast majority of that growth is going to come from our core Seeds and Traits business.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Koort (Analysts)】\nSo, Pierre, maybe a few words on returns?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pierre Courduroux (Executives)】\nYes, maybe to address the specifics of your question, Vincent, regarding returns. As we mentioned during the previous call, last year we got surprised in the fourth quarter with higher returns. I mean, we and the farmers actually got surprised with higher returns related to basically the fact that the market was anticipating 97 million acres planting, and it ended up being on more like 95 million acres. This year, we've been very prudent, I think, and we shouldn't be facing such an issue. And this was one of the reasons, actually, we were anticipating Q3 to be lower than last year in corn. So I mean there's no surprise to that. That's the message we tried to send during the Q2 earnings call and that's what we see today. So we feel very comfortable that during our Q4, we shouldn't see any significant adjustments to our returns.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Vincent Andrews (Analysts)】\nCould you speak to the 5% to 10% price mix uplift and that sort of $1 billion target, are those still good?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pierre Courduroux (Executives)】\nSo as far as the 5% to 10% price mix uplift, what we see this year is, I mean from a margins perspective, we feel really good about the situation in the U.S., where we've seen both the cost of goods upgrades we were anticipating and also the price mix uplift. I mean, it was a more difficult year than we've seen in the past but we've seen very nice price uplift. So we still think this is a key driver of our growth going forward.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kevin McCarthy (Analysts)】\nAs you execute on the $10 billion recapitalization, can you speak to what implications, if any, the new program will have for alternative uses of capital? I'm thinking about trajectory on capital expenditures, SG&A expense and what are your latest thoughts on M&A?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hugh Grant (Executives)】\nI'll maybe ask Pierre to say a few words. Our M&A -- well, let me take a step back and kind of kick this up a piece, Kevin. We see, as Brett made the point in the last question, on our 5-year growth targets, we see the lion's share of that growth coming out of our core. So any growth that we see from Climate Corp. and some of the new platforms, lays on top of that. And then the capital allocation piece leverages that growth. So that's how we're thinking about it. We'll continue on CapEx. We'll continue to invest on building up our plants to drive capacity as we see share gains. I think as you look at The Climate Corp. deal, we see that as a central integrator, and that brings together our seed chemistry opportunities, fertilizer, machinery, and our retail partners. It integrates them around that hub. But within that play, I would assume there's probably still going to be M&A opportunities. And we are looking at keeping powder dry to do that. So I just -- I think with the 5-year view, the key in this is, it's our core business that drives that -- drives the lion's share of that growth.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Brett Begemann (Executives)】\nAnd maybe as a complement to what Hugh just said, I mean you are still looking at a business with strong cash generation, strong free cash generation. So when we made the decision that -- when our board made the decision to vote on this buyback program, we had assessed our potential for growth and the potential for cash generation. So we feel actually very good that we're going to be able to fund our business and the growth that we have in our plan going forward.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kevin McCarthy (Analysts)】\nAs a follow-up, if I may, on the precision ag component of your plan, I think you described it as meaningful. You're over-delivering in the near term on the acreage. Can you talk about what that acreage ramp could look like into fiscal '15 and beyond, and also update us on kind of the economics of your partnership arrangement and how that flows through to Monsanto on a gross and net basis?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hugh Grant (Executives)】\nYes, it's still early for how we're seeing that flow through, Kevin. I would say, we are delighted in the performance this year. So when we lead out a goal and hit the 20 million -- if you draw that against any conventional ramp that we've seen in the last 15 years in our Seeds and Traits business, it surpasses any of that. So growth from 20 million to 40 million acres in the first year, and then see 30 million of that 40 million as real users or users that are using that on a regular basis, it gives us cause for optimism that we're delivering value and that we're growing the consumer experience. But Brett, maybe a few words on how these partners are linking in?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Brett Begemann (Executives)】\nYes, I think, Kevin, as we look at this, it's clearly continuing to build out the platform in the early years, and the contribution will be in the later years of the 5-year plan. I'd say, as Hugh mention, I think this platform is demonstrating that it can be the integrator of bringing together decisions around how the farmer manages his land, his seed choices, his crop protection choices, his fertility programs, his equipment, et cetera, and our goal will be to continue to build out that platform with our partners. And I'm thrilled at this point to have basically all of our large retail partners on board with us. We're in conversations with lots of other potential partners to bring that together. So I continue to look at this as very, very excited, given the success we've had in the early years and the real expression of interest from the farmer level with these early acres, that's huge. The farmers are telling us that they're really interested in it, and the key is their behavior followed what they've been telling us that they were interested in. But the build-out from a financial standpoint will be later in that 5 year plan, Kevin.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Roberts (Analysts)】\nCould you give us the Roundup or the glyphosate price volume trends in the quarter? And do you become capacity constrained in glyphosate any time in this 5 year plan that you've got?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pierre Courduroux (Executives)】\nJohn, I think -- I used to say we're half the business and the Chinese are the other half. We are the smaller half of it now. So we -- I like the strategy. We make what we sell. So we make a bunch of Roundup and we sell everything that we make every year, and that's a pretty good model for a business. And we price, we lay our price in pretty right on top of the generic glyphosate so there's nothing fancy in this. But it works, it's simple and it's served us well this year. Trends in the core -- or Brett, maybe our work done this year versus next year may be helpful.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Brett Begemann (Executives)】\nYes, I don't think that we saw the trends change all that much this year. We started this year saying we would be flat to up through the year and as I look to the future, I expect Roundup to be flat to down going forwards versus the uptrend and we see that playing out in the marketplace going through next year. So I don't see significant movement on that going forwards to next year, but the trend would be flat to down. But again, it's in a supporting role of our core Seeds and Traits business and as Hugh said, we sell out of Roundup every year and we're going to focus on our core Seeds and Traits.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Roberts (Analysts)】\nYou wouldn't expect any significant capital then to go to that business, I would suspect, over this 5-year plan?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hugh Grant (Executives)】\nNo, we would not. And that's a great segue, John. Today, we announced a 5-year goal of doubling EPS, we see significant growth in the business. Roundup is a great product, it's a great cash generator. But from where in 2019 looking back, it's going to be our Seeds and Traits business that really drives that growth as the integration of The Climate Corp. platform and how we integrate those 2 pieces together, and that's really going to be the central -- that's the central core of our growth story at Monsanto going forward.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Begleiter (Analysts)】\nHugh, I know on Syngenta you can't say too much, but should we take that interest perhaps as signs of, one, either increased interest in crop chemicals; or two, increased confidence by you of the introduction of GM seeds into Europe given recent rulings by the EU?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hugh Grant (Executives)】\nI think -- I don't think there's an awful lot of value in speculation. I've always been a really -- I've always been a big believer on action speaking louder than words. And I think this morning, there's probably 10 billion good reasons why we should be focusing on our growth opportunities. Here's how I would frame it. Since November, since the back end of last year when we announced The Climate Corp. deal, we've been focused and we've talked a lot about the 40 decisions that a grower needs to make when he's producing a crop. And I see clearly in the next 5 years that, that Climate Corp. deal becomes the center of an integrating platform. And if you say, so how does M&A play in that? I think that there's obviously -- we talked, as Pierre mentioned earlier, there's obviously M&A opportunities there. But my guess is more of this is going to be done through partnerships -- partnerships at the seed level; the chemistry, because chemistry then becomes an integrated part in those 40 decisions; fertilizer; machinery; and our key retail partners and how they all come together and now orchestrate a play -- to play a vital part. So when you think about it that way, I don't think this is as much about M&A as much as building that network of partnerships. And I would say this morning, and we've been working on this for a long time. But the decision this morning on this new path, I think is an inflection point for the company. And as you look at future growth, that -- the $10 billion reinvestment in our own-growth story, I think, is more compelling than the M&A argument.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Begleiter (Analysts)】\nVery clear. And you just signed the GM issue in Europe, given that EU have given, I guess, approval to this -- authority to the individual countries to make decisions, as your confidence increases, will we might see GM seeds in Europe the next 3 to 5 years?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hugh Grant (Executives)】\nIn our 5-year growth plan, so as we commit to doubling our EPS, we're not holding our breath on that. I think it's encouraging that member states are going to start choosing their own destiny. But it just moves achingly, achingly slowly. So I think as we think about the growth opportunities ahead in Seeds and Traits, we see very real opportunities in Eastern Europe. We see great opportunities emerging in the Ukraine. But our core growth areas are going to get bigger in the next 5 years. And I don't think Europe is going to play a major part in that in the next 3 to 5.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Donald Carson (Analysts)】\nHugh, a question on your growth target. Is growth from the traditional GMO pipeline diminishing as a contributor to earnings growth? Post Intacta, I know you've got a few things in the pipeline, like dicamba tolerance, Corn Rootworm III, and the Yield and Stress, but is that why you're focusing more on the new transformational platforms like precision ag and biologicals?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hugh Grant (Executives)】\nNo. I think -- so we've always been very careful, Don, on what really is an adjacency. And I think The Climate Corp. deal and the biologicals is a natural extension from driving value in-the-bag and driving value simultaneously outside-the-bag. The kind of crunch for us is real simple, how do you deliver more yield to the grower on the same acres over time. And if you look, we talked on this in our Investor Day, if you look forward in the next 10, 20 years, there are no new acres -- 1 or 2 exceptions -- there are no new acres, and then sustainable intensification of yield becomes more and more important. And the way you unlock that in a sustainable basis is by providing better advice to the grower that allows him or her to get more bushels on that same footprint. So you run through exactly our pipeline opportunities, they come in the next half decade to decade. They're all significant opportunities, and during that time, I think we have the opportunity to integrate, as I mentioned earlier, a bunch of other inputs and use them more efficiently to unlock that yield. So I really, really don't see this as an either/or. I see this as both pieces playing together and I think that's the beauty in the strategy and that's what triggered the reinvestment decision and putting $10 billion behind that call.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Donald Carson (Analysts)】\nJust 2 clarifications, does biologicals contribute at all to your 2019 earnings growth target? And you say precision ag will be a meaningful contributor. Can you define meaningful or be more quantitative on how you define that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pierre Courduroux (Executives)】\nSo, Don, it's a little early for us to give precise numbers regarding the 2019. The number we laid out was the $4 billion from the core business, from the base business, which is really Seeds and Traits only. Actually, biologicals and Climate and the new platforms are separate from this $4 billion. But the microbials by the -- biologicals, by the end of this 5-year period is not going to be very significant. Climate, however, we'll have to do some work there to let you guys think about it. And we'll come back to you at Whistle Stop with maybe a little more detail on how we think about Climate in our projections.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Christopher Parkinson (Analysts)】\nCan you talk a little bit about the monetization of Intacta? Specifically, what you're seeing from your Brazilian customer base as we head into next year? And then also, out of your 10 million to 12 million-acre estimate, what expectation, if any, do you have for Argentinian and Latin American south acreage?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hugh Grant (Executives)】\nTwo there, how's the money flowing and acreage outside Brazil. Brett?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Brett Begemann (Executives)】\nWell, I think I look at this year with the tremendous performance we had in Intacta meeting or exceeding our yield expectations, and insect control replacement speaks volumes to the performance of the product, which then looking at 10 to 12 million acres next year which is a huge step-up from where we were at 3 million acres this year. So the monetization is going really well. Farmers are seeing the value and they're stepping up to the plate. As to the break-out between Brazil and Argentina, the 10 million to 12 million acres is inclusive of all of it. The vast majority of it will come from Brazil next year. We're just getting started in Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Gulley (Analysts)】\nAs you move towards getting to $11-plus a share in 2019, how much of that is going to come from share repurchases and how much, let's say, from net income growth?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hugh Grant (Executives)】\nWe see the lion's share of this coming from our core business. And Pierre, maybe a few words on Climate Corp. and how the other pieces layer in?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pierre Courduroux (Executives)】\nI mean really the -- as Hugh was mentioning, the lion's share of the growth is going to be coming from the business. And past the impact of the original huge buyback we're going to be doing, we are banking on the growth of our business to lay out this target of doubling our EPS and that's really -- on the confidence, actually, we have, that we're going to be able to grow our base business and to grow our earnings during that year, that's one of the key drivers for our decision now to buy back our stock because we think this is one of the best investments we could make, in our own stock basically.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Gulley (Analysts)】\nAnd as a follow-up, just a couple of credit type questions. What kind of debt rating do you anticipate having as you move through the share repurchase and what kind of interest rate should we use in our modeling for this?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pierre Courduroux (Executives)】\nSo obviously, the rating agencies will have to do their work and come back to us and come back to the market with the rating about that. It was a priority for us to still be a strong credit rating and we are confident we will be in a good place. But we should hear from the rating agency shortly. So I cannot anticipate on their final ratings.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Gulley (Analysts)】\nAnd interest rate?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pierre Courduroux (Executives)】\nThat will depend, obviously, on the credit rating and will depend also on the appetite of the market for our bond.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Jester (Analysts)】\nIt's Dan Jester on for P.J. So as you have this 5-year plan, is Climate Corp.'s FieldScripts, are those still U.S.-focused businesses over that whole 5-year period or should we be expecting some geographic expansion to Canada or Latin America or other regions making a contribution over this 5-year period?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hugh Grant (Executives)】\nThe first build-out will be in the U.S. So the encouraging news today of 20 million going to 40 million acres. So it's a great Ground Breakers start. But I would guess by the 5-year period, we'll start to see that build out occurring in our Brazilian and Argentinian markets as well. There's tremendous interest there already.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Tim Tiberio (Analysts)】\nI just had a clarifying question around your comments around capital allocations to Ag Productivity. I wasn't certain whether that was for the overall Ag Productivity segment or just for Roundup? And as kind of a tie-in there, I noticed that one of your partners has announced dicamba production expansion in the U.S. and I was just wondering if we're at a point where you can start talking about whether you anticipate that dicamba would be produced internally or whether there is a higher probability that maybe we should be looking it more towards a JV-type structure?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hugh Grant (Executives)】\nThat's a great distinction. I think the earlier question really related specifically to Roundup. As you look at dicamba, it's hard to call at the moment. But if I was looking ahead, certainly in the next 5 years, I would anticipate there's a likelihood that we would be investing that capital in production. I would anticipate also that our partner, BASF, may as well. And I would expect that beyond us, we'll see increased capacity going in China and in India as well. So there's tremendous anticipation and noise in the market. The Ground Breaker work, the early trials have really lit up the performance of the product. And I think it's an opportunity to upgrade our Roundup Ready 2s one more time. But I would expect that we'll see capital flowing in, in this opportunity from a range of sources.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Carly Mattson (Analysts)】\nIn the context of your capital structure, could you talk to whether there's strategic or commercial reasons to maintain an A rating or if we should view the new leverage guidance as an indication that Monsanto could be comfortable operating as a BBB credit?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pierre Courduroux (Executives)】\nWell, I mean, that's pretty much the question I answered. I mean, we cannot share with -- I mean, we don't have obviously the final credit ratings from the credit rating agencies and they will decide. We feel comfortable, based on the work we've been doing, that we'll end up in a good place. But obviously, it's still depending on the credit rating agencies and, as I said, they'll have to do their work and we are expecting them to come back to us fairly shortly.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\nSo there's no strategic or commercial reason, though, from a business perspective to have an A rating?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pierre Courduroux (Executives)】\nAs I said, we feel, based on our personal work, the work of our teams, that we're in a really good position to run our business going forward.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Koort (Analysts)】\nTwo quick questions, one, on the Roundup Ready 2 Xtend, I think you've targeted 65 million acres, could you give us a sense of what that average acre might spend today on secondary herbicide treatment, so we can think about the opportunity set? And then secondly, Pierre, we know you love to be conservative, but I guess if I look at your forecast, you've got Seeds and Traits gross profits growing about 60% in the next 5 years compared to maybe 50% in the prior 5. If you did the math, you could get to a doubling of EPS just from that alone. So, obviously, you're buying back some stock in that time frame, and I think you've talked about having some accretive benefit from some of the new programs. Is there's some offsets that we should think about that limit that growth to only 15% a year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hugh Grant (Executives)】\nSo on the 6 -- let me start, Bob. On the 65 million, it's probably bigger than that I think. We're chasing 100 million on our Intacta opportunity. You layer 2s on top of that. Brett, I think 65 would be what would be -- using Bob's words on -- 65 million would be a conservative estimate, right?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Brett Begemann (Executives)】\nThe North American number.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hugh Grant (Executives)】\nYes. So that would be the U.S. And then any insight on -- to Bob's question on spend, on acre spend or...?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Brett Begemann (Executives)】\nYes, I think the way to look at it, Bob, is that will be something that we'll do extensive work on as we get ready to commercialize the product. But a significant number of farmers have moved to multiple molecules on the field, which we have encouraged over the years, to minimize the development of resistant weeds. And the Roundup Ready Xtend program becomes a component within that. But there are farmers using multiple herbicides now to get those multiple modes of action. So there's clearly an opportunity to reduce the number of products that they're using and what they're spending today by substituting in Roundup Ready Xtend. But that's the analysis we're doing now as we look at the product in the field and we'll be more definitive on that as we go forward.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pierre Courduroux (Executives)】\nAnd maybe answering the second part of your question, Bob. We feel -- as I mentioned, I mean we feel the lion's share of our growth is going to be coming from our core business. That's really the key driver behind the numbers we are laying out and our targets to more than double -- to at least double our EPS going forward. I mean, we are projecting 5 years down the road and, I mean, we've got really good visibility on a couple of things, I mean, and mainly, on our Seeds and Traits business, and that's where the core of the growth is going to be coming with those $4 billion of additional GP we are talking about. But laying out a 5 years target, I mean, I wouldn't say we want to be conservative, but we want to be very realistic about the number we are laying out in front of our investors, so that's one of the reasons we laid out this target, and we actually really feel good about our approach there.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Joel Jackson (Analysts)】\nI had a couple of questions on your target leverage. So maybe you could talk about how you came up with the 1.5x target leverage range. And it would seem like if you didn't do any M&A, I guess, what I'm trying to get at is, if you didn't do any M&A, are you holding by that 1.5x leverage, where in 2 years you would do more buybacks than the $10 billion to get there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hugh Grant (Executives)】\nI was just going to say, it's the end of the -- as I mentioned in my remarks, it's the end of 18 months of a lot of careful work and it gives us the ability to continue to invest, as we said earlier, on CapEx and M&A. But Pierre, maybe your view on how you came to the 1.5?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pierre Courduroux (Executives)】\nSo we came to this 1.5, I mean, thinking about how we were going to be able to operate our business. We wanted to keep room for M&A, as Hugh was mentioning, and investing in our business. So this were really the result of the work we've been doing over the last 18 months. That's how we ended up in this place. And one of the things I'd like to mention is coming from -- I mean, almost minus 0.5 leverage ratio, a negative minus 0.5 leverage ratio, and going to the 1.5 leverage ratio, I mean, we are freeing up 2x our net debt-to-EBITDA and that's worth about $10 billion. So that's really how we came to that and where we feel good about the move we've just made.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Joel Jackson (Analysts)】\nAnd would you hold by that 1.5x leverage? Is that a rigid target that you'll hit, regardless of M&A opportunities come 2 years from now?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pierre Courduroux (Executives)】\nSo we've mentioned in the script that we would recalibrate over time, but we feel really good about this number, and that's really the target we have for the foreseeable future.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Piken (Analysts)】\nI just wanted to break down in a little bit more detail this $4 billion in growth from Seeds and Traits. If you could sort of break out between soybeans and corn and maybe some of your other crops, where you see the biggest growth drivers?  I know you've talked about the decade of soybean, if you could sort of give us some ballpark guidance, that would be helpful.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pierre Courduroux (Executives)】\nSo our goal was not to break down the $4 billion by crops because, as we said, there are a number of things that are going to happen and the trajectory may be slightly different from a crop -- on a crop-by-crop basis, but what is really clear to us is that corn will have to play a major role as part of the growth. And if you remember what we laid out during our Investor Day earlier in the year, price only should be able to yield about $1 billion. So if you add volume benefits to that over time, you can get an order of magnitude regarding corn and similarly for soybeans, which is going to be the other key player in this $4 billion. I mean, we laid out at Investor Day as well, of more than $1 billion of revenue -- of GP coming from soybeans. So it kind of gives you the order of magnitude. But as we mentioned, I mean, we are anticipating that our other crops are going to be playing nice parts also in the $4 billion.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hugh Grant (Executives)】\nThe gorgeous thing is we get such a nice hedge between corn and soybeans. When you look this year at the growth in beans, it's still going to be a corn story, but the bean's performance is really a huge contributor as well.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jeffrey Zekauskas (Analysts)】\nIs the $10 billion in announced share repurchase over and above the $1 billion that's remaining from your old share repurchase? And can you make a quick comment on the rise in receivables and inventories year-over-year, which were up about 20%, even though your sales were up about 4%?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pierre Courduroux (Executives)】\nSo regarding your first question, the answer is yes. So the $10 billion, that is additional to the $1 billion. So that's an easy answer. Regarding our working capital, we announced really early in the year that we were rebuilding our seeds inventories following 2 years of challenging production. So the spike you see in inventories was really expected. Regarding the receivables, it's a combination of factors, one of which being the weight that we've seen in the early days from our Ag Productivity business which is usually collected during the fourth quarter, so this is something we're going to be collecting in the fourth quarter we feel good about. And the second element is just a management decision we made not to use some of our credit facilities' customer financing in the third quarter, we'll use that facility in the fourth quarter. So that's really the high-level story for our receivables' increase.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hugh Grant (Executives)】\nOkay. So let me thank everybody for your patience and for joining us on the call this morning. As you can tell, it's obviously a very important day for us as we've laid out a strategy that guides our growth through the next season, but also for the next 5 years. So let me just conclude this morning by emphasizing a few points.\r\nWe haven't laid out a multiyear target for several years and our ability to do so today is a real statement on the confidence that we have in our core growth, and as our core growth, and the expansion of our strategy as new platforms like The Climate Corporation start defining even more opportunities going forward. And we're backing that confidence today with $10 billion in share buybacks, resulting in a capital structure that I think is a major step forward in our capital allocation and will further strengthen our growth going forward. So we're focused on delivering that opportunity and we look forward to continuing to share our progress with you. And we hope -- we sincerely hope, that many of you will be able to join us in August in the field for our Whistle Stop event, where we will have a first-hand look at this growth story going forward. So thanks very much for your attention and your support this morning.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you, Chelsea. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle's Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2014 Earnings Conference Call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information, can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website. \r\nOn the call today are Chief Executive Officer, Larry Ellison; President and CFO, Safra Catz; and President, Mark Hurd. As a reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward looking. \r\nThroughout today's discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business, which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements made today. As a result, we caution you from placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, and we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments, for a complete discussion of these factors and other factors that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. \r\nAnd finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or publicly release any revisions to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. \r\nAnd with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. As you can see, we've made some significant changes in our financial reporting and in our guidance to match our company's fundamental transition. We are now firmly into the transition to the cloud, and though we had previously disclosed our SaaS revenues in the 10-Ks and Qs, as the cloud revenue has become larger and more significant, we've gone ahead and disclosed them on the face of our income statement. \r\nYou may want to actually take out your income statement as we go through this just so that you can follow me. What we previously reported as new software license and cloud subscription is now reported on 2 separate lines: new software license and another line for cloud Software as a Service and Platform as a Service, SaaS and PaaS. At this time, the bulk of the revenue is Software as a Service, but we expect Platform as a Service to become very important as we do the full launch of Platform as a Service this fall. Also, we previously reported in service -- what we previously reported in services is now reported on 2 separate lines: cloud Infrastructure as a Service, IaaS; and services. \r\nWe have summed new software license, SaaS and PaaS, IaaS and software license updates and product support as a total called Software and Cloud revenue. Our services net -- line now includes Consulting, Advanced Customer Support Services and Education. The expense lines were also broken out in more detail where appropriate. \r\nSo to start, I'm going to go over the Q4 results with our new detail and then sum it up using our old disclosure for comparability to my previous guidance. Then I'll move on to the guidance for Q1. Generally, I'll be using non-GAAP measures in constant currency unless otherwise stated but will point out GAAP numbers or U.S. dollar growth rates when the difference is important for comparability to last year.\r\nSo using our new reporting, Software and Cloud revenue totaled a record $8.9 billion in Q4, growing 4%. New software license was $3.8 billion, flat in U.S. dollars, declining 1% in constant currency, while new software license application revenues were up 6%. \r\nCloud SaaS and PaaS were $327 million, growing 23%. Cloud Infrastructure as a Service was $128 million, growing 13%. Software license updates and product support was $4.7 billion, growing 6% in constant currency and 7% in U.S. dollars. Software support attach and renewal rates were strong as usual. \r\nTo most closely compare these numbers to my guidance last earnings call, new software license and cloud SaaS and PaaS added together were $4.1 billion, up 1% in constant currency and 2% in U.S. dollars. With our new presentation, you can see that our on-premise-based software business, which is new software license and software license updates and product support, has steadily grown over time to $8.5 billion this quarter. On top of that, we're building our SaaS, PaaS and IaaS cloud business, which grew nearly 20% and is already approaching a $2 billion run rate, with $455 million in revenue this quarter. \r\nHardware system revenue was nearly $1.5 billion, growing 3% on a GAAP basis and 2% on a non-GAAP basis. Hardware products were $870 million, growing 3%, and hardware support was nearly $600 million, growing 2%. Engineered Systems had another good quarter with double-digit growth and represents 1/3 of hardware product sales. In addition, we saw very strong growth in NAS storage in the quarter. \r\nHardware product gross margins were 49%, down 2 points -- about 2 points from last year as we continue to put more value in our product without raising prices, thus grabbing significant market share as all our major competitors shrink. Keep in mind that as we've increased hardware support attach rates, hardware support margins have steadily improved, and total hardware systems margins are unchanged from last year at 66%. \r\nFor the company, total revenue for the quarter was $11.3 billion, up 3% from last year. Operating income was $5.8 billion, up 2% in constant currency, 3% in U.S. dollars. Operating margin was 51%, same as last year. \r\nUnlike new software license transactions, where we recognize the revenue upfront, we recognize the revenue from cloud software over time. In the short term -- in the short run, it delays revenue, but over the medium and long term, we can expect more revenues as we do more of the work for our customers, while our customers can expect to pay substantially less in total with savings in the form of large reductions in the cost of implementing and running their own system. Over time, this contributes to our business model, particularly given our differentiated products in each of SaaS, PaaS and IaaS. \r\nAs we get to the operating income line, I want to remind you that our GAAP operating income last year benefited from a $269 million reduction in the purchase price of an acquisition. This was entirely excluded from a non-GAAP purpose but did show up in our GAAP -- in the GAAP numbers, which flow all the way through. \r\nIn addition, both on GAAP and non-GAAP results include another foreign currency loss this quarter, this time for $102 million from the devaluation of our Venezuelan net assets compared to the dollar. This, of course, was not included in my guidance last quarter. Our net asset values in Venezuela have now devalued so much that it will not have any meaningful impact on our numbers going forward. Were it not for the Venezuela currency loss, EPS would have been $0.02 higher. \r\nThe non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 23%. The GAAP tax rate was 20.5%. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.92, up from $0.87 last year. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.80, unchanged because last year our GAAP EPS was helped by the $0.04 reduction in the purchase price for the acquisition I just mentioned. \r\nSo I want to make sure I said that correctly so you understand what happened. We got a $0.04 benefit last year in our GAAP EPS. This year, we obviously don't have that benefit, and without that benefit, it would have been $0.76, not $0.80. \r\nOperating cash flow increased $14.9 billion, and free cash flow grew to $14.3 billion over the last 4 quarters, both the record Q4 results. For the fiscal year 2014, total Software and Cloud revenue totaled a record $29.2 billion, growing 5% in constant currency. \r\nNew software license was $9.4 billion, up 1%. Cloud SaaS and PaaS were $1.1 billion, growing 20% non-GAAP and 24% GAAP. Cloud Infrastructure as a Service was $456 million, growing 1%. Software support was $18.2 billion, growing 7%. Hardware system revenue was nearly $5.4 billion, growing 2%. Of that, hardware products were $3 billion, down 1% for the year. And hardware support was $2.4 billion, growing 5% for the year. \r\nServices revenue was $3.7 billion, declining 4% as a result of the continuing move of our Consulting business to shorter, faster, cheaper engagement for our customers as they move to the cloud. \r\nTotal revenue grew 4% to a record $38.3 billion. Our non-GAAP operating margin for the full year was 47%. Earnings per share were $2.87, growing 8%. We've successfully grown the company's revenues and earnings through every transition, whether it was minicomputer database to a complete suite of products, client/server to Internet, commodity hardware to Engineered Systems and now on-premise to cloud. We are well on our way into our most recent transition. \r\nWe have nearly $39 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is more than $14 billion. Deferred revenue now stands at $7.3 billion, up 2% from last year. In Q4, we repurchased more than 49 million shares for a total of $2 billion, and for the full year, we repurchased nearly 281 million shares for a total of more than $9.8 billion. And the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share. Between dividends and buyback, this year we returned nearly $12 billion or more than 80% of our free cash flow to our shareholders.\r\nNow let's move to the guidance. Software and Cloud revenue on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, which includes new software license, software support, SaaS and PaaS and IaaS, is expected to grow 6% to 8% in U.S. dollars, 5% to 7% in constant currency. SaaS and PaaS, one of the line items, on a non-GAAP basis is expected to grow 25% to 35% in U.S. dollars, 24% to 34% in constant currency. SaaS and PaaS on a GAAP basis is expected to grow 27% to 37% in U.S. dollars, 26% to 36% in constant currency. \r\nNow another one of the lines, cloud IaaS on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis is expected to grow 10% to 20% in U.S. dollars and 9% to 19% in constant currency. Hardware system revenue on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, which includes hardware systems products and hardware systems support, is expected to be between negative 1% and positive 3% or negative 2% to positive 2% in constant currency.\r\nTotal revenue on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 4% to 6% in U.S. dollars and 3% to 5% in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be somewhere between $0.62 and $0.66 in U.S. dollars, $0.61 and $0.65 in constant currency. GAAP EPS is expected to be somewhere between $0.49 and $0.53 in U.S. dollars and $0.48 to $0.52 in constant currency. Now this guidance assumes a GAAP tax rate of 22% and a non-GAAP tax rate of 23.5%. Of course, it may end up being different. \r\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Larry.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Safra. Okay. Oracle is focused, focused like a laser on one goal over the next few years, becoming the #1 company in cloud computing's 2 most profitable segments: Software as a Service, SaaS; and Platform as a Service, PaaS. \r\nWe expect to become #1 for 3 reasons: first, we have the most complete and modern portfolio of SaaS products in the cloud: CRM sales, CRM service, marketing. In Human Capital Management, we have core human resources: recruiting, talent management and payroll. In ERP, we have accounting, procurement, supply chain, project management and more, the most comprehensive suite of products in the cloud by far. \r\nSecond, all of those SaaS applications run on the world's most powerful platform in the cloud, the Oracle in-memory multitenant database and the world's most popular programming language, Java.\r\nThird, we have dramatically expanded, specialized and lined up our sales forces to sell SaaS and PaaS subscriptions against the new generation of cloud software competitors, and it's working. As we enter our new fiscal year, we're already #2 in overall SaaS subscription sales. In FY '15, our plan is to grow our SaaS bookings over 50%.\r\nThat will allow us to close in on the #1 spot. We already have a huge lead over Workday in cloud ERP. We acquired 120 new cloud ERP customers in Q4 alone. In HCM, we are dominating Workday in Europe and beating them in dozens of core HCM deals here in North America. Mark will give you some of the details and highlights regarding our cloud wins and our great Q4 quarter in the cloud. Mark?\n\n---\n\nThanks, Larry. Let me just actually start with hardware a little bit. We're now roughly in the middle of transitioning our hardware business. Engineered Systems were our strategy and now a significant part of our hardware. We've grown hardware for the second quarter in a row. \r\nThe change in mix away from commodity hardware to high-value Engineered Systems have transformed the business to an integrated Engineered Systems business that brings with it extremely attractive annuity. \r\nLet me give you some facts about hardware. Engineered Systems grew to record levels in Q4, while our competitors, as Safra described, are declining. We will ship our 10,000th Engineered System in Q1. We're at scale. Our hardware support margins are now approaching 70%, and this business is sticky. SPARC SuperCluster bookings grew triple-digits. Exalytics, Big Data Appliance and Oracle Database Appliance all grew double-digits. Oracle has become the hardware company, taking share, growing and doing it profitably. And as I said, we're in the middle of the transition. \r\nNow I'll talk about cloud. We're actually just starting this transition. We're the only company that has a whole suite of cloud applications. We're salesforce.com's primary competitor, Workday's primary competitor. And in a cloud, we're many times the size of Workday. We're bigger than SAP, and we're going to pass salesforce in the cloud. \r\nLet me run a few facts about you -- about our cloud. As industry analysts build their waves and quadrants, they need cloud leaders in specific cloud areas, and Oracle today is the leader across more cloud solutions than salesforce, Workday and SAP combined. Cloud bookings grew 37% last year. Q4 was the best ever for bookings. \r\nFusion cloud bookings growth were 3x the overall growth rate. Fusion HCM, ERP and Salesforce Automation revenue all grew triple-digits. We added 870 cloud customers in Q4, including in HCM nearly 320 customers, with Fusion 110 HCM customers. If I take Workday's reported number of 75 new customers, we're adding customers at 4 to 5x the pace of Workday. In Customer Experience, we added 430 customers, with 120-plus Fusion Salesforce Automation wins. \r\nWith BlueKai now on board, along with Eloqua and Responsys, we're the clear #1 in marketing automation, with bookings growth of 200% this quarter. In Salesforce Automation, bookings grew more than 80%, and revenue was up triple-digits. As Larry referenced, we added 120 ERP cloud customers in the quarter, all Fusion. In just Q4, we added more ERP cloud customers than Workday's total customer base for financials. More than 70 customer go lives just this quarter, with hundreds already live. \r\nWe're about to deliver release 9 of Fusion this summer. With Fusion, we have built the most attractive cloud solution in the industry. We've acquired the most attractive SaaS companies in the industry. We're already #1 or #2 in every SaaS category, and we won't stop until we're #1 in every category. \r\nJust like hardware, where we focused on Engineered Systems, in software, we are focused on the cloud. We're executing, we're winning and we're going to be #1. \r\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over for questions.\n\n---\n\nBefore we go to questions, Chelsea, I want to call out that we understand that some of you may have difficulty hearing parts of Mark's comments. So we'll continue to move forward with the call, and we will try to address some of Mark's comments into the Q&A. Chelsea, if you could start the Q&A, please?",

At this time, the bulk of the revenue is Software as a Service, but we expect Platform as a Service to become very important as we do the full launch of Platform as a Service this fall. Also, we previously reported in service -- what we previously reported in services is now reported on 2 separate lines: cloud Infrastructure as a Service, IaaS; and services. \r\nWe have summed new software license, SaaS and PaaS, IaaS and software license updates and product support as a total called Software and Cloud revenue. Our services net -- line now includes Consulting, Advanced Customer Support Services and Education. The expense lines were also broken out in more detail where appropriate. \r\nSo to start, I'm going to go over the Q4 results with our new detail and then sum it up using our old disclosure for comparability to my previous guidance. Then I'll move on to the guidance for Q1. Generally, I'll be using non-GAAP measures in constant currency unless otherwise stated but will point out GAAP numbers or U.S. dollar growth rates when the difference is important for comparability to last year.\r\nSo using our new reporting, Software and Cloud revenue totaled a record $8.9 billion in Q4, growing 4%. New software license was $3.8 billion, flat in U.S. dollars, declining 1% in constant currency, while new software license application revenues were up 6%. \r\nCloud SaaS and PaaS were $327 million, growing 23%. Cloud Infrastructure as a Service was $128 million, growing 13%. Software license updates and product support was $4.7 billion, growing 6% in constant currency and 7% in U.S. dollars. Software support attach and renewal rates were strong as usual. \r\nTo most closely compare these numbers to my guidance last earnings call, new software license and cloud SaaS and PaaS added together were $4.1 billion, up 1% in constant currency and 2% in U.S. dollars. With our new presentation, you can see that our on-premise-based software business, which is new software license and software license updates and product support, has steadily grown over time to $8.5 billion this quarter. On top of that, we're building our SaaS, PaaS and IaaS cloud business, which grew nearly 20% and is already approaching a $2 billion run rate, with $455 million in revenue this quarter. \r\nHardware system revenue was nearly $1.5 billion, growing 3% on a GAAP basis and 2% on a non-GAAP basis. Hardware products were $870 million, growing 3%, and hardware support was nearly $600 million, growing 2%. Engineered Systems had another good quarter with double-digit growth and represents 1/3 of hardware product sales. In addition, we saw very strong growth in NAS storage in the quarter. \r\nHardware product gross margins were 49%, down 2 points -- about 2 points from last year as we continue to put more value in our product without raising prices, thus grabbing significant market share as all our major competitors shrink. Keep in mind that as we've increased hardware support attach rates, hardware support margins have steadily improved, and total hardware systems margins are unchanged from last year at 66%. \r\nFor the company, total revenue for the quarter was $11.3 billion, up 3% from last year. Operating income was $5.8 billion, up 2% in constant currency, 3% in U.S. dollars. Operating margin was 51%, same as last year. \r\nUnlike new software license transactions, where we recognize the revenue upfront, we recognize the revenue from cloud software over time. In the short term -- in the short run, it delays revenue, but over the medium and long term, we can expect more revenues as we do more of the work for our customers, while our customers can expect to pay substantially less in total with savings in the form of large reductions in the cost of implementing and running their own system. Over time, this contributes to our business model, particularly given our differentiated products in each of SaaS, PaaS and IaaS. \r\nAs we get to the operating income line, I want to remind you that our GAAP operating income last year benefited from a $269 million reduction in the purchase price of an acquisition. This was entirely excluded from a non-GAAP purpose but did show up in our GAAP -- in the GAAP numbers, which flow all the way through. \r\nIn addition, both on GAAP and non-GAAP results include another foreign currency loss this quarter, this time for $102 million from the devaluation of our Venezuelan net assets compared to the dollar. This, of course, was not included in my guidance last quarter. Our net asset values in Venezuela have now devalued so much that it will not have any meaningful impact on our numbers going forward. Were it not for the Venezuela currency loss, EPS would have been $0.02 higher. \r\nThe non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 23%. The GAAP tax rate was 20.5%. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.92, up from $0.87 last year. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.80, unchanged because last year our GAAP EPS was helped by the $0.04 reduction in the purchase price for the acquisition I just mentioned. \r\nSo I want to make sure I said that correctly so you understand what happened. We got a $0.04 benefit last year in our GAAP EPS. This year, we obviously don't have that benefit, and without that benefit, it would have been $0.76, not $0.80. \r\nOperating cash flow increased $14.9 billion, and free cash flow grew to $14.3 billion over the last 4 quarters, both the record Q4 results. For the fiscal year 2014, total Software and Cloud revenue totaled a record $29.2 billion, growing 5% in constant currency. \r\nNew software license was $9.4 billion, up 1%. Cloud SaaS and PaaS were $1.1 billion, growing 20% non-GAAP and 24% GAAP. Cloud Infrastructure as a Service was $456 million, growing 1%. Software support was $18.2 billion, growing 7%. Hardware system revenue was nearly $5.4 billion, growing 2%. Of that, hardware products were $3 billion, down 1% for the year. And hardware support was $2.4 billion, growing 5% for the year. \r\nServices revenue was $3.7 billion, declining 4% as a result of the continuing move of our Consulting business to shorter, faster, cheaper engagement for our customers as they move to the cloud. \r\nTotal revenue grew 4% to a record $38.3 billion. Our non-GAAP operating margin for the full year was 47%. Earnings per share were $2.87, growing 8%. We've successfully grown the company's revenues and earnings through every transition, whether it was minicomputer database to a complete suite of products, client/server to Internet, commodity hardware to Engineered Systems and now on-premise to cloud. We are well on our way into our most recent transition. \r\nWe have nearly $39 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is more than $14 billion. Deferred revenue now stands at $7.3 billion, up 2% from last year. In Q4, we repurchased more than 49 million shares for a total of $2 billion, and for the full year, we repurchased nearly 281 million shares for a total of more than $9.8 billion. And the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share. Between dividends and buyback, this year we returned nearly $12 billion or more than 80% of our free cash flow to our shareholders.\r\nNow let's move to the guidance. Software and Cloud revenue on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, which includes new software license, software support, SaaS and PaaS and IaaS, is expected to grow 6% to 8% in U.S. dollars, 5% to 7% in constant currency. SaaS and PaaS, one of the line items, on a non-GAAP basis is expected to grow 25% to 35% in U.S. dollars, 24% to 34% in constant currency. SaaS and PaaS on a GAAP basis is expected to grow 27% to 37% in U.S. dollars, 26% to 36% in constant currency. \r\nNow another one of the lines, cloud IaaS on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis is expected to grow 10% to 20% in U.S. dollars and 9% to 19% in constant currency. Hardware system revenue on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, which includes hardware systems products and hardware systems support, is expected to be between negative 1% and positive 3% or negative 2% to positive 2% in constant currency.\r\nTotal revenue on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 4% to 6% in U.S. dollars and 3% to 5% in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be somewhere between $0.62 and $0.66 in U.S. dollars, $0.61 and $0.65 in constant currency. GAAP EPS is expected to be somewhere between $0.49 and $0.53 in U.S. dollars and $0.48 to $0.52 in constant currency. Now this guidance assumes a GAAP tax rate of 22% and a non-GAAP tax rate of 23.5%. Of course, it may end up being different. \r\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Larry.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Lawrence Ellison (Executives)】\nThank you, Safra. Okay. Oracle is focused, focused like a laser on one goal over the next few years, becoming the #1 company in cloud computing's 2 most profitable segments: Software as a Service, SaaS; and Platform as a Service, PaaS. \r\nWe expect to become #1 for 3 reasons: first, we have the most complete and modern portfolio of SaaS products in the cloud: CRM sales, CRM service, marketing. In Human Capital Management, we have core human resources: recruiting, talent management and payroll. In ERP, we have accounting, procurement, supply chain, project management and more, the most comprehensive suite of products in the cloud by far. \r\nSecond, all of those SaaS applications run on the world's most powerful platform in the cloud, the Oracle in-memory multitenant database and the world's most popular programming language, Java.\r\nThird, we have dramatically expanded, specialized and lined up our sales forces to sell SaaS and PaaS subscriptions against the new generation of cloud software competitors, and it's working. As we enter our new fiscal year, we're already #2 in overall SaaS subscription sales. In FY '15, our plan is to grow our SaaS bookings over 50%.\r\nThat will allow us to close in on the #1 spot. We already have a huge lead over Workday in cloud ERP. We acquired 120 new cloud ERP customers in Q4 alone. In HCM, we are dominating Workday in Europe and beating them in dozens of core HCM deals here in North America. Mark will give you some of the details and highlights regarding our cloud wins and our great Q4 quarter in the cloud. Mark?\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Mark Hurd (Executives)】\nThanks, Larry. Let me just actually start with hardware a little bit. We're now roughly in the middle of transitioning our hardware business. Engineered Systems were our strategy and now a significant part of our hardware. We've grown hardware for the second quarter in a row. \r\nThe change in mix away from commodity hardware to high-value Engineered Systems have transformed the business to an integrated Engineered Systems business that brings with it extremely attractive annuity. \r\nLet me give you some facts about hardware. Engineered Systems grew to record levels in Q4, while our competitors, as Safra described, are declining. We will ship our 10,000th Engineered System in Q1. We're at scale. Our hardware support margins are now approaching 70%, and this business is sticky. SPARC SuperCluster bookings grew triple-digits. Exalytics, Big Data Appliance and Oracle Database Appliance all grew double-digits. Oracle has become the hardware company, taking share, growing and doing it profitably. And as I said, we're in the middle of the transition. \r\nNow I'll talk about cloud. We're actually just starting this transition. We're the only company that has a whole suite of cloud applications. We're salesforce.com's primary competitor, Workday's primary competitor. And in a cloud, we're many times the size of Workday. We're bigger than SAP, and we're going to pass salesforce in the cloud. \r\nLet me run a few facts about you -- about our cloud. As industry analysts build their waves and quadrants, they need cloud leaders in specific cloud areas, and Oracle today is the leader across more cloud solutions than salesforce, Workday and SAP combined. Cloud bookings grew 37% last year. Q4 was the best ever for bookings. \r\nFusion cloud bookings growth were 3x the overall growth rate. Fusion HCM, ERP and Salesforce Automation revenue all grew triple-digits. We added 870 cloud customers in Q4, including in HCM nearly 320 customers, with Fusion 110 HCM customers. If I take Workday's reported number of 75 new customers, we're adding customers at 4 to 5x the pace of Workday. In Customer Experience, we added 430 customers, with 120-plus Fusion Salesforce Automation wins. \r\nWith BlueKai now on board, along with Eloqua and Responsys, we're the clear #1 in marketing automation, with bookings growth of 200% this quarter. In Salesforce Automation, bookings grew more than 80%, and revenue was up triple-digits. As Larry referenced, we added 120 ERP cloud customers in the quarter, all Fusion. In just Q4, we added more ERP cloud customers than Workday's total customer base for financials. More than 70 customer go lives just this quarter, with hundreds already live. \r\nWe're about to deliver release 9 of Fusion this summer. With Fusion, we have built the most attractive cloud solution in the industry. We've acquired the most attractive SaaS companies in the industry. We're already #1 or #2 in every SaaS category, and we won't stop until we're #1 in every category. \r\nJust like hardware, where we focused on Engineered Systems, in software, we are focused on the cloud. We're executing, we're winning and we're going to be #1. \r\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over for questions.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Ken Bond (Executives)】\nBefore we go to questions, Chelsea, I want to call out that we understand that some of you may have difficulty hearing parts of Mark's comments. So we'll continue to move forward with the call, and we will try to address some of Mark's comments into the Q&A. Chelsea, if you could start the Q&A, please?",
      "transcript_text3": "Safra, just on the revenue recognition changes, I'm just curious if you could just walk through why now. And I think you stated in the press release that you're seeing a shift of ratable revenue recognition versus upfront. And if you could maybe just talk through how long do you think that will take to accelerate the sales process to align to this new model.\n\n---\n\nOkay. So thanks for the question. Let me clarify my quote. Really, we have -- we always, always recognize SaaS and PaaS cloud subscriptions over time. That's always been the way we do it. New licenses we recognize upfront. We haven't changed any of our actual accounting. What's happened is that more of our software revenues are coming in as SaaS subscription, which we recognize over time, versus new license deals, which we recognize upfront. So we haven't actually changed any of our accounting. It's just that with our focus on cloud and the fact that we're selling more cloud, we recognize that ratably over time as appropriate on that contract. And so a bigger piece of software and what we used to call Software and Cloud subscription -- software -- new software license and cloud subscription, a larger piece of it is recognized over time. Did I -- did you understand me or should I try that again?\n\n---\n\nNo, that's great. And I guess just from a go-to-market from maybe Mark, just that process of putting that in place, how long does that take to get the sales aligned to that process?\n\n---\n\nWell, as Safra was recognizing -- can you hear me okay now? I just want to make sure -- I have a different microphone. But when you hire a salesperson who's selling cloud, they're really selling ARR, which is annual recurring revenue. Roughly speaking, ARR is 1/3 of a license. It's not precisely right. It differs a little bit by solution, but it's roughly right. So therefore, it would take roughly 3 years for somebody to get to the same productivity of what you would think of in the license model. So that's probably the time frame you should be thinking of. And as Larry...\n\n---\n\nOkay. Let me be -- there are 2 things. There is the rate in which -- this is Larry. The way in which -- rate at which we recognize revenue, which, of course, statutorily, whenever we sell a cloud subscription, whether it's Platform as a Service, Software as a Service, Infrastructure as a Service, you always recognize the revenue ratably by month versus selling a license, you recognize it upfront. That's the accounting. The sales force is motivated by their commissions, and we've made it commission-neutral. In other words, the sales force doesn't really care if they sell a license or if they sell a subscription. They get paid the same amount in either case. So the sales force has -- there's no time at all required for the sales force to transition to this new model. They get paid equally for a cloud subscription or a license. So there's no transition time, 0. What is different and what Safra was explaining is that as our cloud business gets bigger, and I think everybody wants our cloud business to get bigger, I certainly do, we actually make more money when we sell a cloud subscription. We break even where -- a subscription is probably after 3 years, as Mark pointed out. We get about the same amount of money from a subscription after 3 years as we get from a license. But these subscriptions last 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20 years. So we make a lot more money on a subscription, but we recognize the money over time. So as we make the transition to selling more cloud software services as opposed to upfront licenses, we'll recognize the cloud revenue over time. And that eventually -- that cloud revenue eventually will grow to be even bigger than our license revenue. At least that's our plan. And we'll make more money doing that over time. But during the transition to selling those cloud subscriptions, what would have been a license is now recognized over time. So we're going to recognize the revenue more slowly, and that will somewhat affect the top line during the transition. That's okay because in the long term, we make much, much more money. And we can effectively compete against this whole new array of competitors like salesforce and Workday versus the previous generation of competitors like SAP and IBM.\n\n---\n\nThis question is for Safra. Safra, you were able to keep the operating margins flat at about 47% despite, among other things, a big 10% growth in sales and marketing in fiscal '14. I just wanted to ask you, as you look forward to fiscal '15, do you think that pace of sales investments is likely to moderate? And how comfortable are you with Oracle returning to year-over-year margin improvement in this fiscal '15?\n\n---\n\nWell, I actually expect us to continue to improve over time, to be honest with you. The one thing that could maybe impact our margins negatively is if we are, like, outrageously successful with cloud in the next year or so, such that a lot of revenue comes in as cloud even though I don't recognize it upfront. And so we have expenses -- some expenses related to that, that are not matched by our other improvements in productivity in the rest of the business. Generally, I think we've got it very, very well balanced, and I actually expect our operating margins to improve because we've made the big investments in the field already. In most regions, the big, big investments have gone in over the past 3 years, and I don't expect them to continue to increase at that rate. Mark, Larry, you want to comment on...\n\n---\n\nNo, I think what Safra said is right. We have gone through a sizable buildup based on the strategy that we've described to you previously. We are still adding. We're not adding at the pace that we were adding. So I think you should expect us -- Larry talked about a pretty exciting opportunity for us in PaaS. We'll add sales people in the area of PaaS, and there'll be some complementary areas to the sales force that we've got. But you won't see the size of increases that you've seen over the past 2 to 3 years.\n\n---\n\nAnd they should be outweighed by revenue growth, as well as profitability improvements in the rest of business.\n\n---\n\nIt is a reasonable point to bring up, because it sort of relates to that first question that came up, that as our sales force now becomes more productive, particularly when you see cloud bookings, Larry gave you a very important statement about some thoughts about cloud bookings in 2015. As those numbers turn from bookings into revenue, that turns into a very attractive model, as it relates to your first question about our operating margins.\n\n---\n\nSafra, I'm wondering if you could talk about -- you gave guidance for license 3 months ago, and you were towards the low end of that. I'm wondering if you could help people understand what the source of the deviation was there. You did talk about you've seen more demand show up in SaaS. Was the total sort of volume and demand you saw from the software perspective SaaS and traditional on-prem license in line with what you were expecting at the midpoint or was it at the low end? Just trying to calibrate versus what you guided given all the moving pieces.\n\n---\n\nI think we're doing better in cloud than we expected. That has become extremely, extremely popular, and as a result, we have less of a growth in new license. We have a lot more in cloud, but obviously, I'm not recognizing all that cloud upfront. In fact, some of it, especially stuff that's actually booked in Q4, is not recognized at all. And so it shows up later, as you'll see, where I'm projecting cloud growth in the high-20s to 30s in my guidance, which is obviously a reflection of what's been going on. Cloud is doing extremely, extremely well. And sometimes to the extent, the customer's alternative, of course, would have been to buy a license. And so that's what's doing it. I'm actually thrilled that we are where we are in new license considering how much cloud growth we've got.\n\n---\n\nOne observation and a question. The observation is you folks have done a remarkable job growing your earnings through this cloud transition and investing in the sales force, which is something that many large cap [ph] tech and many large cap [ph] software companies are not able to -- that speaks to the power of the model. But my observation was that, Safra, I think you mentioned application is up about 6% or so, which is commendable, especially given the cloud transition. But any commentary on the technology side of the equation. Did that come in -- how did that fare relative to your expectations? And how should we think about the 12c cycle? Is the best of the 12c cycle yet to come, especially with the multitenant option and the in-memory option? Just trying to get a gauge whether there was any transition issue involved in the quarter on the tech side.\n\n---\n\nActually, it's a good question. I'm going to let Mark and Larry talk about the new products and the database. But actually, what went down in this quarter was an incredibly difficult compare in technology over Q4 last year, actually. So I'm actually very satisfied with where we came out on the tech side, happy with the app side and overall extremely happy about what's going on in cloud for us. So do you want to talk about the new product?\n\n---\n\nYou remember the comparison, we did a huge deal. salesforce.com is entirely based on the Oracle Database and Oracle technology, and in Q4 last year, of course, they decided to standardize for the next 10 years -- well, actually, to be maybe more precise, the next 9 years on the Oracle Database, and we had a very large deal with salesforce.com, which created a bit of a difficult compare for us this year in the tech portion of our business.\n\n---\n\nBut we've got our new products. Larry just did a launch last week. Last week?\n\n---\n\nYes. And, Kash, in terms of, yes, 12c, the -- clearly, the 12c is brand new. We think the multitenant option and the in-memory option are very, very attractive, especially to the cloud companies. Most of the cloud companies are based on the Oracle Database. For example, this last Q4, we did a huge -- a big deal with SAP, where SuccessFactors is based entirely on Oracle. And so people are using the Oracle Database in the cloud. So we had a nice deal with them. We had a nice -- a year ago, a nice deal with salesforce.com, obviously, NetSuite-based. But virtually, everybody, with the exception of Workday, is based on the Oracle Database. And we think these 2 features, the in-memory feature and the multitenant feature, really will allow us to deliver, by far, the best database experience in the cloud, and that should drive our database sales for the next few years.\n\n---\n\nKash, just a little bit of color for you on the database number. First, database, to Larry's point, was a tough compare in the U.S., but in Europe, we grew double-digits. So we had very strong database growth in Europe and so it really was that one compare that Larry's described. Middleware had growth in the quarter as well, which was good to see. And of course, as Safra mentioned, our apps business sort of enjoys the benefit the other way, but 6% growth in apps. And just to give context, Kash, I want to emphasize what you said, we had 6% growth in apps license at the same time as we -- on-premise, at the same time as we had the bookings growth that I referenced, which was 37% for the year in cloud bookings. It becomes so, as Safra says, popular here. So we actually got both benefits in the quarter, so a strong apps quarter for us.\n\n---\n\nI actually have a couple of questions on just cloud and applications overall. Maybe first, Larry, which product areas are you seeing best traction, fastest growth? And then the second part maybe, Mark, can you maybe break down adoption by region? Because the U.S. looked like it was a little slower compared to EMEA, and I'm trying to figure out if that's a reflection of perhaps greater cloud growth or adoption in the U.S. relative to Europe in on-premise licensing.\n\n---\n\nI think we're recognized clearly as the leader in marketing, and of course, our marketing suite, Gartner, recognized as the leader in marketing in the cloud. We're the upper right-hand company, and we had great growth in marketing. And we're getting traction both in B2C and B2B in marketing and doing very, very well. HCM kind of across-the-board, we're doing extremely well from core HCM to recruiting and talent. We've just been very, very successful in HCM. It's early days in ERP. However, Q4 was a great ERP, Fusion ERP. And this is all -- by the way, this is all stuff that we built. This is all Fusion, took us 8, 9, 10 year, whatever you -- however you [ph] want -- it took us a long time to build our next generation of cloud products: Fusion ERP, Fusion HCM, Fusion CRM. It was a tough road. But we're beginning to get real serious traction, especially in North America, for ERP. Our HCM products are doing extremely well in North America, where we're head-to-head against Workday. And we're running the table in EMEA in HCM. We really are the dominant supplier in the cloud in EMEA. In terms of the adoption rates, I mean, obviously, they're much -- cloud is much slower to be adopted in Asia Pac. But I'll turn it over to Mark.\n\n---\n\nWell, listen, I think, Jason, a couple of points. One, HCM, I think we're doing really well. I mean, I know nobody loves it when I read off names, but to be very blunt, our wins in the quarter were significant. Just a couple, Cox Enterprises, Eaton, Fair Isaac, National Instruments, Vivendi, Xerox, Fairmont [ph] Hotel. I mean, these are just a few of the quality brands we took down in HCM alone. So we had a strong HCM quarter. We're actually going up actually against the strongest HCM compare last year that we'd seen, but it was very, very impressive. So I think we have a position in HCM, where we're battling out with Workday. We think we're winning a lot more than we're losing. And we're doing really well internationally, particularly in Europe, as Larry described. Marketing, we won Kaiser, Eaton, Lexmark, Panasonic, Thomson Reuters, Time Warner Cable, Tyco. I mean, these are quality names that have adopted the Oracle Marketing Cloud. And I could go on across all these areas. So as I described in my prepared comments that maybe you couldn't hear, when you look at these Gartner Waves -- or Gartner Quadrants, sorry, and Forrester Waves, we lead in more of these waves and quadrants than our 3 cloud competitors combined. So I really feel very good about where we are. Now to your question about regions, I think you're taking the wrong conclusion out of Europe versus the United States. Our U.S. cloud business has done very well. You don't see it reflected in the numbers quite as well because of the conversation we had a couple of questions ago about the recognition of subscription revenue, but the bookings in the United States are quite strong. Our relative position in Europe may be stronger, but the adoption is slower relative to what we've seen in the U.S. Europe has done fantastic. Let me take nothing away from Europe. But what you've really seen them [ph] done a great job of is winning what's available in the European market, and they've done a great job in our traditional business at the same time.\n\n---\n\nJust want to follow up on the 12c. Larry, would you envision with the capabilities of 12c that your SaaS partners that use Oracle will rearchitect their products to support multitenancy at the database level and take advantage of in-memory capabilities as well to advance the apps offered on top of 12c?\n\n---\n\nWell, if you've already put multitenancy -- let me start with your rearchitecture your question. What the 12c database does, the multitenant feature, it takes an existing application that doesn't have multitenancy and builds into it at the application layer and makes those existing applications all multitenant. So there are a lot of companies that want to get to the cloud. I mean, I'm just going to pick one out of thin air like Cerner, who really don't have multitenant product but would like to get to the cloud. They'd be a perfect example of a company who runs on top of Oracle that would like to get to the cloud, where the Oracle Multitenant database gives them a fast-track to the cloud and fast-track of very fast Big Data Analytics with our in-memory option. So those 2 things are, I think, are going to be instrumental to us moving our huge ISV community to the cloud on top of our platform. We think that's a gigantic opportunity. And let me emphasize, our -- salesforce has really 2 businesses. salesforce.com, the leader in the cloud, has 2 businesses. They've got their Salesforce Automation business, which is most of their application business, and then they've got what they now call Salesforce1, which is their platform business. Our platform business is made up of the Oracle Database, which multitenants, in-memory, and the world's most popular programming language, Java. We have -- virtually every ISV runs on top of the Oracle Database. Virtually all of these companies would like to be able to move their offerings to the cloud. We now enable that. Our platform is just coming out this fall. This is a net new business for us going forward, moving all these ISVs into the cloud. We think this might be the biggest single -- in an opportunity-rich world as we are seeing our SaaS applications excel -- the growth is accelerating, by the way. We're growing much faster. So this year, 50% bookings, I mentioned it before. We're seeing the demand for our SaaS applications accelerate, absolutely. And having a broad portfolio gives us a lot of room to grow. PaaS is this new opportunity where a bunch of companies are just chomping at the bit to get their businesses to the cloud. We can move that ISV community to cloud with 12c. We think that's a gigantic opportunity, and it's going to help us grow our SaaS, PaaS business and make us #1 in both categories.\n\n---\n\nIs the in-memory piece as important as the multitenancy?\n\n---\n\nWell, it's different pieces, right? I mean, the multitenancy piece basically lets you get to the cloud, period, as -- with multitenancy. And the in-memory piece allows you to offer Big Data Analytics. And what you're asking me, which is more important, Big Data analytics or being -- multitenancy in the cloud, I think they're both crucial to modern computing. These are 2 of the biggest parts of modern computing. People spend a lot of time talking about cloud and getting to the cloud, getting your business to the cloud, modernizing it and Big Data Analytics. I mean, they're #1 and #2 in the conversation about technology these days in all the meetings I'm in.\n\n---\n\nAs Oracle continues with its success in the cloud, over time -- I know you mentioned the revenue benefits over time, but I'm wondering how we think about the long-term operating margin profile of the company as you guys continue down the path of your success. And then also just a follow-up for Mark, knowing you had a tough comp in the U.S. with the salesforce.com deal in the Americas, was there anything else impacting growth in the region in the quarter? And on the flip side, you had one of the best growth rates we've seen out of you guys in EMEA in quite some time. Is there anything there that you can highlight?\n\n---\n\nWhy don't you take the question first?\n\n---\n\nOkay. On the U.S., no, everything's roughly behaved as we expected. That's the issue on the comp. Europe, I've said this, I know, multiple times on these calls, they've just executed marvelously. They've taken enormous amounts of market share. They have just done a great job. And it's across, Heather, really all aspects of our business. It's across our Engineered Systems business, our database business, our Middleware business, our SaaS business. They were the first to add sales capacity. They added sales capacity, really, 3.5 years ago, and they've trained and assimilated that capacity. And that capacity has now got us in materially more deals. Simultaneously, we've been able to take some very strategic transactions, as we did this quarter, that are just part of that overall series of successes we've seen out of Europe. And I think, as you know, Europe hasn't been the most robust economy over the course of that time frame. So I think our team there has just executed marvelously.\n\n---\n\nHeather, on your margin question, as you can see in the numbers, and they basically speak for themselves, we've been doing this buildup and investment all within our profitability envelope. You can look at our cash flow statement, you can see our capital investment. We are incredibly advantaged because we make virtually absolutely everything in the cloud that we need, whether it's the hardware, Engineered Systems, the software, the operating system, the database. We have it all. And we have a business that is at such scale that we have enormous economies of scale. We can add customers at an extremely high profitability level because we have so many customers generally and, additionally, because we control literally so much of our own supply chain. So we can deliver these services, and we already have the sales force. We have everything in place. And we're not even at scale in cloud, so imagine at scale what's going to happen here. And as these new bookings, which are in a -- in this heavy growth period, actually start to rain back as revenue, we are extremely optimistic about our ability to grow cloud. And over time, as I said in my prepared remarks, in the short term, less revenue come in, in the long term and medium term, more revenue come in. And simultaneously, our customers spend and save an enormous amount of money themselves. So it's really a win-win as well for both of us.\n\n---\n\nLet me just add one little piece, which is the 2 parts of the cloud business that we're focused on are SaaS, the applications; and PaaS, the platform database and Java programming language. We think inherently, those businesses are 40%, 50% margin businesses. We think that's not the case in Infrastructure as a Service business. We think that's a lower margin business. But we think we can run it profitably in association with our SaaS and PaaS businesses. But where we're really trying to grow the business, where we're determined to be #1, is in SaaS and PaaS. We're in Infrastructure as a Service as a convenience to our customers who want to go -- have one-stop shopping and buy their applications platform and infrastructure at the same place. But we think collectively, those 3 businesses, as Safra said, we are our supply chain. So we buy electricity and buildings. Everything else we make. And we think we can deliver these cloud services without compromising our margins whatsoever.\n\n---\n\nMark, I might have missed this, but I just wanted to get some more color on the integrated systems. It looked like the business was a little bit weaker than we would have expected, and I would love to get some color around that. And I might have missed it on your opening comments.\n\n---\n\nYou mean Engineered Systems, correct, Joel?\n\n---\n\nEngineered Systems. Sorry, Mark.\n\n---\n\nYes. Strong quarter, best quarter we've ever had. So just to be clear, I think I said this in Q3, that Q3 was the best quarter we'd ever had, except for this Q4 that we're going to have that we had, and we beat it in Q4. Now in Q4 was that same deal that Larry described earlier as a comparison. And as Safra mentioned, I think she said in her remarks, but I'll say it if she didn't, we had double-digit growth in Engineered Systems in the quarter, so it was a record for us and very strong. We couldn't grow hardware the way we did without Engineered Systems having a strong quarter, so we're awful excited about that.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Thank you, operator. Our apologies for the technical difficulty this afternoon. We understand that the webcast came through cleanly, so a telephonic replay of the conference call will be available shortly. Dial-in information for that webcast replay can be found in the press release issued earlier today. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call.

      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Brent Thill (Analysts)】\nSafra, just on the revenue recognition changes, I'm just curious if you could just walk through why now. And I think you stated in the press release that you're seeing a shift of ratable revenue recognition versus upfront. And if you could maybe just talk through how long do you think that will take to accelerate the sales process to align to this new model.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Safra Catz (Executives)】\nOkay. So thanks for the question. Let me clarify my quote. Really, we have -- we always, always recognize SaaS and PaaS cloud subscriptions over time. That's always been the way we do it. New licenses we recognize upfront. We haven't changed any of our actual accounting. What's happened is that more of our software revenues are coming in as SaaS subscription, which we recognize over time, versus new license deals, which we recognize upfront. So we haven't actually changed any of our accounting. It's just that with our focus on cloud and the fact that we're selling more cloud, we recognize that ratably over time as appropriate on that contract. And so a bigger piece of software and what we used to call Software and Cloud subscription -- software -- new software license and cloud subscription, a larger piece of it is recognized over time. Did I -- did you understand me or should I try that again?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Brent Thill (Analysts)】\nNo, that's great. And I guess just from a go-to-market from maybe Mark, just that process of putting that in place, how long does that take to get the sales aligned to that process?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Hurd (Executives)】\nWell, as Safra was recognizing -- can you hear me okay now? I just want to make sure -- I have a different microphone. But when you hire a salesperson who's selling cloud, they're really selling ARR, which is annual recurring revenue. Roughly speaking, ARR is 1/3 of a license. It's not precisely right. It differs a little bit by solution, but it's roughly right. So therefore, it would take roughly 3 years for somebody to get to the same productivity of what you would think of in the license model. So that's probably the time frame you should be thinking of. And as Larry...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Ellison (Executives)】\nOkay. Let me be -- there are 2 things. There is the rate in which -- this is Larry. The way in which -- rate at which we recognize revenue, which, of course, statutorily, whenever we sell a cloud subscription, whether it's Platform as a Service, Software as a Service, Infrastructure as a Service, you always recognize the revenue ratably by month versus selling a license, you recognize it upfront. That's the accounting. The sales force is motivated by their commissions, and we've made it commission-neutral. In other words, the sales force doesn't really care if they sell a license or if they sell a subscription. They get paid the same amount in either case. So the sales force has -- there's no time at all required for the sales force to transition to this new model. They get paid equally for a cloud subscription or a license. So there's no transition time, 0. What is different and what Safra was explaining is that as our cloud business gets bigger, and I think everybody wants our cloud business to get bigger, I certainly do, we actually make more money when we sell a cloud subscription. We break even where -- a subscription is probably after 3 years, as Mark pointed out. We get about the same amount of money from a subscription after 3 years as we get from a license. But these subscriptions last 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20 years. So we make a lot more money on a subscription, but we recognize the money over time. So as we make the transition to selling more cloud software services as opposed to upfront licenses, we'll recognize the cloud revenue over time. And that eventually -- that cloud revenue eventually will grow to be even bigger than our license revenue. At least that's our plan. And we'll make more money doing that over time. But during the transition to selling those cloud subscriptions, what would have been a license is now recognized over time. So we're going to recognize the revenue more slowly, and that will somewhat affect the top line during the transition. That's okay because in the long term, we make much, much more money. And we can effectively compete against this whole new array of competitors like salesforce and Workday versus the previous generation of competitors like SAP and IBM.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Karl Keirstead (Analysts)】\nThis question is for Safra. Safra, you were able to keep the operating margins flat at about 47% despite, among other things, a big 10% growth in sales and marketing in fiscal '14. I just wanted to ask you, as you look forward to fiscal '15, do you think that pace of sales investments is likely to moderate? And how comfortable are you with Oracle returning to year-over-year margin improvement in this fiscal '15?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Safra Catz (Executives)】\nWell, I actually expect us to continue to improve over time, to be honest with you. The one thing that could maybe impact our margins negatively is if we are, like, outrageously successful with cloud in the next year or so, such that a lot of revenue comes in as cloud even though I don't recognize it upfront. And so we have expenses -- some expenses related to that, that are not matched by our other improvements in productivity in the rest of the business. Generally, I think we've got it very, very well balanced, and I actually expect our operating margins to improve because we've made the big investments in the field already. In most regions, the big, big investments have gone in over the past 3 years, and I don't expect them to continue to increase at that rate. Mark, Larry, you want to comment on...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Hurd (Executives)】\nNo, I think what Safra said is right. We have gone through a sizable buildup based on the strategy that we've described to you previously. We are still adding. We're not adding at the pace that we were adding. So I think you should expect us -- Larry talked about a pretty exciting opportunity for us in PaaS. We'll add sales people in the area of PaaS, and there'll be some complementary areas to the sales force that we've got. But you won't see the size of increases that you've seen over the past 2 to 3 years.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Safra Catz (Executives)】\nAnd they should be outweighed by revenue growth, as well as profitability improvements in the rest of business.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Hurd (Executives)】\nIt is a reasonable point to bring up, because it sort of relates to that first question that came up, that as our sales force now becomes more productive, particularly when you see cloud bookings, Larry gave you a very important statement about some thoughts about cloud bookings in 2015. As those numbers turn from bookings into revenue, that turns into a very attractive model, as it relates to your first question about our operating margins.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Walter Pritchard (Analysts)】\nSafra, I'm wondering if you could talk about -- you gave guidance for license 3 months ago, and you were towards the low end of that. I'm wondering if you could help people understand what the source of the deviation was there. You did talk about you've seen more demand show up in SaaS. Was the total sort of volume and demand you saw from the software perspective SaaS and traditional on-prem license in line with what you were expecting at the midpoint or was it at the low end? Just trying to calibrate versus what you guided given all the moving pieces.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Safra Catz (Executives)】\nI think we're doing better in cloud than we expected. That has become extremely, extremely popular, and as a result, we have less of a growth in new license. We have a lot more in cloud, but obviously, I'm not recognizing all that cloud upfront. In fact, some of it, especially stuff that's actually booked in Q4, is not recognized at all. And so it shows up later, as you'll see, where I'm projecting cloud growth in the high-20s to 30s in my guidance, which is obviously a reflection of what's been going on. Cloud is doing extremely, extremely well. And sometimes to the extent, the customer's alternative, of course, would have been to buy a license. And so that's what's doing it. I'm actually thrilled that we are where we are in new license considering how much cloud growth we've got.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kash Rangan (Analysts)】\nOne observation and a question. The observation is you folks have done a remarkable job growing your earnings through this cloud transition and investing in the sales force, which is something that many large cap [ph] tech and many large cap [ph] software companies are not able to -- that speaks to the power of the model. But my observation was that, Safra, I think you mentioned application is up about 6% or so, which is commendable, especially given the cloud transition. But any commentary on the technology side of the equation. Did that come in -- how did that fare relative to your expectations? And how should we think about the 12c cycle? Is the best of the 12c cycle yet to come, especially with the multitenant option and the in-memory option? Just trying to get a gauge whether there was any transition issue involved in the quarter on the tech side.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Safra Catz (Executives)】\nActually, it's a good question. I'm going to let Mark and Larry talk about the new products and the database. But actually, what went down in this quarter was an incredibly difficult compare in technology over Q4 last year, actually. So I'm actually very satisfied with where we came out on the tech side, happy with the app side and overall extremely happy about what's going on in cloud for us. So do you want to talk about the new product?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Ellison (Executives)】\nYou remember the comparison, we did a huge deal. salesforce.com is entirely based on the Oracle Database and Oracle technology, and in Q4 last year, of course, they decided to standardize for the next 10 years -- well, actually, to be maybe more precise, the next 9 years on the Oracle Database, and we had a very large deal with salesforce.com, which created a bit of a difficult compare for us this year in the tech portion of our business.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Safra Catz (Executives)】\nBut we've got our new products. Larry just did a launch last week. Last week?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Ellison (Executives)】\nYes. And, Kash, in terms of, yes, 12c, the -- clearly, the 12c is brand new. We think the multitenant option and the in-memory option are very, very attractive, especially to the cloud companies. Most of the cloud companies are based on the Oracle Database. For example, this last Q4, we did a huge -- a big deal with SAP, where SuccessFactors is based entirely on Oracle. And so people are using the Oracle Database in the cloud. So we had a nice deal with them. We had a nice -- a year ago, a nice deal with salesforce.com, obviously, NetSuite-based. But virtually, everybody, with the exception of Workday, is based on the Oracle Database. And we think these 2 features, the in-memory feature and the multitenant feature, really will allow us to deliver, by far, the best database experience in the cloud, and that should drive our database sales for the next few years.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Hurd (Executives)】\nKash, just a little bit of color for you on the database number. First, database, to Larry's point, was a tough compare in the U.S., but in Europe, we grew double-digits. So we had very strong database growth in Europe and so it really was that one compare that Larry's described. Middleware had growth in the quarter as well, which was good to see. And of course, as Safra mentioned, our apps business sort of enjoys the benefit the other way, but 6% growth in apps. And just to give context, Kash, I want to emphasize what you said, we had 6% growth in apps license at the same time as we -- on-premise, at the same time as we had the bookings growth that I referenced, which was 37% for the year in cloud bookings. It becomes so, as Safra says, popular here. So we actually got both benefits in the quarter, so a strong apps quarter for us.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jason Maynard (Analysts)】\nI actually have a couple of questions on just cloud and applications overall. Maybe first, Larry, which product areas are you seeing best traction, fastest growth? And then the second part maybe, Mark, can you maybe break down adoption by region? Because the U.S. looked like it was a little slower compared to EMEA, and I'm trying to figure out if that's a reflection of perhaps greater cloud growth or adoption in the U.S. relative to Europe in on-premise licensing.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Ellison (Executives)】\nI think we're recognized clearly as the leader in marketing, and of course, our marketing suite, Gartner, recognized as the leader in marketing in the cloud. We're the upper right-hand company, and we had great growth in marketing. And we're getting traction both in B2C and B2B in marketing and doing very, very well. HCM kind of across-the-board, we're doing extremely well from core HCM to recruiting and talent. We've just been very, very successful in HCM. It's early days in ERP. However, Q4 was a great ERP, Fusion ERP. And this is all -- by the way, this is all stuff that we built. This is all Fusion, took us 8, 9, 10 year, whatever you -- however you [ph] want -- it took us a long time to build our next generation of cloud products: Fusion ERP, Fusion HCM, Fusion CRM. It was a tough road. But we're beginning to get real serious traction, especially in North America, for ERP. Our HCM products are doing extremely well in North America, where we're head-to-head against Workday. And we're running the table in EMEA in HCM. We really are the dominant supplier in the cloud in EMEA. In terms of the adoption rates, I mean, obviously, they're much -- cloud is much slower to be adopted in Asia Pac. But I'll turn it over to Mark.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Hurd (Executives)】\nWell, listen, I think, Jason, a couple of points. One, HCM, I think we're doing really well. I mean, I know nobody loves it when I read off names, but to be very blunt, our wins in the quarter were significant. Just a couple, Cox Enterprises, Eaton, Fair Isaac, National Instruments, Vivendi, Xerox, Fairmont [ph] Hotel. I mean, these are just a few of the quality brands we took down in HCM alone. So we had a strong HCM quarter. We're actually going up actually against the strongest HCM compare last year that we'd seen, but it was very, very impressive. So I think we have a position in HCM, where we're battling out with Workday. We think we're winning a lot more than we're losing. And we're doing really well internationally, particularly in Europe, as Larry described. Marketing, we won Kaiser, Eaton, Lexmark, Panasonic, Thomson Reuters, Time Warner Cable, Tyco. I mean, these are quality names that have adopted the Oracle Marketing Cloud. And I could go on across all these areas. So as I described in my prepared comments that maybe you couldn't hear, when you look at these Gartner Waves -- or Gartner Quadrants, sorry, and Forrester Waves, we lead in more of these waves and quadrants than our 3 cloud competitors combined. So I really feel very good about where we are. Now to your question about regions, I think you're taking the wrong conclusion out of Europe versus the United States. Our U.S. cloud business has done very well. You don't see it reflected in the numbers quite as well because of the conversation we had a couple of questions ago about the recognition of subscription revenue, but the bookings in the United States are quite strong. Our relative position in Europe may be stronger, but the adoption is slower relative to what we've seen in the U.S. Europe has done fantastic. Let me take nothing away from Europe. But what you've really seen them [ph] done a great job of is winning what's available in the European market, and they've done a great job in our traditional business at the same time.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Richard Sherlund (Analysts)】\nJust want to follow up on the 12c. Larry, would you envision with the capabilities of 12c that your SaaS partners that use Oracle will rearchitect their products to support multitenancy at the database level and take advantage of in-memory capabilities as well to advance the apps offered on top of 12c?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Ellison (Executives)】\nWell, if you've already put multitenancy -- let me start with your rearchitecture your question. What the 12c database does, the multitenant feature, it takes an existing application that doesn't have multitenancy and builds into it at the application layer and makes those existing applications all multitenant. So there are a lot of companies that want to get to the cloud. I mean, I'm just going to pick one out of thin air like Cerner, who really don't have multitenant product but would like to get to the cloud. They'd be a perfect example of a company who runs on top of Oracle that would like to get to the cloud, where the Oracle Multitenant database gives them a fast-track to the cloud and fast-track of very fast Big Data Analytics with our in-memory option. So those 2 things are, I think, are going to be instrumental to us moving our huge ISV community to the cloud on top of our platform. We think that's a gigantic opportunity. And let me emphasize, our -- salesforce has really 2 businesses. salesforce.com, the leader in the cloud, has 2 businesses. They've got their Salesforce Automation business, which is most of their application business, and then they've got what they now call Salesforce1, which is their platform business. Our platform business is made up of the Oracle Database, which multitenants, in-memory, and the world's most popular programming language, Java. We have -- virtually every ISV runs on top of the Oracle Database. Virtually all of these companies would like to be able to move their offerings to the cloud. We now enable that. Our platform is just coming out this fall. This is a net new business for us going forward, moving all these ISVs into the cloud. We think this might be the biggest single -- in an opportunity-rich world as we are seeing our SaaS applications excel -- the growth is accelerating, by the way. We're growing much faster. So this year, 50% bookings, I mentioned it before. We're seeing the demand for our SaaS applications accelerate, absolutely. And having a broad portfolio gives us a lot of room to grow. PaaS is this new opportunity where a bunch of companies are just chomping at the bit to get their businesses to the cloud. We can move that ISV community to cloud with 12c. We think that's a gigantic opportunity, and it's going to help us grow our SaaS, PaaS business and make us #1 in both categories.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Richard Sherlund (Analysts)】\nIs the in-memory piece as important as the multitenancy?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Ellison (Executives)】\nWell, it's different pieces, right? I mean, the multitenancy piece basically lets you get to the cloud, period, as -- with multitenancy. And the in-memory piece allows you to offer Big Data Analytics.

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you, Jackie, and good morning, everyone. We welcome you to our first quarter conference call. On the call with me are John Standley, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ken Martindale, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Frank Vitrano, our Chief Financial and Chief Administrative Officer. \r\nOn today's call, John will give an overview of our first quarter results and discuss our business, Ken will give an update on some of our key initiatives, Frank will discuss the key financial highlights and fiscal 2015 outlook, and then we will take questions. \r\nAs we mentioned in our release, we are providing slides related to the material we will be discussing today. These slides include annual earnings and sales guidance. These slides are provided on our website, www.riteaid.com, under the Investor Relations information tab for conference calls. This guidance is a point-in-time estimate and the company expressly disclaims any current intention to update it. This conference call and the related slides will be available on the company's website until the next earnings call, unless the company withdraws them earlier, and should not be relied upon thereafter. We will not be referring to the slides directly in our remarks, but hope you will find them helpful as they summarize some of the key points made on the call. \r\nBefore we start, I'd like to remind you that today's conference call includes certain forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are made in the context of certain risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to differ. These risks and uncertainties are described in our press release, in Item 1A of our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and other documents we file or furnish to the Securities and Exchange Commission. \r\nAlso, we will be using a non-GAAP financial measure. The definition of the non-GAAP financial measure, along with the reconciliations to the related GAAP measure, are described in our press release. \r\nAlso included in our slides are the non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted EBITDA gross profit and adjusted EBITDA SG&A, and the reconciliations of those measures to their respective GAAP financial measure. \r\nWith these remarks, I'd now like to turn it over to John.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Matt, and thank you all for joining us to review our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2015. \r\nOur store operating performance for the quarter was strong, though results for net income and adjusted EBITDA trailed our expectations. We delivered our seventh consecutive quarter of profitability by generating $41.4 million in net income compared to $89.7 million during last year's first quarter. \r\nA decrease in adjusted EBITDA and higher income tax expense contributed to this result, and these factors were partially offset by lower interest expense and a lower LIFO charge. \r\nAdjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $282.6 million as compared to $344.8 million during the prior year period. This result was driven by a reduction in pharmacy gross profit due to lower reimbursement rates that were not offset with reductions in generic drug costs. \r\nWe also had higher salary and payroll-related expenses as we continue to make investments in our business. As announced in February, we are transitioning to a new drug sourcing and distribution process through our expanded partnership with McKesson. This new process is expected to deliver long-term drug cost savings, and will provide our pharmacies with direct-to-store delivery 5 days a week, which will provide significant working capital benefits. \r\nAs we transition to our new purchasing model, we expect lower pharmacy gross margin during the transition period because we are unable to negotiate lower drug costs, as we normally would do, to offset reimbursement rate pressure in generic drug cost increases. \r\nThis increased vulnerability to reimbursement rate changes and generic drug cost increases will continue during a portion of the second quarter as we complete the transition. \r\nA significant portion of the change we made to our fiscal 2015 guidance on June 5 reflects that the negative gross margin impact of this transition was greater than we anticipated because reimbursement rate pressures were more significant than we expected, and the timing of savings realized from the McKesson agreement is slower than our original estimates. \r\nAlthough this transition is longer than we expected, this new sourcing and distribution model is a groundbreaking opportunity for us. And as we work through this transition, I'm confident this is the right strategic step to drive our long-term success. We're really excited about how this partnership will allow us to achieve supply chain efficiencies, provide even better service to our customers and generate additional cash flow to fuel our long-term growth. \r\nAs I mentioned earlier, we delivered a strong store operating performance during the quarter, including solid revenue growth and positive comps for same-store sales and prescription counts. \r\nWe also held the line on front-end same-store sales, which were flat for the quarter, as we strike a balance between maintaining front-end margins and remaining competitive in a highly promotional environment. \r\nIn terms of our script count, there are indications that the Affordable Care Act is beginning to have a positive impact, as we are experiencing growth in states that have expanded Medicaid. \r\nIn addition, we are seeing higher utilization among our patients. \r\nWe continue to make significant progress with our key initiatives as we transition our strategy to more aggressively pursuing opportunities for long-term growth. \r\nIn a few moments, Ken will talk about -- more about our Wellness Store program and the continued success of our remodeling efforts. \r\nFrom a strategic standpoint, it's important to note that our Wellness Stores will serve as a primary vehicle for launching innovative merchandising solutions, expanded health care offerings, and over the next few years, our relocation and new store program. \r\nNext week, we will hold the groundbreaking -- the ground -- the grand reopening of a Wellness Store on North Canon Drive in Beverly Hills that illustrates how we're aggressively evolving the format to identify additional features that can be broadly applied to future remodels and other features that can be implemented in select stores with specific growth opportunities. \r\nWellness Stores will also serve as the foundation for expanding our health care offering, including our Rite Aid Health Alliance program for patients with chronic and polychronic conditions, as well as adding RediClinics to Rite Aid stores. \r\nWe recently expanded our Health Alliance pilot by announcing a new partnership with Penn State Hershey Health System in Hershey, Pennsylvania. We are encouraged by the initial result of our pilots, which are now active in 4 markets. \r\nWe continue to focus on forming partnerships with additional medical practices as we look to provide a higher level of care and support patients with chronic and polychronic conditions. \r\nIn addition, the integration of Health Dialog into the Rite Aid family has been smooth thus far, and this new subsidiary is providing the in-store care coaches to support the Health Alliance program in these new markets. \r\nWe're also making strong progress as we integrate RediClinic into our operating structure. We are now actively engaged in site selection for adding our first RediClinics to Rite Aid stores. \r\nAt this time, I'd like to turn it over to our President and Chief Operating Officer, Ken Martindale, who has additional information regarding our key initiatives. Ken?\n\n---\n\nThanks, John, and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call this morning. \r\nAs John said, we continue to make significant progress with the key initiatives that will fuel our transition into becoming a growing retail health care company. \r\nOur Wellness Store program is a foundational element of this strategy as we continue our remodeling efforts and build up our real estate pipeline for relocations and new stores. \r\nWe now have completed 1,325 Wellness remodels, which represents 29% of all Rite Aid locations. These stores continue to outperform the rest of the chain in terms of same-store front-end sales and script count, and we continue to push the envelope in leveraging these stores to launch and expand innovative merchandising solutions. \r\nA great example is the Beverly Hills store that John mentioned earlier. It includes concepts that have performed well in pilot and will be broadly applied to future Wellness Stores, like our enhanced OTC presentation that features educational materials, interactive product displays and creative fixturing. \r\nThe store also features concepts that we're just beginning to test, such as our Fresh Day Café that serves coffee, pastries, breakfast sandwiches and Rite Aid's very own Thrifty Ice Cream. \r\nAnd finally, this store includes an expanded and enhanced beauty department, staffed by a terrific beauty advisor. \r\nThis project is a great example of the ongoing evolution of our Wellness format. We are striving to continually apply innovative merchandising, increased education and personalized service to drive a more engaging consumer experience. \r\nAt the same time, we continue to align our front-end offering to further support our expanded health care offering. We are currently working to further strengthen our smoking cessation program by developing a best-in-class consumer solution. \r\nWe have also launched a nutritional labeling system to help shoppers easily find food items that are a better fit for their wellness needs. \r\nOur highly successful immunization program continues to be a point of emphasis throughout our company. Our store, clinical and field supervision teams are already actively engaging with organizations in their local communities to secure additional flu shot clinics for the upcoming season. \r\nWe've also ramped up our efforts to raise awareness about our full complement of other immunizations to further promote Rite Aid as a destination to meet all of our patients' immunization needs. \r\nOur wellness65+ loyalty program for seniors is gaining additional traction as well. Membership in the program is approaching 2 million, and our wellness65+ Wednesday events continue to give seniors a compelling reason to visit their local Rite Aid and explore the vast offering of Wellness benefits available to them. \r\nIn addition, the broader wellness+ loyalty program continues to perform as well as -- and customers respond positively to the program's unique combination of exclusive savings and wellness benefits. \r\nAs we look to further engage our 25 million active members, our customer relationship management program continues to gain momentum in strengthening loyalty among our best customers by using individualized targeted offers. \r\nWe are in the process of expanding these efforts to social, mobile and other digital channels and expect our broader CRM program to serve as the foundation for future growth at Rite Aid. \r\nCustomers continue to respond positively to the value delivered by our private brand items, with private brand penetration increasing 31 basis points over the prior year to nearly 18% during the first quarter. \r\nOur ongoing prescription file buy initiative remains very active and continues to produce strong results. \r\nDuring the quarter, we completed $19.6 million in file buys, and we're on pace to achieve our goal of $90 million for the fiscal year. \r\nAs we more aggressively pursue opportunities for growth, we are prepared to increase our allocation for file buys if additional opportunities arise throughout the fiscal year. \r\nTo sum it up, we are pleased with the progress of our key wellness and growth initiatives, and look forward to further strengthening these programs while delivering on our promise to actively work with our customers to keep them well. \r\nAt this time, I will turn it over to our Chief Financial & Administrative Officer, Frank Vitrano, who will provide additional details about our financial results. Frank?\n\n---\n\nThanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone. First quarter results reflect pharmacy product cost and reimbursement rate challenges despite strengthening script count and front-end trends, as well as continued progress from our various initiatives. \r\nOn the call this morning, I plan to walk through our first quarter financial results, discuss our liquidity position, certain balance sheet items, our capital expenditure plan and finally, review of our fiscal '15 annual guidance. \r\nRevenue for the quarter was $6.5 billion, which was $172 million or 2.7% higher than last year's first quarter. The increase was due to higher pharmacy sales. \r\nOverall, same-store sales increased 3.1% in the quarter, reflecting higher pharmacy script count and inflation rate. \r\nFront-end same-store sales were flat compared to last year. Pharmacy same-store sales were higher by 4.6%, which had included an approximate 143-basis-point negative impact from new generic drugs compared to a 450-basis-point negative impact from new generic drugs in the prior year's first quarter. \r\nPharmacy same-store comp scripts were up 230 basis points, reflecting higher utilization, particularly in Medicaid expansion states. \r\nAdjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $282.6 million or 4.4% of revenues, which was $62 million -- $62.2 million lower than last year's first quarter of $344.8 million or 5.5% of revenues. The current quarter's results were primarily driven by lower pharmacy gross profit due to lower reimbursement rates that we were unable to offset with the reductions in generic costs, as well as higher SG&A. \r\nNet income for the quarter was $41.4 million or $0.04 per diluted share, compared to last year's first quarter net income of $89.7 million or $0.09 per diluted share. \r\nDecline was driven by the $62.2 million decline in adjusted EBITDA and a higher income tax expense, partially offset by lower interest expense, LIFO and lease termination and impairment charges as compared to last year. \r\nIncome tax expense was recorded to maintain a full tax valuation allowance for the company's deferred tax assets. The increase was driven by higher stock-based compensation expense for tax purposes. The valuation allowance increase is a noncash item. \r\nRefinancings completed in March of this year and June of '13 drove the reduction in interest expense. The lower LIFO charge was driven by an expected decrease in inventory levels. \r\nTotal gross profit dollars in the quarter were $18 million lower than last year's first quarter and 105 basis points lower as a percent to revenues. \r\nAdjusted EBITDA gross profit, which excludes specific items, primarily LIFO and the wellness+ revenue deferral, was unfavorable to the prior year's first quarter by $28.7 million and lower by 123 basis points as a percent to revenues. \r\nPharmacy gross profit dollars and margin rate were lower. Pharmacy gross profit was impacted by continued reimbursement rate pressure that we were unable to offset with reductions in generic costs due to a delay in realizing the level of generic price reductions we expected from our purchasing arrangement. \r\nFront-end gross profit dollars and rate were flat to last year. These items were partially offset by the inclusion of Health Dialog and RediClinic revenues in this year's results. \r\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter were higher by $35.1 million and 14 basis points lower as a percent to revenues compared to last year. \r\nAdjusted EBITDA SG&A dollars, which excludes specific items, were higher by $33.4 million and 12 basis points lower as a percent to revenues compared to last year. \r\nThe increase was driven by $14.7 million in operating and deal cost related to the recent acquisition of Health Dialog and RediClinic. \r\nWages and benefit increases drove the balance of the increase, partially offset by our various expense control initiatives. \r\nFIFO inventory was lower than the first quarter of last year by $110 million, primarily driven by initiatives to better manage inventory levels. \r\nOur cash flow statement results for the quarter shows net cash from operating activities as the source of $239.7 million as compared to a source of $184.5 million in last year's first quarter, with lower inventory and timing differences in accounts payable driving the variance. \r\nNet cash used in investment activities for the quarter was $177.4 million versus $82.1 million last year. \r\nDuring the quarter, we remodeled 105 stores, expanded 1 store, relocated 3 stores and closed 7 stores. \r\nAt the end of the first quarter of fiscal '15, we have completed and grand reopened 1,325 Wellness Stores. \r\nIn the first quarter of fiscal '15, front-end same-store sales in the Wellness Stores exceeded the non-Wellness Stores by 265 basis points, and script growth in the Wellness Stores exceeded the non-Wellness Stores by 120 basis points. \r\nNow let's discuss liquidity. At the end of the first quarter, we had $1.368 billion of liquidity. Our liquidity has increased $226 million over last year. We had $351 million of borrowing outstanding under our $1.8 billion senior secured facility, with $88 million of outstanding letters of credit. \r\nTotal debt, net of invested cash, was lower by $208 million from last year's first quarter. Our leverage ratio, defined as total debt less invested cash over LTM adjusted EBITDA, improved to 4.5x from 4.9x as compared to the first quarter of fiscal '14. \r\nNow let's turn to fiscal '15 guidance, which was released on June 5 with our May sales results. We updated our guidance based upon a shortfall in the first quarter earnings, which was primarily driven by pharmacy margin trends, as discussed before, as well as an updated time line to achieve a lower gross -- to lower generic purchase price reductions from our purchasing arrangement. \r\nWe also adjusted for delays in the introduction of certain new generics, as well as the impact of January 1 plan changes. The guidance also reflects continued reimbursement rate pressure and more drug cost increases than normal. We have also updated our assumptions concerning AMP, as we now expect that it will not be implemented in fiscal '15. \r\nThe guidance includes incremental expense control initiatives to partially offset the pharmacy margin pressures. \r\nWe updated our LIFO provision for the year based upon the anticipated reduction in pharmacy inventory, both at the stores and DCs. Our guidance does include the anticipated benefit of our Wellness remodel program, customer loyalty program and other initiatives to grow sales and drive operating efficiencies. \r\nWe expect the current promotional environment to -- we expect the current competitive environment to remain promotional. We also considered planned wages and benefit increases. \r\nWe increased our expected working capital benefit to $250 million from $150 million as a result of the McKesson agreement. We are seeing early results reflecting lower store pharmacy inventory as a result of more frequent direct store deliveries. The previous guidance only included the distribution center inventory reductions, and working capital benefit will not be fully realized until the fourth quarter of fiscal '15. \r\nWe expect script growth benefits from ACA, favorable demographics, file buy acquisitions, growth in immunizations and other initiatives. \r\nAs was mentioned on the fiscal '14 earnings call in April, we expected the second half of fiscal '15 to be stronger than the first 2 quarters, due in part to the strength of fiscal '14's first half, as well as the introduction of new generics in the second half of fiscal '15. \r\nOur second quarter comparison to the comparable quarter last year will be impacted by the previously disclosed $23.5 million prescription drug antitrust settlement in last year's second quarter, as well as the timing in realizing the run rate benefits of the expanded partnership with McKesson. \r\nThe company expects sales to be between $26 billion and $26.5 billion, and expected adjusted EBITDA to be between $1.275 billion and $1.35 billion in fiscal '15. \r\nSame-store sales are expected to be in a range of an increase of 2.5% to 4.5%, including the anticipated negative pharmacy sales impact of approximately 240 basis points from new generic introductions and continued reimbursement rate pressure. \r\nWe expect a fiscal '15 earnings range of net income of $298 million or earnings per diluted share of $0.30 to net income of $408 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.40. \r\nThe range of guidance is primarily driven by our same-store sales range and pharmacy margin. \r\nOur guidance includes investments to integrate both RediClinic and Health Dialog, and we plan to open an additional 70 RediClinics over the next 18 months. \r\nFiscal 2015 capital expenditure plan is to spend $525 million, with $225 million allocated to remodels and $90 million to file buys. \r\nWe are planning to open 1 new store, complete 19 relocations and remodel 450 Wellness Stores in fiscal '15. \r\nWe expect free cash flow to be in a range of $400 million to $450 million for the year, including the benefit of lower pharmacy inventory and the acquisition of RediClinic and Health Dialog. \r\nWe expect to close a total of 40 stores, of which the guidance includes a store lease closing provision for '15, with the balance closing upon lease expiration. \r\nThe guidance also assumes that we will call and prepay our 10.25% second-lien notes due in 2019 sometime after the next call premium step-down in October. \r\nThat completes my portion of the presentation. I'd now like to turn it back to John.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Frank. Before we open the phone lines for questions, I'd just like to thank our dedicated associates for their commitment to executing our key initiatives and their contributions to our strong store operating performance during the first quarter. \r\nLooking ahead, we believe that our strategy to expand our health care offering is the right strategy to position Rite Aid for growth in this changing health care environment and delivering long-term value for our stakeholders. \r\nWe will continue to focus on further developing our existing programs, while aggressively pursuing new opportunities to deliver convenient, affordable and effective health care solutions to the communities we serve. \r\nThat concludes our prepared remarks for this morning. We will now open the phone lines for questions.",

On the call with me are John Standley, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ken Martindale, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Frank Vitrano, our Chief Financial and Chief Administrative Officer. \r\nOn today's call, John will give an overview of our first quarter results and discuss our business, Ken will give an update on some of our key initiatives, Frank will discuss the key financial highlights and fiscal 2015 outlook, and then we will take questions. \r\nAs we mentioned in our release, we are providing slides related to the material we will be discussing today. These slides include annual earnings and sales guidance. These slides are provided on our website, www.riteaid.com, under the Investor Relations information tab for conference calls. This guidance is a point-in-time estimate and the company expressly disclaims any current intention to update it. This conference call and the related slides will be available on the company's website until the next earnings call, unless the company withdraws them earlier, and should not be relied upon thereafter. We will not be referring to the slides directly in our remarks, but hope you will find them helpful as they summarize some of the key points made on the call. \r\nBefore we start, I'd like to remind you that today's conference call includes certain forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are made in the context of certain risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to differ. These risks and uncertainties are described in our press release, in Item 1A of our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and other documents we file or furnish to the Securities and Exchange Commission. \r\nAlso, we will be using a non-GAAP financial measure. The definition of the non-GAAP financial measure, along with the reconciliations to the related GAAP measure, are described in our press release. \r\nAlso included in our slides are the non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted EBITDA gross profit and adjusted EBITDA SG&A, and the reconciliations of those measures to their respective GAAP financial measure. \r\nWith these remarks, I'd now like to turn it over to John.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: John Standley (Executives)】\nThanks, Matt, and thank you all for joining us to review our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2015. \r\nOur store operating performance for the quarter was strong, though results for net income and adjusted EBITDA trailed our expectations. We delivered our seventh consecutive quarter of profitability by generating $41.4 million in net income compared to $89.7 million during last year's first quarter. \r\nA decrease in adjusted EBITDA and higher income tax expense contributed to this result, and these factors were partially offset by lower interest expense and a lower LIFO charge. \r\nAdjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $282.6 million as compared to $344.8 million during the prior year period. This result was driven by a reduction in pharmacy gross profit due to lower reimbursement rates that were not offset with reductions in generic drug costs. \r\nWe also had higher salary and payroll-related expenses as we continue to make investments in our business. As announced in February, we are transitioning to a new drug sourcing and distribution process through our expanded partnership with McKesson. This new process is expected to deliver long-term drug cost savings, and will provide our pharmacies with direct-to-store delivery 5 days a week, which will provide significant working capital benefits. \r\nAs we transition to our new purchasing model, we expect lower pharmacy gross margin during the transition period because we are unable to negotiate lower drug costs, as we normally would do, to offset reimbursement rate pressure in generic drug cost increases. \r\nThis increased vulnerability to reimbursement rate changes and generic drug cost increases will continue during a portion of the second quarter as we complete the transition. \r\nA significant portion of the change we made to our fiscal 2015 guidance on June 5 reflects that the negative gross margin impact of this transition was greater than we anticipated because reimbursement rate pressures were more significant than we expected, and the timing of savings realized from the McKesson agreement is slower than our original estimates. \r\nAlthough this transition is longer than we expected, this new sourcing and distribution model is a groundbreaking opportunity for us. And as we work through this transition, I'm confident this is the right strategic step to drive our long-term success. We're really excited about how this partnership will allow us to achieve supply chain efficiencies, provide even better service to our customers and generate additional cash flow to fuel our long-term growth. \r\nAs I mentioned earlier, we delivered a strong store operating performance during the quarter, including solid revenue growth and positive comps for same-store sales and prescription counts. \r\nWe also held the line on front-end same-store sales, which were flat for the quarter, as we strike a balance between maintaining front-end margins and remaining competitive in a highly promotional environment. \r\nIn terms of our script count, there are indications that the Affordable Care Act is beginning to have a positive impact, as we are experiencing growth in states that have expanded Medicaid. \r\nIn addition, we are seeing higher utilization among our patients. \r\nWe continue to make significant progress with our key initiatives as we transition our strategy to more aggressively pursuing opportunities for long-term growth. \r\nIn a few moments, Ken will talk about -- more about our Wellness Store program and the continued success of our remodeling efforts. \r\nFrom a strategic standpoint, it's important to note that our Wellness Stores will serve as a primary vehicle for launching innovative merchandising solutions, expanded health care offerings, and over the next few years, our relocation and new store program. \r\nNext week, we will hold the groundbreaking -- the ground -- the grand reopening of a Wellness Store on North Canon Drive in Beverly Hills that illustrates how we're aggressively evolving the format to identify additional features that can be broadly applied to future remodels and other features that can be implemented in select stores with specific growth opportunities. \r\nWellness Stores will also serve as the foundation for expanding our health care offering, including our Rite Aid Health Alliance program for patients with chronic and polychronic conditions, as well as adding RediClinics to Rite Aid stores. \r\nWe recently expanded our Health Alliance pilot by announcing a new partnership with Penn State Hershey Health System in Hershey, Pennsylvania. We are encouraged by the initial result of our pilots, which are now active in 4 markets. \r\nWe continue to focus on forming partnerships with additional medical practices as we look to provide a higher level of care and support patients with chronic and polychronic conditions. \r\nIn addition, the integration of Health Dialog into the Rite Aid family has been smooth thus far, and this new subsidiary is providing the in-store care coaches to support the Health Alliance program in these new markets. \r\nWe're also making strong progress as we integrate RediClinic into our operating structure.

Frank?\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Frank Vitrano (Executives)】\nThanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone. First quarter results reflect pharmacy product cost and reimbursement rate challenges despite strengthening script count and front-end trends, as well as continued progress from our various initiatives. \r\nOn the call this morning, I plan to walk through our first quarter financial results, discuss our liquidity position, certain balance sheet items, our capital expenditure plan and finally, review of our fiscal '15 annual guidance. \r\nRevenue for the quarter was $6.5 billion, which was $172 million or 2.7% higher than last year's first quarter. The increase was due to higher pharmacy sales. \r\nOverall, same-store sales increased 3.1% in the quarter, reflecting higher pharmacy script count and inflation rate. \r\nFront-end same-store sales were flat compared to last year. Pharmacy same-store sales were higher by 4.6%, which had included an approximate 143-basis-point negative impact from new generic drugs compared to a 450-basis-point negative impact from new generic drugs in the prior year's first quarter. \r\nPharmacy same-store comp scripts were up 230 basis points, reflecting higher utilization, particularly in Medicaid expansion states. \r\nAdjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $282.6 million or 4.4% of revenues, which was $62 million -- $62.2 million lower than last year's first quarter of $344.8 million or 5.5% of revenues. The current quarter's results were primarily driven by lower pharmacy gross profit due to lower reimbursement rates that we were unable to offset with the reductions in generic costs, as well as higher SG&A. \r\nNet income for the quarter was $41.4 million or $0.04 per diluted share, compared to last year's first quarter net income of $89.7 million or $0.09 per diluted share. \r\nDecline was driven by the $62.2 million decline in adjusted EBITDA and a higher income tax expense, partially offset by lower interest expense, LIFO and lease termination and impairment charges as compared to last year. \r\nIncome tax expense was recorded to maintain a full tax valuation allowance for the company's deferred tax assets. The increase was driven by higher stock-based compensation expense for tax purposes. The valuation allowance increase is a noncash item. \r\nRefinancings completed in March of this year and June of '13 drove the reduction in interest expense. The lower LIFO charge was driven by an expected decrease in inventory levels. \r\nTotal gross profit dollars in the quarter were $18 million lower than last year's first quarter and 105 basis points lower as a percent to revenues. \r\nAdjusted EBITDA gross profit, which excludes specific items, primarily LIFO and the wellness+ revenue deferral, was unfavorable to the prior year's first quarter by $28.7 million and lower by 123 basis points as a percent to revenues. \r\nPharmacy gross profit dollars and margin rate were lower. Pharmacy gross profit was impacted by continued reimbursement rate pressure that we were unable to offset with reductions in generic costs due to a delay in realizing the level of generic price reductions we expected from our purchasing arrangement. \r\nFront-end gross profit dollars and rate were flat to last year. These items were partially offset by the inclusion of Health Dialog and RediClinic revenues in this year's results. \r\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter were higher by $35.1 million and 14 basis points lower as a percent to revenues compared to last year. \r\nAdjusted EBITDA SG&A dollars, which excludes specific items, were higher by $33.4 million and 12 basis points lower as a percent to revenues compared to last year. \r\nThe increase was driven by $14.7 million in operating and deal cost related to the recent acquisition of Health Dialog and RediClinic. \r\nWages and benefit increases drove the balance of the increase, partially offset by our various expense control initiatives. \r\nFIFO inventory was lower than the first quarter of last year by $110 million, primarily driven by initiatives to better manage inventory levels. \r\nOur cash flow statement results for the quarter shows net cash from operating activities as the source of $239.7 million as compared to a source of $184.5 million in last year's first quarter, with lower inventory and timing differences in accounts payable driving the variance. \r\nNet cash used in investment activities for the quarter was $177.4 million versus $82.1 million last year. \r\nDuring the quarter, we remodeled 105 stores, expanded 1 store, relocated 3 stores and closed 7 stores. \r\nAt the end of the first quarter of fiscal '15, we have completed and grand reopened 1,325 Wellness Stores. \r\nIn the first quarter of fiscal '15, front-end same-store sales in the Wellness Stores exceeded the non-Wellness Stores by 265 basis points, and script growth in the Wellness Stores exceeded the non-Wellness Stores by 120 basis points. \r\nNow let's discuss liquidity. At the end of the first quarter, we had $1.368 billion of liquidity. Our liquidity has increased $226 million over last year. We had $351 million of borrowing outstanding under our $1.8 billion senior secured facility, with $88 million of outstanding letters of credit. \r\nTotal debt, net of invested cash, was lower by $208 million from last year's first quarter. Our leverage ratio, defined as total debt less invested cash over LTM adjusted EBITDA, improved to 4.5x from 4.9x as compared to the first quarter of fiscal '14. \r\nNow let's turn to fiscal '15 guidance, which was released on June 5 with our May sales results. We updated our guidance based upon a shortfall in the first quarter earnings, which was primarily driven by pharmacy margin trends, as discussed before, as well as an updated time line to achieve a lower gross -- to lower generic purchase price reductions from our purchasing arrangement. \r\nWe also adjusted for delays in the introduction of certain new generics, as well as the impact of January 1 plan changes. The guidance also reflects continued reimbursement rate pressure and more drug cost increases than normal. We have also updated our assumptions concerning AMP, as we now expect that it will not be implemented in fiscal '15. \r\nThe guidance includes incremental expense control initiatives to partially offset the pharmacy margin pressures. \r\nWe updated our LIFO provision for the year based upon the anticipated reduction in pharmacy inventory, both at the stores and DCs. Our guidance does include the anticipated benefit of our Wellness remodel program, customer loyalty program and other initiatives to grow sales and drive operating efficiencies. \r\nWe expect the current promotional environment to -- we expect the current competitive environment to remain promotional. We also considered planned wages and benefit increases. \r\nWe increased our expected working capital benefit to $250 million from $150 million as a result of the McKesson agreement. We are seeing early results reflecting lower store pharmacy inventory as a result of more frequent direct store deliveries. The previous guidance only included the distribution center inventory reductions, and working capital benefit will not be fully realized until the fourth quarter of fiscal '15. \r\nWe expect script growth benefits from ACA, favorable demographics, file buy acquisitions, growth in immunizations and other initiatives. \r\nAs was mentioned on the fiscal '14 earnings call in April, we expected the second half of fiscal '15 to be stronger than the first 2 quarters, due in part to the strength of fiscal '14's first half, as well as the introduction of new generics in the second half of fiscal '15. \r\nOur second quarter comparison to the comparable quarter last year will be impacted by the previously disclosed $23.5 million prescription drug antitrust settlement in last year's second quarter, as well as the timing in realizing the run rate benefits of the expanded partnership with McKesson. \r\nThe company expects sales to be between $26 billion and $26.5 billion, and expected adjusted EBITDA to be between $1.275 billion and $1.35 billion in fiscal '15. \r\nSame-store sales are expected to be in a range of an increase of 2.5% to 4.5%, including the anticipated negative pharmacy sales impact of approximately 240 basis points from new generic introductions and continued reimbursement rate pressure. \r\nWe expect a fiscal '15 earnings range of net income of $298 million or earnings per diluted share of $0.30 to net income of $408 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.40. \r\nThe range of guidance is primarily driven by our same-store sales range and pharmacy margin. \r\nOur guidance includes investments to integrate both RediClinic and Health Dialog, and we plan to open an additional 70 RediClinics over the next 18 months. \r\nFiscal 2015 capital expenditure plan is to spend $525 million, with $225 million allocated to remodels and $90 million to file buys. \r\nWe are planning to open 1 new store, complete 19 relocations and remodel 450 Wellness Stores in fiscal '15. \r\nWe expect free cash flow to be in a range of $400 million to $450 million for the year, including the benefit of lower pharmacy inventory and the acquisition of RediClinic and Health Dialog. \r\nWe expect to close a total of 40 stores, of which the guidance includes a store lease closing provision for '15, with the balance closing upon lease expiration. \r\nThe guidance also assumes that we will call and prepay our 10.25% second-lien notes due in 2019 sometime after the next call premium step-down in October. \r\nThat completes my portion of the presentation. I'd now like to turn it back to John.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: John Standley (Executives)】\nThank you, Frank. Before we open the phone lines for questions, I'd just like to thank our dedicated associates for their commitment to executing our key initiatives and their contributions to our strong store operating performance during the first quarter. \r\nLooking ahead, we believe that our strategy to expand our health care offering is the right strategy to position Rite Aid for growth in this changing health care environment and delivering long-term value for our stakeholders. \r\nWe will continue to focus on further developing our existing programs, while aggressively pursuing new opportunities to deliver convenient, affordable and effective health care solutions to the communities we serve. \r\nThat concludes our prepared remarks for this morning. We will now open the phone lines for questions.",
      "transcript_text3": "I was wondering if maybe we could just talk about reimbursement pressure a little bit more. Is this really more of a shift to more Medicaid patients, where generally reimbursement is lower based on your comments around ACA? Or did you have a change in any of your contracting with the PBMs or managed care companies? Just trying to understand the reimbursement pressure that you saw in the first quarter.\n\n---\n\nSure. I guess, a couple of things. The lower reimbursement rate we talked about related to ACA was primarily driven by the migration to AMP or really -- was really for Medicaid reimbursement rates. As you may have noticed, that has been delayed. We're not sure what precisely the implementation date will be or the implementation of AMP, but we expect it's likely going to be outside of this fiscal year. So as it relates to the Affordable Care Act, I think that was really kind of where we were going there. In terms of reimbursement rate pressures, then I guess there's a few things. We're always dealing with a competitive reimbursement rate environment. Things that can develop differently than our plans would include just the mix of business amongst and within plans. So migration to narrow networks and business moving between different types of plans can have an impact on reimbursement rates. We also still have certain contracts that are not on any kind of guaranteed rate. We've always called those kind of MAC contracts, so those can be a little bit more volatile. So it's really, I think, kind of a combination of those things, where we saw some reimbursement rate pressure in this particular quarter that was greater than our expectation.\n\n---\n\nAnd so, John, if I hear you correctly, it sounds like it wasn't that you had an issue of people with more Medicaid coming in, but rather it was the mix within your commercial book of business and you still have a number of your commercial contracts that have MAC rates. And therefore, just given where you were able to buy the generics versus the way that -- whether it's a PBM or managed care company, could MAC you, it's the difference in that, that was different than your expectation when you gave us guidance in April, is that correct?\n\n---\n\nYes, so that's definitely a piece of it. In terms of the way we see Medicaid prescriptions come through today, they're really -- there are still some Medicaid that are managed directly by states and there's a lot of Medicaid that is now actually managed by third-party plans. And when you blend all that together, our overall Medicaid rates don't look a lot different than our managed care rates today. So that increase in Medicaid was not a significant driver in the change in our reimbursement rate expectation. If you talk about some MAC-ing activity, that is definitely a piece of the puzzle. Plan mix is the other piece I'll just reemphasize again as well.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then just secondly, you gave guidance in April. I'm just curious about the timing around McKesson and procurement of generics. Did you have a different expectation when you gave the guidance in April or is it just that we, on The Street, perhaps have modeled it wrong sequentially through the quarters and got the first quarter incorrect based on your commentary?\n\n---\n\nI think we had a different expectation. And I know a lot of people called McKesson and what did they say and what did Rite Aid say and how does it all fit together. One thing I would tell you is that this is a very significant transition for us. Generic purchasing is a very big part of our business. We went into this agreement with our eyes wide open about the complexity of it and what would be involved. And when we talked, when we gave our guidance originally, we mentioned that we thought the first half was going to be softer for a few reasons, and this was definitely one of them. Because during the transition period of moving from managing the cost ourselves to having McKesson manage our cost, there is just a period of vulnerability that occurs here where we don't have as much leverage in the marketplace. So there are a couple of different things going on. One, the savings that we got on our own bids last year erode over time because there are cost increases that occurred that gradually began to offset that, and we no longer have our hands on the levers that allow us to manage costs day-to-day. So this sort of in-between period is allowing reimbursement rate pressure and generic cost increases to kind of get right through into the margin fairly quickly, where in the past, we would have had more levers to work with internally to slow those things down. When we gave our guidance, we built it around the expectation that towards the end of the first quarter, these savings would be available to us to help offset those pressures. The timing has turned out to be a little slower than that. And so that's kind of a piece of how we got to where we are.\n\n---\n\nBut it sounds like these are transient, that rates -- once you're able to work towards this relationship starting more so -- if I remember correctly, it's around August 1, which is where more of this will happen, that this is really just a timing issue. Am I thinking about that correctly? And then I'll hop off.\n\n---\n\nYes. I think there is a very significant timing issue here involved. No question about it. I'm not sure we gave that date, August 1. So I'll not confirm that date. But what we have said is that the savings will build during the second quarter.\n\n---\n\nThis is actually Judah on for Ed. I wanted to touch a little more on the reimbursement pressure. How much of this do you think is related to generics coming in later than you expected? You mentioned kind of adjusting the timing for the roll-on of some big generics. Would we be talking as much about this if you had some of those big generics in there right now?\n\n---\n\nYes. I mean, we originally thought that Nexium, we original anticipated Nexium was going to come in earlier in the year. And as we updated our guidance here in June, in our forecast, we pushed that out to not expect it to come until much later in the year.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And the reimbursement pressure, how much would you say is specific to Rite Aid based on whether it's MAC contracts or other factors? And how much is just kind of general pricing pressure in the marketplace?\n\n---\n\nThat's a question I cannot answer for you. We're certainly privy to what happens here, but I have no idea what other companies' contracts are, what they look like or how they work or the timing of renewals, that kind of thing.\n\n---\n\nFirst question, I was wondering, when you look at a RediClinic remodel and are putting a RediClinic in a store versus an traditional Wellness remodel, what's the difference in cost of that relative remodel? And what type of lift in sales are you anticipating versus the lifts you're getting today of roughly 265 bps on the front-end and 120 on scripts?\n\n---\n\nSo I guess, the answer to the question is we think RediClinic is going to provide not only revenue through the clinic, but additional script count as well, so it's -- we kind of -- we sort of get a pick-up in both spots. So in terms of a Wellness renovation, it would significantly help us on the comp side. In terms of cost associated with it...\n\n---\n\nRight now, we're estimating about $200,000 to put a RediClinic in. And I would assume, Bryan, that we have to put a bathroom in as well.\n\n---\n\nVery good. And next, more of a capital structure question. It sounds like you're going to pay off this 10.25% with cash and you'll generate plenty of free cash flow to manage that process. When you look at your capital structure going forward, I mean, you've got first lien debt, second lien debt, secured debt, and unsecured debt. I was wondering, can you give us maybe a little look into what your plan would be for, one, managing the level of leverage into kind what your optimal secured and unsecured capital structure would look like?\n\n---\n\nYes. I mean, Bryan we -- we're always looking at the capital structure. And with regard to leverage here, we talked about, on prior calls, that we would like to get to a leverage ratio that has a three handle on it, and that's something that we're continuing to strive for. This year, we're forecasting to generate $400 million to $450 million of free cash flow that will help us to begin to pay down our debt here. And with regard to our capital structure, that's something that we continue to look at and to monitor on a long-term basis here. Obviously, we have seen some fairly significant improvement in our unsecured rates, which become more attractive, and that might be something that we would consider looking to access the unsecured market at some point in the future. But I think in the short-term, really looking at -- the opportunity that we have is really looking at the higher coupon indentures that we have and looking at the call premiums and see what's the appropriate time for us to refinance them.\n\n---\n\nAnd my last question, as you approach that 3x leverage ratio, I mean, you made some small acquisitions of RediClinic and some other businesses and you're looking at script growth. Is there anything that would prevent you at all -- or do you feel more comfortable as leverage drops to maybe start to get into the storefront acquisition game? And what type of size, what -- I mean, would you consider end markets or would you talk about expanding markets, and that's it for me.\n\n---\n\nBoth. That's a Frank versus John discussion right there. Buy, buy. Oh, no.\n\n---\n\nCan they battle it out on the call?\n\n---\n\nWhat's that?\n\n---\n\nI said, can they battle it out on the call?\n\n---\n\nYes, we can definitely do that for you. No, we're -- I think we've said all along, we're very opportunistically-minded. We want to do the right things for our company and our business. And if there's something that makes sense to us, and it could be an existing market, maybe it could be outside an existing market, we'd take a hard look at it, so...\n\n---\n\nSomewhat lost in the announcement from June 5 was the fact that same-store sales continued to improve. And in particular, same-store sales script seems to be accelerating month over month so far this year. Could you guys maybe talk a little bit about what's embedded in your full year same-store sales guidance as it relates to script growth? And I guess, just as a part of that, maybe any update on assumptions around what you're seeing or expect to see from exchange lives and Medicaid expansion?\n\n---\n\nWell, in terms of same-store sales assumption, as I mentioned, we're looking to see 2.5% to 4.5% increases. We don't really provide any more specific color around specific script growth. However, we're clearly encouraged by the script growth, as well as the front-end trends that we're seeing here.\n\n---\n\nWhat was the second half of that? The Medicaid question.\n\n---\n\nWell, no -- I mean, just the -- as we've seen scripts improve, same-store scripts improve month-over-month, and looking at the full year total same-store sales, I'm just curious, as we've seen the script growth, is there anything that you're seeing today contributing directly from Medicaid expansion or exchange lives, and what's the assumption for the remainder of the year as it relates to script growth?\n\n---\n\nOkay, sorry. So the first half of the question I think I can answer, which is in terms of what we've seen from the Affordable Care Act, it's fairly consistent with I think what we said in our last call, which is, in terms of exchange-based plans, probably 70% of the people that we can identify related to an exchange-based plan came from another plan where we already have them as a customer. So the net incremental piece of that was much smaller, and those people, those net incremental patients are -- haven't been huge utilizers yet. So the utilization, as a percentage of those plans, is probably less than the average. A little bit of a different story in the Medicaid. In the Medicaid expansion states, we've seen strong script growth, as Frank mentioned in his comments, particularly when you compare them to the non-Medicaid expansion states, where this isn't much growth. So it's clearly had an impact and it was a pretty strong contributor, we think, to the trends that you're seeing on our script count right now. As it relates to guidance right now, probably script count is in line with our expectations. I guess, that's probably the right way to say it.\n\n---\n\nNo, that's fair. And then, I guess, just one follow up on the reimbursement pressures that you guys highlighted. I know your competitors have talked a lot about trying to insulate themselves away from these types of contracts that can change so abruptly. Any update on how you've been progressing in moving away from this type of contracting?\n\n---\n\nYes, we work -- I think we worked hard over the last several years to move to fewer contracts where we don't have as much visibility into how rates will behave over time, but we do still have some left that we're working on. We're probably 60% or something that we're -- 60% to 70% of our managed care contracts are now more sort of guaranteed rate-type contracts. And I'll just emphasize one more time, we definitely have some volatility in the MAC-ing contracts. There's also some mix issues kind of rolling around in here as well.\n\n---\n\nSo a couple of things. On reimbursement, how would you compare the volatility and what you saw this year to last year, the year before? Was there more this year, was it harder to judge it this year than past years?\n\n---\n\nI'd say two things to that, John. In terms of the overall rate decline versus a year ago, if you looked at the first quarter last year versus the first quarter this year, the rate decline this year is less, which makes common sense because we don't have any significant LOEs or new generics or anything that are kind of coming around where there should be a significant rate decline. However, I would say that in terms of volatility or predictability, probably a little bit worse for us. We have some things going on I think this quarter that will probably be different than what we saw last quarter. And the last piece I would tell you is, last year, when we saw that, because we had a little bit more -- we had direct control over generic purchasing at that time, we were able to react in ways to help offset it, where right now, until we get this thing fully transitioned, we're a little stuck in the middle.\n\n---\n\nWell, good. It sounds like that's -- the bigger piece is not that the plan design changed on you, it's that the midcourse corrections, you had no flexibility to do normal midcourse corrections that you might have -- that you did a year ago or before that, is that fair?\n\n---\n\nSome of both, but both are important.\n\n---\n\nBecause if that's true, the follow-up to that would be -- the 28% gross margin that is -- I don't want to say it's not realistic, but it's sort of not apples-to-apples because of your hamstringed ability to do direct buying yourself. Is that fair? And is there a catch-up? Or is that gross -- are those gross profit dollars lost? Or when you get this thing with McKesson ramped, some of that flows back in later quarters?\n\n---\n\nSo I think what you said initially is correct in terms of there's definitely a piece of this that's related, specifically because we're kind of stuck in the middle here. Based on the way you see us adjusting our guidance, I think you can conclude that a piece of it, we think, is lost for the fiscal year. We don't get it back.\n\n---\n\nNo, so I'd just -- I mean, you'll get a ramp in McKesson normally, but not -- there's not a catch-up -- there's not a bulky catch-up ever from this?\n\n---\n\nThat's correct. I think we believe there was going to a transition period and there was going to be some costs associated with it. It was cost that was a little bit difficult to quantify and it's not an expense item on the P&L. It's coming through a lower margin rate. So -- but it just is more than we expected when we started this thing. But even considering kind of where we've come out here, when we look at the overall benefits of the relationship, still very, very strong believers that we're headed in the right direction even though we've got a little bit of painful period to work through to get there.\n\n---\n\nAnd then the last one, you guys have never quantified -- I mean, you're not going to, but...\n\n---\n\n[indiscernible].\n\n---\n\nWhat is the -- from what you sit today, is it the same as you thought 3 or 4 -- putting the transition period aside, is it more than you thought, the same, less than you thought, say 3 or 4 months ago?\n\n---\n\nIn line with our expectations.\n\n---\n\nFrank, on -- with respect to the plan changes and the plan mix, should we think of there being like a significant, I would call it, a prior period purchase adjustment, where you renegotiated payer plans somewhere, I would guess, between April 10 and June 5, it had to be retroactive to the quarter, that drove kind of a portion of the negative revision?\n\n---\n\nYou made a bunch of leaps there that I wouldn't make. Yes, so we negotiate -- honestly, we have contracts negotiating all the time. So just for whatever that's worth, there's contract negotiations all the time. But I think what we sort of talked about is we have some contracts that are still MAC-based contracts that didn't behave well during the quarter. We have change in plan mix amongst plans in the quarter, so I'm not sure I follow the retroactive thing you said.\n\n---\n\nYes. Well, I was just trying to -- look, I guess, what I'm trying to figure out is what changed between April 10, when you guys gave the guidance for the year, and June 5, when the revision was announced.\n\n---\n\nYes, so couple of things. We were hopeful, as we entered into the quarter and gave our guidance, that there were going to be some savings from our McKesson relationship that would help us manage some issues that were showing up in our numbers, more difficult reimbursement rates than we expected, some higher generic drug costs and, unfortunately, due to a number of different things, those savings are just showing up a little bit later than we expected. So we were not able to offset some of the things that were developing in the quarter in a way we thought was possible at the time we gave that guidance.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And I guess, if we think about -- like the reimbursement perspective, we talked about plan-specific items. Is the right way to think about that -- would an example of that being ESI having written to their contracts that they get to determine what's a generic drug, what's a branded generic, what's a branded drug, and force that upon you. And that, like that's a term that you guys are trying to negotiate out of future contracts? I guess, I'm trying to understand examples of kind of what drove the negative reimbursement pressure.\n\n---\n\nSure. So I'll go back to kind of 2 basic examples. The first one will be around some -- a contract that where we saw more volatility than we expected. So we might have a contract where, on generic drugs, there is a proprietary MAC list that PBM uses. They don't often provide us their proprietary MAC list. And so they have flexibility to adjust generic drug costs as they go. So it's a little -- sometimes, we have a little bit of difficulty getting good insight as to how that's going to behave over time. And some of those contracts did behave well during the quarter, so that's one example of something that we saw related to generic purchasing or generic reimbursement rates. Another situation would be, we might have a contract with a PBM, where we're in 3 different plans: one is a very narrow plan, one is a medium plan and one is a broad plan. And we might see as we come through into the fiscal year, gradually, as there's utilization, that the PBM has migrated patients from the broad plan, which has the highest reimbursement rate, to either the middle plan or the lowest reimbursement rate plan. We call that a change in plan mix and we saw some of that activity as well. Those things tend to develop over time. When a plan change goes into effect January 1, you need utilization, you need time, you need claims to really see how these things are going to develop. Oftentimes, as we come through January and February, where we don't always have great insight as to where rates are really trending in the year because of so much activity between patients moving between PBMs and patients moving within plans inside of PBMs and the way PBMs are passing reimbursement rate back to us, quite honestly, that it takes a little while until you get real visibility into where you are. And so you've got to stir all that together and combine it with the fact that in the past, again, we would have probably been a little more active on the purchasing side in terms of driving some cost out to try and react to those things that we were unable to do in this particular time frame.\n\n---\n\nJohn, that's very helpful. And then maybe just the last, a quick follow-up. Is the narrow network trend then on the PBM side negatively impacting you guys? And do you guys have the scale to participate and compete against PBMs that want to drop [ph] narrow pharmacy networks? And then I'll hop off.\n\n---\n\nYes, that's a great question. I do think the narrow network thing continues to build a little bit and I think we see it not only in our managed care plans, but also probably in Medicare Part D plans as well. And that gets right back to one of the important strategic reasons why we need to be very competitive on our drug cost, which is why we started down the road on this McKesson relationship to begin with. The combined purchasing power, we think, over the long term will make us a competitive provider of solid drug prescription delivery over the long term, which is really kind of where we're going with the McKesson relationship, that's why we're there.\n\n---\n\nSo I guess, in this case, I apologize in advance for sort of a granular business mechanics question. But just to make sure I understand this. I guess, the discussion on the call suggests that, historically, if you start to get MAC-ed a little bit, it kind of implies you can quickly go to manufacturers and buy it cheaper to partially offset this. Obviously, you're saying that, temporarily, you can't do this under the McKesson transition. So I guess, 2 questions would be: one, did you lose some -- maybe some special relationships with generic manufacturers, and that's why you're a little bit handcuffed right now; but also, question number two, what will change, I guess, just mechanically with McKesson in the future that will allow you and McKesson, again, to quickly adapt to Rite Aid's specific reimbursement changes? I'm curious if some of the generic buying is specifically tied to MAC prices, but just any extra color around this would definitely be helpful.\n\n---\n\nYes, sure. So quickly is a relative term. I mean, you can't do it in days. But certainly, in weeks and months, you can. And again, probably the difference would be as we -- maybe as came through the first quarter, if we saw coming out the reimbursement rates were going to be tough, to the extent we had visibility to it, we would be active in the marketplace trying to figure out why that is, why is somebody MAC-ing us, is there a cost available in the marketplace to help us offset that, and we would be working that throughout the quarter. So it's not instantaneous, it isn't reimbursement rates are low today, we're going to call somebody and find a lower cost. So I don't want to necessarily imply that. But it is a bit of a hand-in-glove process that you have to work through to manage both sides of the equation to get everything to kind of work together, which right now, until we make a full transition here, is a little bit more difficult to do. So in terms of relationships with manufacturers, our team is working hard with McKesson to continue to build the valuable relationships that we've built over the years. And I think McKesson understands our business needs in terms of how we need to manage our business. And we're hopeful that as we work together with them as a team, we'll be able to achieve the savings over the long term that we need to manage our business. We -- how quickly we can move collectively as a team, those things will work out over time. But in the long run, we still believe strategically this is the right way to go.\n\n---\n\nSo in the future, you'll just have to be more aggressive on communicating with them if you're getting MAC-ed, and then, hopefully, they can make the adjustments.\n\n---\n\nThat's correct. That's just going to be another [indiscernible]. That's correct.\n\n---\n\nYou talked a bit about the working capital benefits from the new McKesson arrangement. Are you expecting working capital to be a source of cash for the year? Because it looks like payables came down with the inventory this quarter, causing less of a source than we would have expected.\n\n---\n\nYes. I mean, in terms of -- we got about $100 million benefit from inventory. A piece of it -- the payable was really just a timing issue in terms from fourth quarter to first quarter here. But we do expect that we're going to get a net working capital benefit from the McKesson agreement, $150 million of which should come primarily out of the distribution centers. And then right now, we're expecting another $100 million-or-so that would come out of the stores.\n\n---\n\nAnd Carla, we haven't guided into details of any kind of impact this has on payables, but that $250 million is net of any payable impact.\n\n---\n\nOkay, great. And then you've talked a lot about the Affordable Care Act, but how do you expect that to impact you on the cost side? How many of your employees are eligible?\n\n---\n\nSo a couple of years ago, we really migrated our plans to a compliant structure. So we've absorbed those cost changes in our plans over the last couple of years. I don't think there's anything significant for this year. Like in 2018 or something, we'll have to make -- by 2018, we'll have to make some further plan changes to avoid excise taxes and that kind of stuff, but it's not significant this fiscal year.\n\n---\n\nOkay, great. And then if I can add one more. You talked about some of the new formats or new tests you're trying, the Fresh Day Café, enhanced beauty. How many stores are in the test for those and what's the time frame? When you find something that works, how long does it take to roll it out to all the Wellness Stores?\n\n---\n\nThat's a fairly complicated question. Some of these have application to all stores if they do well, and there are bits and pieces of some of these things that will roll out in all stores. Beauty is a good example. Over the last couple of years, we've fairly dramatically changed the way that we merchandise and we roll this -- the beauty departments out. There are some things that we're rolling out backwards into other Wellness Stores like our nail bars. We've gone backwards and put them into a bunch of stores because we saw they were very, very effective in growing that business. Other things like some of the new merchandising displays that we've got in Beverly Hills will be more on a go-forward basis on some of the higher potential stores. So it's really a mix. It depends on what the initiative is and what the cost is to get it implemented, so it's almost an initiative-by-initiative basis.\n\n---\n\nI realize this is significantly less relevant than it used to be, but just wanted to get a sense of the script file valuations. Are we still in the kind of the $10 to $20 range when we're out purchasing scripts?\n\n---\n\nYes, I would say maybe it's inched up a little bit, Karru. So maybe it's $13 to $20 or something like that, but that's generally the range.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then where are these file buys coming from? I mean, how much of the overall market kind of still remains local or mom-and-pop?\n\n---\n\nIf you look at the stats, there's still about 10% of kind of the total doors that are out there that are independent. And we continue to send out fliers, knock on doors. And I guess for some of these smaller guys, they're continuing to see reimbursement rate pressure and whatnot and decide it's time to move on, do something different, or in some instances, come work for us.\n\n---\n\nAnd when you look at some of the more regional players or some of the alternate channels, grocery stores with pharmacies and so forth, I mean, as reimbursement rate pressure rises, do you see some of these guys getting out of the business? Is that an opportunity or is that just going to be -- continue to be part of their business?\n\n---\n\nNo. I mean, we have seen some small chains, 3 or 4 or 5 store -- grocery stores that have decided to either close or get out of the business. Those have been some of the opportunities. And then there's been some Kmarts out there that are on the market. But generally, it's generally more the independents is who we're buying it from.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And just lastly, you guys mentioned increasing your smoking cessation program. If you could just remind us kind of what's the view right now in terms of tobacco sales within the chain?\n\n---\n\nWell, at this point, we've got a lot of our customers and patients that are currently buying tobacco products. And for whatever personal reason they have, they made that decision. And at this point, we think that we can probably deliver a great solution for those customers when they decide to quit smoking. One thing that we do know is the vast majority of tobacco users, at some point, make that decision and we think that we're uniquely positioned to deliver for those folks. So we're trying to develop a program that integrates all the resources that we have available to us to provide them with the most extensive support system that we possibly can. So we're looking forward to rolling that out in late summer, and we think it's going to be pretty exciting.\n\n---\n\nA couple of questions. As you add these new departments and you add the medi clinics, what's coming out? Where -- how are you making room for these things and what are the categories that are kind of going to shrink?\n\n---\n\nWell, I think in general, it's probably consistent with what's been happening in the Wellness Stores. As we look to further build out the health care services that we're providing to our patients back in the pharmacy area, it does put pressure on the front-end. And typically, we're growing the footprint on the front-end in health and beauty, in vitamins and better-for-you foods and the things that support living a healthy lifestyle. And so it clearly puts pressure on some of the general merchandise categories and miscellaneous categories that don't as closely support that. So I think what you've seen in the Wellness Stores will probably continue as the evolution rolls forward.\n\n---\n\nIs there a potential, with the medi clinics, to also provide dialysis services?\n\n---\n\nNot with where we're heading with RediClinic.\n\n---\n\nOkay, fair enough. And I'm sorry if I missed this. Did you say how many store closures we should expect this year?\n\n---\n\n40, Karen.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And final question, I saw this ad TV and I thought it was an intriguing app. But GoodRx, which does pharmacy comparisons and coupons for prescriptions, and they did specifically list you guys as someone who is kind of a participant in this. Is this something that could have an impact on the industry?\n\n---\n\nI'd have to look at that more carefully. Honestly, I'm not sure. So much of our business is insured. I just have to see what it does.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. I appreciate it.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Lisa Gill (Analysts)】\nI was wondering if maybe we could just talk about reimbursement pressure a little bit more. Is this really more of a shift to more Medicaid patients, where generally reimbursement is lower based on your comments around ACA? Or did you have a change in any of your contracting with the PBMs or managed care companies? Just trying to understand the reimbursement pressure that you saw in the first quarter.\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nSure. I guess, a couple of things. The lower reimbursement rate we talked about related to ACA was primarily driven by the migration to AMP or really -- was really for Medicaid reimbursement rates. As you may have noticed, that has been delayed. We're not sure what precisely the implementation date will be or the implementation of AMP, but we expect it's likely going to be outside of this fiscal year. So as it relates to the Affordable Care Act, I think that was really kind of where we were going there. In terms of reimbursement rate pressures, then I guess there's a few things. We're always dealing with a competitive reimbursement rate environment. Things that can develop differently than our plans would include just the mix of business amongst and within plans. So migration to narrow networks and business moving between different types of plans can have an impact on reimbursement rates. We also still have certain contracts that are not on any kind of guaranteed rate. We've always called those kind of MAC contracts, so those can be a little bit more volatile. So it's really, I think, kind of a combination of those things, where we saw some reimbursement rate pressure in this particular quarter that was greater than our expectation.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Lisa Gill (Analysts)】\nAnd so, John, if I hear you correctly, it sounds like it wasn't that you had an issue of people with more Medicaid coming in, but rather it was the mix within your commercial book of business and you still have a number of your commercial contracts that have MAC rates. And therefore, just given where you were able to buy the generics versus the way that -- whether it's a PBM or managed care company, could MAC you, it's the difference in that, that was different than your expectation when you gave us guidance in April, is that correct?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nYes, so that's definitely a piece of it. In terms of the way we see Medicaid prescriptions come through today, they're really -- there are still some Medicaid that are managed directly by states and there's a lot of Medicaid that is now actually managed by third-party plans. And when you blend all that together, our overall Medicaid rates don't look a lot different than our managed care rates today. So that increase in Medicaid was not a significant driver in the change in our reimbursement rate expectation. If you talk about some MAC-ing activity, that is definitely a piece of the puzzle. Plan mix is the other piece I'll just reemphasize again as well.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Lisa Gill (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then just secondly, you gave guidance in April. I'm just curious about the timing around McKesson and procurement of generics. Did you have a different expectation when you gave the guidance in April or is it just that we, on The Street, perhaps have modeled it wrong sequentially through the quarters and got the first quarter incorrect based on your commentary?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nI think we had a different expectation. And I know a lot of people called McKesson and what did they say and what did Rite Aid say and how does it all fit together. One thing I would tell you is that this is a very significant transition for us. Generic purchasing is a very big part of our business. We went into this agreement with our eyes wide open about the complexity of it and what would be involved. And when we talked, when we gave our guidance originally, we mentioned that we thought the first half was going to be softer for a few reasons, and this was definitely one of them. Because during the transition period of moving from managing the cost ourselves to having McKesson manage our cost, there is just a period of vulnerability that occurs here where we don't have as much leverage in the marketplace. So there are a couple of different things going on. One, the savings that we got on our own bids last year erode over time because there are cost increases that occurred that gradually began to offset that, and we no longer have our hands on the levers that allow us to manage costs day-to-day. So this sort of in-between period is allowing reimbursement rate pressure and generic cost increases to kind of get right through into the margin fairly quickly, where in the past, we would have had more levers to work with internally to slow those things down. When we gave our guidance, we built it around the expectation that towards the end of the first quarter, these savings would be available to us to help offset those pressures. The timing has turned out to be a little slower than that. And so that's kind of a piece of how we got to where we are.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Lisa Gill (Analysts)】\nBut it sounds like these are transient, that rates -- once you're able to work towards this relationship starting more so -- if I remember correctly, it's around August 1, which is where more of this will happen, that this is really just a timing issue. Am I thinking about that correctly? And then I'll hop off.\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nYes. I think there is a very significant timing issue here involved. No question about it. I'm not sure we gave that date, August 1. So I'll not confirm that date. But what we have said is that the savings will build during the second quarter.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Judah Frommer (Analysts)】\nThis is actually Judah on for Ed. I wanted to touch a little more on the reimbursement pressure. How much of this do you think is related to generics coming in later than you expected? You mentioned kind of adjusting the timing for the roll-on of some big generics. Would we be talking as much about this if you had some of those big generics in there right now?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Vitrano (Executives)】\nYes. I mean, we originally thought that Nexium, we original anticipated Nexium was going to come in earlier in the year. And as we updated our guidance here in June, in our forecast, we pushed that out to not expect it to come until much later in the year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Judah Frommer (Analysts)】\nOkay. And the reimbursement pressure, how much would you say is specific to Rite Aid based on whether it's MAC contracts or other factors? And how much is just kind of general pricing pressure in the marketplace?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nThat's a question I cannot answer for you. We're certainly privy to what happens here, but I have no idea what other companies' contracts are, what they look like or how they work or the timing of renewals, that kind of thing.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Bryan Hunt (Analysts)】\nFirst question, I was wondering, when you look at a RediClinic remodel and are putting a RediClinic in a store versus an traditional Wellness remodel, what's the difference in cost of that relative remodel? And what type of lift in sales are you anticipating versus the lifts you're getting today of roughly 265 bps on the front-end and 120 on scripts?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nSo I guess, the answer to the question is we think RediClinic is going to provide not only revenue through the clinic, but additional script count as well, so it's -- we kind of -- we sort of get a pick-up in both spots. So in terms of a Wellness renovation, it would significantly help us on the comp side. In terms of cost associated with it...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Vitrano (Executives)】\nRight now, we're estimating about $200,000 to put a RediClinic in. And I would assume, Bryan, that we have to put a bathroom in as well.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Bryan Hunt (Analysts)】\nVery good. And next, more of a capital structure question. It sounds like you're going to pay off this 10.25% with cash and you'll generate plenty of free cash flow to manage that process. When you look at your capital structure going forward, I mean, you've got first lien debt, second lien debt, secured debt, and unsecured debt. I was wondering, can you give us maybe a little look into what your plan would be for, one, managing the level of leverage into kind what your optimal secured and unsecured capital structure would look like?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Vitrano (Executives)】\nYes. I mean, Bryan we -- we're always looking at the capital structure. And with regard to leverage here, we talked about, on prior calls, that we would like to get to a leverage ratio that has a three handle on it, and that's something that we're continuing to strive for. This year, we're forecasting to generate $400 million to $450 million of free cash flow that will help us to begin to pay down our debt here. And with regard to our capital structure, that's something that we continue to look at and to monitor on a long-term basis here. Obviously, we have seen some fairly significant improvement in our unsecured rates, which become more attractive, and that might be something that we would consider looking to access the unsecured market at some point in the future. But I think in the short-term, really looking at -- the opportunity that we have is really looking at the higher coupon indentures that we have and looking at the call premiums and see what's the appropriate time for us to refinance them.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Bryan Hunt (Analysts)】\nAnd my last question, as you approach that 3x leverage ratio, I mean, you made some small acquisitions of RediClinic and some other businesses and you're looking at script growth. Is there anything that would prevent you at all -- or do you feel more comfortable as leverage drops to maybe start to get into the storefront acquisition game? And what type of size, what -- I mean, would you consider end markets or would you talk about expanding markets, and that's it for me.\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nBoth. That's a Frank versus John discussion right there. Buy, buy. Oh, no.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Bryan Hunt (Analysts)】\nCan they battle it out on the call?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nWhat's that?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Bryan Hunt (Analysts)】\nI said, can they battle it out on the call?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nYes, we can definitely do that for you. No, we're -- I think we've said all along, we're very opportunistically-minded. We want to do the right things for our company and our business. And if there's something that makes sense to us, and it could be an existing market, maybe it could be outside an existing market, we'd take a hard look at it, so...\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Jones (Analysts)】\nSomewhat lost in the announcement from June 5 was the fact that same-store sales continued to improve. And in particular, same-store sales script seems to be accelerating month over month so far this year. Could you guys maybe talk a little bit about what's embedded in your full year same-store sales guidance as it relates to script growth? And I guess, just as a part of that, maybe any update on assumptions around what you're seeing or expect to see from exchange lives and Medicaid expansion?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Vitrano (Executives)】\nWell, in terms of same-store sales assumption, as I mentioned, we're looking to see 2.5% to 4.5% increases. We don't really provide any more specific color around specific script growth. However, we're clearly encouraged by the script growth, as well as the front-end trends that we're seeing here.\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nWhat was the second half of that? The Medicaid question.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Jones (Analysts)】\nWell, no -- I mean, just the -- as we've seen scripts improve, same-store scripts improve month-over-month, and looking at the full year total same-store sales, I'm just curious, as we've seen the script growth, is there anything that you're seeing today contributing directly from Medicaid expansion or exchange lives, and what's the assumption for the remainder of the year as it relates to script growth?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nOkay, sorry. So the first half of the question I think I can answer, which is in terms of what we've seen from the Affordable Care Act, it's fairly consistent with I think what we said in our last call, which is, in terms of exchange-based plans, probably 70% of the people that we can identify related to an exchange-based plan came from another plan where we already have them as a customer. So the net incremental piece of that was much smaller, and those people, those net incremental patients are -- haven't been huge utilizers yet. So the utilization, as a percentage of those plans, is probably less than the average. A little bit of a different story in the Medicaid. In the Medicaid expansion states, we've seen strong script growth, as Frank mentioned in his comments, particularly when you compare them to the non-Medicaid expansion states, where this isn't much growth. So it's clearly had an impact and it was a pretty strong contributor, we think, to the trends that you're seeing on our script count right now. As it relates to guidance right now, probably script count is in line with our expectations. I guess, that's probably the right way to say it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Jones (Analysts)】\nNo, that's fair. And then, I guess, just one follow up on the reimbursement pressures that you guys highlighted. I know your competitors have talked a lot about trying to insulate themselves away from these types of contracts that can change so abruptly. Any update on how you've been progressing in moving away from this type of contracting?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nYes, we work -- I think we worked hard over the last several years to move to fewer contracts where we don't have as much visibility into how rates will behave over time, but we do still have some left that we're working on. We're probably 60% or something that we're -- 60% to 70% of our managed care contracts are now more sort of guaranteed rate-type contracts. And I'll just emphasize one more time, we definitely have some volatility in the MAC-ing contracts. There's also some mix issues kind of rolling around in here as well.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Heinbockel (Analysts)】\nSo a couple of things. On reimbursement, how would you compare the volatility and what you saw this year to last year, the year before? Was there more this year, was it harder to judge it this year than past years?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nI'd say two things to that, John. In terms of the overall rate decline versus a year ago, if you looked at the first quarter last year versus the first quarter this year, the rate decline this year is less, which makes common sense because we don't have any significant LOEs or new generics or anything that are kind of coming around where there should be a significant rate decline. However, I would say that in terms of volatility or predictability, probably a little bit worse for us. We have some things going on I think this quarter that will probably be different than what we saw last quarter. And the last piece I would tell you is, last year, when we saw that, because we had a little bit more -- we had direct control over generic purchasing at that time, we were able to react in ways to help offset it, where right now, until we get this thing fully transitioned, we're a little stuck in the middle.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Heinbockel (Analysts)】\nWell, good. It sounds like that's -- the bigger piece is not that the plan design changed on you, it's that the midcourse corrections, you had no flexibility to do normal midcourse corrections that you might have -- that you did a year ago or before that, is that fair?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nSome of both, but both are important.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Heinbockel (Analysts)】\nBecause if that's true, the follow-up to that would be -- the 28% gross margin that is -- I don't want to say it's not realistic, but it's sort of not apples-to-apples because of your hamstringed ability to do direct buying yourself. Is that fair? And is there a catch-up? Or is that gross -- are those gross profit dollars lost? Or when you get this thing with McKesson ramped, some of that flows back in later quarters?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nSo I think what you said initially is correct in terms of there's definitely a piece of this that's related, specifically because we're kind of stuck in the middle here. Based on the way you see us adjusting our guidance, I think you can conclude that a piece of it, we think, is lost for the fiscal year. We don't get it back.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Heinbockel (Analysts)】\nNo, so I'd just -- I mean, you'll get a ramp in McKesson normally, but not -- there's not a catch-up -- there's not a bulky catch-up ever from this?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nThat's correct. I think we believe there was going to a transition period and there was going to be some costs associated with it. It was cost that was a little bit difficult to quantify and it's not an expense item on the P&L. It's coming through a lower margin rate. So -- but it just is more than we expected when we started this thing. But even considering kind of where we've come out here, when we look at the overall benefits of the relationship, still very, very strong believers that we're headed in the right direction even though we've got a little bit of painful period to work through to get there.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Heinbockel (Analysts)】\nAnd then the last one, you guys have never quantified -- I mean, you're not going to, but...\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\n[indiscernible].\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Heinbockel (Analysts)】\nWhat is the -- from what you sit today, is it the same as you thought 3 or 4 -- putting the transition period aside, is it more than you thought, the same, less than you thought, say 3 or 4 months ago?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nIn line with our expectations.\n\n---\n\n【質問: George Hill (Analysts)】\nFrank, on -- with respect to the plan changes and the plan mix, should we think of there being like a significant, I would call it, a prior period purchase adjustment, where you renegotiated payer plans somewhere, I would guess, between April 10 and June 5, it had to be retroactive to the quarter, that drove kind of a portion of the negative revision?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nYou made a bunch of leaps there that I wouldn't make. Yes, so we negotiate -- honestly, we have contracts negotiating all the time. So just for whatever that's worth, there's contract negotiations all the time. But I think what we sort of talked about is we have some contracts that are still MAC-based contracts that didn't behave well during the quarter. We have change in plan mix amongst plans in the quarter, so I'm not sure I follow the retroactive thing you said.\n\n---\n\n【質問: George Hill (Analysts)】\nYes. Well, I was just trying to -- look, I guess, what I'm trying to figure out is what changed between April 10, when you guys gave the guidance for the year, and June 5, when the revision was announced.\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nYes, so couple of things. We were hopeful, as we entered into the quarter and gave our guidance, that there were going to be some savings from our McKesson relationship that would help us manage some issues that were showing up in our numbers, more difficult reimbursement rates than we expected, some higher generic drug costs and, unfortunately, due to a number of different things, those savings are just showing up a little bit later than we expected. So we were not able to offset some of the things that were developing in the quarter in a way we thought was possible at the time we gave that guidance.\n\n---\n\n【質問: George Hill (Analysts)】\nOkay. And I guess, if we think about -- like the reimbursement perspective, we talked about plan-specific items. Is the right way to think about that -- would an example of that being ESI having written to their contracts that they get to determine what's a generic drug, what's a branded generic, what's a branded drug, and force that upon you. And that, like that's a term that you guys are trying to negotiate out of future contracts? I guess, I'm trying to understand examples of kind of what drove the negative reimbursement pressure.\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nSure. So I'll go back to kind of 2 basic examples. The first one will be around some -- a contract that where we saw more volatility than we expected. So we might have a contract where, on generic drugs, there is a proprietary MAC list that PBM uses. They don't often provide us their proprietary MAC list. And so they have flexibility to adjust generic drug costs as they go. So it's a little -- sometimes, we have a little bit of difficulty getting good insight as to how that's going to behave over time. And some of those contracts did behave well during the quarter, so that's one example of something that we saw related to generic purchasing or generic reimbursement rates. Another situation would be, we might have a contract with a PBM, where we're in 3 different plans: one is a very narrow plan, one is a medium plan and one is a broad plan. And we might see as we come through into the fiscal year, gradually, as there's utilization, that the PBM has migrated patients from the broad plan, which has the highest reimbursement rate, to either the middle plan or the lowest reimbursement rate plan. We call that a change in plan mix and we saw some of that activity as well. Those things tend to develop over time. When a plan change goes into effect January 1, you need utilization, you need time, you need claims to really see how these things are going to develop. Oftentimes, as we come through January and February, where we don't always have great insight as to where rates are really trending in the year because of so much activity between patients moving between PBMs and patients moving within plans inside of PBMs and the way PBMs are passing reimbursement rate back to us, quite honestly, that it takes a little while until you get real visibility into where you are. And so you've got to stir all that together and combine it with the fact that in the past, again, we would have probably been a little more active on the purchasing side in terms of driving some cost out to try and react to those things that we were unable to do in this particular time frame.\n\n---\n\n【質問: George Hill (Analysts)】\nJohn, that's very helpful. And then maybe just the last, a quick follow-up. Is the narrow network trend then on the PBM side negatively impacting you guys? And do you guys have the scale to participate and compete against PBMs that want to drop [ph] narrow pharmacy networks? And then I'll hop off.\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nYes, that's a great question. I do think the narrow network thing continues to build a little bit and I think we see it not only in our managed care plans, but also probably in Medicare Part D plans as well. And that gets right back to one of the important strategic reasons why we need to be very competitive on our drug cost, which is why we started down the road on this McKesson relationship to begin with. The combined purchasing power, we think, over the long term will make us a competitive provider of solid drug prescription delivery over the long term, which is really kind of where we're going with the McKesson relationship, that's why we're there.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Steven Valiquette (Analysts)】\nSo I guess, in this case, I apologize in advance for sort of a granular business mechanics question. But just to make sure I understand this. I guess, the discussion on the call suggests that, historically, if you start to get MAC-ed a little bit, it kind of implies you can quickly go to manufacturers and buy it cheaper to partially offset this. Obviously, you're saying that, temporarily, you can't do this under the McKesson transition. So I guess, 2 questions would be: one, did you lose some -- maybe some special relationships with generic manufacturers, and that's why you're a little bit handcuffed right now; but also, question number two, what will change, I guess, just mechanically with McKesson in the future that will allow you and McKesson, again, to quickly adapt to Rite Aid's specific reimbursement changes? I'm curious if some of the generic buying is specifically tied to MAC prices, but just any extra color around this would definitely be helpful.\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nYes, sure. So quickly is a relative term. I mean, you can't do it in days. But certainly, in weeks and months, you can. And again, probably the difference would be as we -- maybe as came through the first quarter, if we saw coming out the reimbursement rates were going to be tough, to the extent we had visibility to it, we would be active in the marketplace trying to figure out why that is, why is somebody MAC-ing us, is there a cost available in the marketplace to help us offset that, and we would be working that throughout the quarter. So it's not instantaneous, it isn't reimbursement rates are low today, we're going to call somebody and find a lower cost. So I don't want to necessarily imply that. But it is a bit of a hand-in-glove process that you have to work through to manage both sides of the equation to get everything to kind of work together, which right now, until we make a full transition here, is a little bit more difficult to do. So in terms of relationships with manufacturers, our team is working hard with McKesson to continue to build the valuable relationships that we've built over the years. And I think McKesson understands our business needs in terms of how we need to manage our business. And we're hopeful that as we work together with them as a team, we'll be able to achieve the savings over the long term that we need to manage our business. We -- how quickly we can move collectively as a team, those things will work out over time. But in the long run, we still believe strategically this is the right way to go.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Steven Valiquette (Analysts)】\nSo in the future, you'll just have to be more aggressive on communicating with them if you're getting MAC-ed, and then, hopefully, they can make the adjustments.\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nThat's correct. That's just going to be another [indiscernible]. That's correct.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Carla Casella (Analysts)】\nYou talked a bit about the working capital benefits from the new McKesson arrangement. Are you expecting working capital to be a source of cash for the year? Because it looks like payables came down with the inventory this quarter, causing less of a source than we would have expected.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Vitrano (Executives)】\nYes. I mean, in terms of -- we got about $100 million benefit from inventory. A piece of it -- the payable was really just a timing issue in terms from fourth quarter to first quarter here. But we do expect that we're going to get a net working capital benefit from the McKesson agreement, $150 million of which should come primarily out of the distribution centers. And then right now, we're expecting another $100 million-or-so that would come out of the stores.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kenneth Martindale (Executives)】\nAnd Carla, we haven't guided into details of any kind of impact this has on payables, but that $250 million is net of any payable impact.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Carla Casella (Analysts)】\nOkay, great. And then you've talked a lot about the Affordable Care Act, but how do you expect that to impact you on the cost side? How many of your employees are eligible?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nSo a couple of years ago, we really migrated our plans to a compliant structure. So we've absorbed those cost changes in our plans over the last couple of years. I don't think there's anything significant for this year. Like in 2018 or something, we'll have to make -- by 2018, we'll have to make some further plan changes to avoid excise taxes and that kind of stuff, but it's not significant this fiscal year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Carla Casella (Analysts)】\nOkay, great. And then if I can add one more. You talked about some of the new formats or new tests you're trying, the Fresh Day Café, enhanced beauty. How many stores are in the test for those and what's the time frame? When you find something that works, how long does it take to roll it out to all the Wellness Stores?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kenneth Martindale (Executives)】\nThat's a fairly complicated question. Some of these have application to all stores if they do well, and there are bits and pieces of some of these things that will roll out in all stores. Beauty is a good example. Over the last couple of years, we've fairly dramatically changed the way that we merchandise and we roll this -- the beauty departments out. There are some things that we're rolling out backwards into other Wellness Stores like our nail bars. We've gone backwards and put them into a bunch of stores because we saw they were very, very effective in growing that business. Other things like some of the new merchandising displays that we've got in Beverly Hills will be more on a go-forward basis on some of the higher potential stores. So it's really a mix. It depends on what the initiative is and what the cost is to get it implemented, so it's almost an initiative-by-initiative basis.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Karru Martinson (Analysts)】\nI realize this is significantly less relevant than it used to be, but just wanted to get a sense of the script file valuations. Are we still in the kind of the $10 to $20 range when we're out purchasing scripts?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Vitrano (Executives)】\nYes, I would say maybe it's inched up a little bit, Karru. So maybe it's $13 to $20 or something like that, but that's generally the range.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Karru Martinson (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then where are these file buys coming from? I mean, how much of the overall market kind of still remains local or mom-and-pop?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Vitrano (Executives)】\nIf you look at the stats, there's still about 10% of kind of the total doors that are out there that are independent. And we continue to send out fliers, knock on doors. And I guess for some of these smaller guys, they're continuing to see reimbursement rate pressure and whatnot and decide it's time to move on, do something different, or in some instances, come work for us.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Karru Martinson (Analysts)】\nAnd when you look at some of the more regional players or some of the alternate channels, grocery stores with pharmacies and so forth, I mean, as reimbursement rate pressure rises, do you see some of these guys getting out of the business? Is that an opportunity or is that just going to be -- continue to be part of their business?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Vitrano (Executives)】\nNo. I mean, we have seen some small chains, 3 or 4 or 5 store -- grocery stores that have decided to either close or get out of the business. Those have been some of the opportunities. And then there's been some Kmarts out there that are on the market. But generally, it's generally more the independents is who we're buying it from.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Karru Martinson (Analysts)】\nOkay. And just lastly, you guys mentioned increasing your smoking cessation program. If you could just remind us kind of what's the view right now in terms of tobacco sales within the chain?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kenneth Martindale (Executives)】\nWell, at this point, we've got a lot of our customers and patients that are currently buying tobacco products. And for whatever personal reason they have, they made that decision. And at this point, we think that we can probably deliver a great solution for those customers when they decide to quit smoking. One thing that we do know is the vast majority of tobacco users, at some point, make that decision and we think that we're uniquely positioned to deliver for those folks. So we're trying to develop a program that integrates all the resources that we have available to us to provide them with the most extensive support system that we possibly can. So we're looking forward to rolling that out in late summer, and we think it's going to be pretty exciting.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Karen Eltrich (Analysts)】\nA couple of questions. As you add these new departments and you add the medi clinics, what's coming out? Where -- how are you making room for these things and what are the categories that are kind of going to shrink?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kenneth Martindale (Executives)】\nWell, I think in general, it's probably consistent with what's been happening in the Wellness Stores. As we look to further build out the health care services that we're providing to our patients back in the pharmacy area, it does put pressure on the front-end. And typically, we're growing the footprint on the front-end in health and beauty, in vitamins and better-for-you foods and the things that support living a healthy lifestyle. And so it clearly puts pressure on some of the general merchandise categories and miscellaneous categories that don't as closely support that. So I think what you've seen in the Wellness Stores will probably continue as the evolution rolls forward.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Karen Eltrich (Analysts)】\nIs there a potential, with the medi clinics, to also provide dialysis services?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nNot with where we're heading with RediClinic.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Karen Eltrich (Analysts)】\nOkay, fair enough. And I'm sorry if I missed this. Did you say how many store closures we should expect this year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Vitrano (Executives)】\n40, Karen.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Karen Eltrich (Analysts)】\nGreat. And final question, I saw this ad TV and I thought it was an intriguing app. But GoodRx, which does pharmacy comparisons and coupons for prescriptions, and they did specifically list you guys as someone who is kind of a participant in this. Is this something that could have an impact on the industry?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nI'd have to look at that more carefully. Honestly, I'm not sure. So much of our business is insured. I just have to see what it does.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Matt Schroeder (Executives)】\nOkay. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. I appreciate it.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you, and welcome to this telephone conference on the occasion of H&M's 6-month results 2014. Jyrki Tervonen, our CFO, is with me today again, and we'll be happy to answer your questions after the presentation. You will find the presentation slides to this telephone conference on hm.com.\r\nPlease look at the slide, Second Quarter 2014. Our collections have been well received and we continue to gain market share in the second quarter. H&M Group sales were strong, increasing 16% in local currencies. Converted into SEK, the increase was 20% as a result of the weakened Swedish kronor against most sales markets currently [ph]. All group brands contributed to the positive sales development, H&M, COS, & Other Stories, Monki, Weekday and Cheap Monday, as well as H&M Home. We're also very pleased that our new H&M Sport, which we are developing further, continued taking market share in the sports segment.\r\nAnd before we move on, just a comment on current trading. Sales in June have started well, although there will be a negative calendar effect of 2 to 4 percentage points on the month as a whole. In May, we had a positive calendar effect of 2 to 4 percentage points, which will be reversed in June.\r\nGross profit in the second quarter increased 19% to SEK 23 billion, corresponding to a gross margin of 60.8% compared to 61.1% a year ago. Markdowns in relation to sales decreased marginally compared to Q2 2013. The overall market situation for external factors, such as cotton prices, the U.S. dollar and cost inflation, was slightly negative for sourcing to the Q2 compared to a year earlier, mainly as a result of wage increases in the sourcing markets.\r\nLooking at the sourcing period to the third quarter 2014, the market situation for the external factors is also considered to be slightly negative. Cost control in the H&M Group remains very good. In the second quarter, cost in comparable stores were unchanged compared to the same quarter last year in absolute terms and decreased as a share of sales. \r\nSG&A increased 16% to SEK 15.4 billion. In local currencies, the increase was 13%. The increase is mainly related to our expansion and our long-term investments in IT and online, but also in the broadening of the product range and establishment of the new fashion brand, & Other Stories.\r\nPlease turn to the slide, Long-term Investments. We see these investments as very important for H&M's future success. They cost a lot now, but will be very important for H&M for many years to come. The long-term investments are aimed at further strengthening H&M's market position in securing future expansion. Some of them are starting to generate revenue like & Other Stories and H&M's online store in the U.S. and France.\r\nFollowing H&M's online launch in the U.S. last autumn, we launched online shopping in France in the middle of March in this year and customer response has been very good. Long-term investments increased in the second quarter compared to the second quarter last year. In absolute terms, the cost increase in the second quarter was similar to the increase in the first quarter this year, but it did not have as big as the percentage impact on results as in Q1. This is because Q2 is a much larger quarter both in terms of sales and in terms of results.\r\nIn the second quarter, the cost increase for the long-term investments equaled around 50 basis points. Half of which affected cost of goods sold and half affected operating costs. The long-term investment will continue. In 2014, cost will be at a higher level than in 2013. During the year, costs may be divided unequally between the quarters.\r\nTo look at profitability in the quarter, please return to the slide, Second Quarter 2014. Operating profit increased by 26%, and the operating margin was 20% compared to 19% in the second quarter last year. Profit after financial items increased by 25% or SEK 1.5 billion to SEK 7.6 billion in the quarter. After a tax rate of 24%, net profit increased to SEK 5.8 billion, equaling earnings per share of SEK 3.51, up from SEK 2.81.\r\nAnd now, for some other key figures, please turn to the slide, Key Data. Stock-in-trade as of 31st of May amounted to SEK 14.9 billion, an increase of 18% in Swedish kronor and 16% in local currencies. The increase is mainly explained by the expansion in stores and online. The level and composition of the stock-in-trade is considered good. Cash flow from current operations was SEK 11.9 billion compared to SEK 11.2 billion a year ago. The main explanation is the strong results. Investments in terms of CapEx totaled SEK 3.9 billion. This reflects our store expansion but also continued investments in IT and logistics. The financial position of the group remains strong. Liquid funds amounted to SEK 9.6 billion, and return on equity was 50.5% rolling 12 months compared to 45% last year.\r\nAnd now, some words on our expansion. Please turn to the slide, Expansion. Our offering is reaching more and more customers, both through our stores and through e-commerce. In the second quarter, we opened 93 new stores net, and as of the 31st of May, we have 3,285 stores in 54 markets. One of our most exciting happenings in the quarter was the opening of the first H&M store in Australia, a flagship store in the best location in Melbourne, the landmark General Post Office building. We realized that there would be great in H&M in Australia, but we were still surprised at the enormous attention that the opening attracted. More than 3,000 customers queued for several hours and many had even spent the night outside the store to be sure of getting in first. We are looking forward to our continued expansion in Australia.\r\nAnd looking ahead, the global expansion of the H&M group continues. For 2014, we maintain our plan to open around 375 stores net within our expansion target of increasing the number stores by 10% to 15% per year. China and the U.S. are expected to remain the largest expansion markets. In just a few years, China has grown to become one of our largest markets with over 240 stores to date compared to 150 stores just a year ago. We also see room for continued expansion in other existing markets, as well as in new markets. Two new countries will be added in total this year. Following the opening in Australia, the Philippines and India will become new markets for H&M in the second half of the year. And next year, we will expand to Peru and South Africa.\r\nPlease turn to the next slide. Expansion continues also for the newer brands, COS, & Other Stories, Monki, Weekday and Cheap Monday, as well as H&M Home.\r\nPlease turn to the slide, H&M online. In order to carry-through our multi-channel strategy, we will continue our long-term investments with the expansion of H&M's online store in more countries. We're currently preparing to open H&M's online store in Spain and Italy early this autumn, and later this year, we will launch H&M shop online in China. So, in total, we're adding online shopping in 4 large H&M markets this year. And looking ahead, the global rollout will continue next year. In 2015, we plan to add between 8 and 10 new H&M online markets. We're also continuing to broaden our offering within H&M.\r\nPlease turn to the next slide. Already this autumn, H&M will launch an extended and improved shoe range for women, men, teenagers and children. The extended collection will be available in selected stores in 9 markets, including China, the U.S., U.K., in Sweden, as well as online at hm.com. The new shoe concept will offer a variety of styles in different price categories, but as always, at H&M prices. This new extended shoe offering is part of our long-term investments.\r\nWe also have a very interesting designer collaboration coming up at H&M this autumn with the U.S. designer, Alexander Wang. Alexander Wang is based in New York, where he started his fashion label in 2007. And today, he's one of the most important voices in fashion. Wang is the first American designer who teams up with H&M. His tailoring is fashion-forward with a sporty look. The collection, Alexander Wang and H&M, will feature apparel and accessories for women and men. It will be available from the 6th of November in around 250 H&M stores around the world and online at hm.com.\r\nAnd with that, we are now happy to take your questions. [Operator Instructions]",

We are looking forward to our continued expansion in Australia.\r\nAnd looking ahead, the global expansion of the H&M group continues. For 2014, we maintain our plan to open around 375 stores net within our expansion target of increasing the number stores by 10% to 15% per year. China and the U.S. are expected to remain the largest expansion markets. In just a few years, China has grown to become one of our largest markets with over 240 stores to date compared to 150 stores just a year ago. We also see room for continued expansion in other existing markets, as well as in new markets. Two new countries will be added in total this year. Following the opening in Australia, the Philippines and India will become new markets for H&M in the second half of the year. And next year, we will expand to Peru and South Africa.\r\nPlease turn to the next slide. Expansion continues also for the newer brands, COS, & Other Stories, Monki, Weekday and Cheap Monday, as well as H&M Home.\r\nPlease turn to the slide, H&M online. In order to carry-through our multi-channel strategy, we will continue our long-term investments with the expansion of H&M's online store in more countries. We're currently preparing to open H&M's online store in Spain and Italy early this autumn, and later this year, we will launch H&M shop online in China. So, in total, we're adding online shopping in 4 large H&M markets this year. And looking ahead, the global rollout will continue next year. In 2015, we plan to add between 8 and 10 new H&M online markets. We're also continuing to broaden our offering within H&M.\r\nPlease turn to the next slide. Already this autumn, H&M will launch an extended and improved shoe range for women, men, teenagers and children. The extended collection will be available in selected stores in 9 markets, including China, the U.S., U.K., in Sweden, as well as online at hm.com. The new shoe concept will offer a variety of styles in different price categories, but as always, at H&M prices. This new extended shoe offering is part of our long-term investments.\r\nWe also have a very interesting designer collaboration coming up at H&M this autumn with the U.S. designer, Alexander Wang. Alexander Wang is based in New York, where he started his fashion label in 2007. And today, he's one of the most important voices in fashion. Wang is the first American designer who teams up with H&M. His tailoring is fashion-forward with a sporty look. The collection, Alexander Wang and H&M, will feature apparel and accessories for women and men. It will be available from the 6th of November in around 250 H&M stores around the world and online at hm.com.\r\nAnd with that, we are now happy to take your questions. [Operator Instructions]",
      "transcript_text3": "Rebecca McClellan from Santander. Just a couple of questions, please. Firstly, can you confirm your CapEx project for the full year, please?\n\n---\n\nYes, at this moment, the best estimate still remains that it will end up in SEK 9 billion to SEK 9.5 billion for the whole year.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And my second question, the incremental longer-term investment cost is still going to be between SEK 600 million and SEK 800 million, is that right?\n\n---\n\nThat's right. That's correct.\n\n---\n\nFirst question was just on, why have markdowns decreased marginally when the sales were so strong? I just wondered if there have been any change in the commercial strategy over the quarter? And then secondly, can you talk about any improvements you're making to your delivery offer online? And in particular, any plans to introduce click and collect?\n\n---\n\nYes, the first question, markdown levels, I think when we're talking about the markdown levels, we also have to -- to always not to have always a correlation. Good turnover doesn't have to mean always that the markdown levels fell down, because it's always on different markets, a question of salesmanship. We are always reacting on what's happening on the market and we are pretty happy with the markdown levels we have. And I think also the most important thing is that we have a good customer offering. And then that we work with the markdown, so also, it's a tactical tool on each market. So -- and this quarter, we ended up that they were more or less 20 basis points -- having 20 basis points less negative impact on gross margin compared to last year.\n\n---\n\nAnd regarding your second question, I think it was about free delivery and click and collect, is that right?\n\n---\n\nThat's right, yes.\n\n---\n\nRight. Again, this is -- when it comes to e-commerce, it's -- we think it's important to talk about the total offering. So it's about the fashion, quality, price and of course, lead times, et cetera. And I mean, we do offer free delivery sometimes in campaigns, et cetera, but it's not a standard thing. And we also think it's important to say that free delivery mean someone has to pay for it, either it's the customer in terms of you're putting the price and it's a higher price or it's the investor who, at the end of the day, perhaps don't get any returns on his investment. But -- so I think it's, in many cases, we charge for delivery and that's straightforward. But again, it's the total offering that's important. When it comes to click and collect and lot of other features, of course, we'll look into that. But at the moment, we don't offer click and collect.\n\n---\n\nI wanted to ask about China. As you say, it's your most important expansion market. Sales there are growing very strongly, but not as strongly as the store count. Can you confirm, firstly, that the like-for-like stores are still growing sales. And secondly, can you talk about the dynamics as to why the total revenue base is not growing as quickly as the store count? Is it square meters and not as fast as store numbers? Or is it you're going into less productive space in perhaps cheaper locations?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think we've touched upon this question many times before. And first of all, we explain very quickly, we can't just look at the numbers. Because none of the stores that you see in the -- have just opened and there is still not so much revenues in the numbers. And secondly, of course, we started initially in the largest cities like Hong Kong and Shanghai, and then we have, step-by-step, moved into second tiers, third tiers, fourth tiers, et cetera. So it's a combination of many factors. But sales are strong and developing very well.\n\n---\n\nAnd then also, yes, to your question about the like-for-like development. So we are happy with the like-for-like development in China. It's developing in a good rate.\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nAnd if I can attempt some insight on your group-level for like-for-like. I appreciate you don't disclose those in absolute terms anymore. But has the contribution from new space and new online stores accelerated versus the first quarter? Or can we interpret that your constant FX acceleration in Q2 as being mainly about like-for-like?\n\n---\n\nIt's -- I mean, the store contribution -- space contribution is more or less the same levels as last year.\n\n---\n\nCould you just talk about a bit about the shoe collection? I mean, you already offer shoes across the range. So what's different about this relaunched category?\n\n---\n\nIt's a big investment even though it's not as big as the sport. But it's about broadening the range, and there's a lot of product development. So for example, in comfort and materials, et cetera. And there's a greater variety of product with many different types of models.\n\n---\n\nAnd would we expect then that there will be a broader price range on these shoes to accompany the...\n\n---\n\nThat's right.\n\n---\n\nAnd is it similar to what you've been doing in other parts of the offer of kind of generally broadening the offer and, obviously in some cases, increasing price points along with a set of the premium lines?\n\n---\n\nYes, but this is specifically on shoes. And we are -- as you said, we are -- we will have a wider price range and a lot wider collection so to speak. And initially, as I've said before, it's going to be in selected 9 countries and run 30 selected stores. And they will be displayed in clear areas, in menswear, in ladieswear, children, et cetera.\n\n---\n\nYes, and also that even though we are spreading the price range, it's still very, very good value for money.\n\n---\n\nSure. And just in terms of the China launch, I mean I know you've given us a considerable degree of disclosure about kind of one-off for development costs through the course of this year. But is China in itself, with the e-comm launch, going to be a kind of significantly lumpy element that we'd actually see in the P&L? Or is it just part and parcel?\n\n---\n\nIt's part of the parcel, I would say.\n\n---\n\nAnd it's all being done in-house? Or are you going to be using any third parties in terms of distribution or websites or anything like that?\n\n---\n\nWhen it comes to distribution, we will be working with third parties, but the rest of it will be in-house.\n\n---\n\nSo 2 questions for me, one at a time. So first question on your online launches. It seems that you have -- you accelerate now the amount of countries that you are launching on. Do you leverage existing infrastructure? Or is there some incremental investments associated with these launches that are worth mentioning?\n\n---\n\nOf course, we are capitalizing on existing infrastructure and the IT systems over there, but for each country, there's a lot of additional work to be done. We have to adapt. There's a lot of different payment systems, cards, et cetera, and also logistics. But we are ramping up a number of new countries, but in terms of sales, we already cover maybe 60%, 70% of the group revenues.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Okay, that's helpful. And the other question, on a big pickup in the admin expenses. And I know it's not a big part of your costs, but they did grow more than double what your stores grew. Any color there that you could give?\n\n---\n\nYes, it's mostly related to the long-term investments, of course. And as we said, it's more or less in the same range, the amount that's in Q1. And half of it is on cost of goods sold, and the remaining part is in the operating expenses, and also most of them may be in the admin expenses. So that's main reason to the bump up in admin.\n\n---\n\nOkay, that's perfect. And if I may, if I -- on your COS stores, because you mentioned that you will open more stores this year than last year. But you've just opened 9 stores, and now should we expect an acceleration of store openings for COS in the second half?\n\n---\n\nLook, it's more -- we're going to open more in the second half than the first half for COS, yes.\n\n---\n\nIt's Anne Critchlow from SG. My first question is about & Other Stories. You say in the statement that's now generating revenue, but I guess it's been generating revenue for some time ever since you opened the doors of the first store. Did you mean EBIT, they're making a contribution to profit?\n\n---\n\nNo, it was more -- it, of course, we are -- generating nice revenues increase.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And is it making a positive contribution to profit now?\n\n---\n\nWe don't comment on positivity per cons and pros. We are happy with the development, absolutely.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Then the second question concerns your southern hemisphere sales. You've got quite a few areas now. So I'm wondering if your experience of what sells there is helping you to -- is helping inform you of trends that might sell in Europe 6 months later?\n\n---\n\nI don't think it's that simple. But of course, having both online and sales in the southern hemisphere helps us to get a better picture of how fashion moves and changes, absolutely.\n\n---\n\nIt's Jamie Merriman from Bernstein. My question is about the sustainability initiatives that you've been working on and some of your comments about rising manufacturing wages that you're seeing in Asia. Can you give us some indication about the level at which you're experiencing that increase and also just philosophically, as your view that customers are understanding of that and willing to pay a bit more for a product that's more sustainable?\n\n---\n\nYes, I'm glad you noticed that, for us, sustainability is very, very important. We take this very seriously. But when it comes to salaries, one example is, of course, in Bangladesh, where minimum salaries were up 78% as of 1st of December. And of course, this is reflected in the cost, that's what we say with increased salaries, cost inflation among the suppliers. And of course, that's part of -- we have to pay that. But we also see positive things coming out of it. We see that in the long term, it leads to better stability and better quality and less unrest, so it's a very good thing. First of all, of course, sustainability is good for the people and the environment. So there was a salary -- what was the second questions, please?\n\n---\n\nIt was just about, are you seeing indications from customers that they understand your work on sustainability and are willing to absorb some of that cost?\n\n---\n\nYes. We see, definitely, that this is not a short term. This is something that's becoming more and more important, and we see that more and more customers are asking for it. We also see that our -- when we look for employees, they want to work with a good company, so it's very important to have such in that perspective as well. And also for us to work within the company, I mean, we want to be proud of what we do and I'm very proud of what my colleagues in the company does. And just to add one more thing, when it comes to these increased cost for this some -- the suppliers, we don't -- we've decided not to pass that on to the consumers. That's part of the reflection in the -- that's reflected in the gross margin.\n\n---\n\nCan you please comment on the H&M Sport collection, how it's been -- how well it's been received and how many stores it's being expanded into? And then any updates on raw material prices, cost inflation in currency, and the outlook for their impact on the gross margin?\n\n---\n\nOne question at a time. First question Sports had been very well-received, we're very happy. And so far, we have the extended range in around 50 stores. And we have a number of stores with the Sport and, generally, a number of stores, around 2,000 stores with Ladies Sports, et cetera. And we have now decided to expand this going further as a result of the very good reception. Your second question was about trying to quantify the increased cost in -- it's very difficult for us to quantify it. So that's why we say it's increasing, but it's difficult to quantify.\n\n---\n\nJust when you mentioned the long-term incremental investments for this year, should we expect that going forward also?\n\n---\n\nFor this year, we have quantified it around SEK 600 million to SEK 800 million. Regarding next year, they will continue. But we will have to come back about the level, whether it's going to be increasing it further or decrease, but let's come back to that later on.\n\n---\n\nA question on online, please. In your big existing online markets, what proportion of the overall H&M range is actually available online for markets like U.K., U.S., Germany? And how quickly do you expect to close that gap as it were?\n\n---\n\nWe are, in many countries, actually, we have -- we offer most products both online and offline, but I don't think the target is to be 100. Some products will be available only online and some products only offline. So this is a case-by-case. But it's -- you could say that most products now are available in both channels.\n\n---\n\nAnd the second, very anoraky [ph] one. How big is the store in Melbourne?\n\n---\n\nIt's around 5,000 square meters.\n\n---\n\nJust going back to your comments on supply chain and sustainability and minimum wage increases. Just looking at it from the customers' perspective. What do your surveys show about whether people actually care about it and whether they're changing their shopping habits? I'm just trying to gauge whether we're right at the start of you getting benefit from it or you're already seeing that come through in shopping habits?\n\n---\n\nYes, more and more people are asking for it, and it's becoming more and more important, and of course, we want to be proactive.\n\n---\n\nThat's showing up in all your survey work?\n\n---\n\nAbsolutely.\n\n---\n\nYes, yes, okay. And a second question on footwear. Again, what's the opportunity there? I mean, footwear, presumably as a percentage of sales, currently is miniscule. Is that -- would that be the right word?\n\n---\n\nWe wouldn't invest in shoes if we didn't see a very interesting potential.\n\n---\n\nSo as a percentage of sales currently, are we talking about, what, just 1% or 2%?\n\n---\n\nI'll let you guys do that kind of guessing. We don't disclose the different parts, sorry.\n\n---\n\nAnd perhaps, just one last one. I know that -- following on from Anne's question about & Other Stories. I mean, you said that all the other non-H&M brands contributed. What did you mean by that? Did you mean that, altogether, those non-H&M brands saw profit growth?\n\n---\n\nNo, I said that when we talk about revenue increase, then they all contributed to the revenue increase.\n\n---\n\nThe revenue, okay. I should hope so on that. But no comment on non-H&M profitability, just all combined?\n\n---\n\nI'm terribly sorry. No.\n\n---\n\n[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Fraser Ramzan.\n\n---\n\nIt's Fraser Ramzan at Nomura. Actually, it was just a point of clarification. I think I have a very bad phone line and, therefore, missed something. Did you indicate you had 16% to 17% of revenue online in answer to Chris' question?\n\n---\n\nNo, we don't disclose how much we sell online. Must have been a confusion somewhere. What was the question I answered?\n\n---\n\nOkay, so you give no indication. And you also indicated you had to absorb a minimum wage increase in Bangladesh. What was the number?\n\n---\n\nThe minimum salary increase was 78% in Bangladesh.\n\n---\n\n78%.\n\n---\n\nRebecca McClellan at Santander again. If you adjust the gross margin in the second quarter for the markdown and for the longer-term investment, it looks like the external factor contribution was down 25 bps. Is that what you're thinking for the third quarter as well?\n\n---\n\nAgain, the -- yes, what the gross margin becomes is, of course, at the end of the day, our -- what we do with the offering, with the markup and then the fabrics and whatever, there are lots of different factors that affect the gross margin. But we see that -- we say that the external factors are more or less at the same level for -- as we see it for Q3 as Q2.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Just another question, in fact, has there been any change in the average selling price of the spring, summer versus the previous season?\n\n---\n\nWhen it comes to pricing, we -- for competitive reasons, we choose not to comment on our pricing, sorry.\n\n---\n\nI was just wondering if you could put a little bit of color on your performance or experience at the U.S. market. Recently, there's been a lot of discussion about how value-based propositions are taking share at the expense of some of the incumbent brands in that space. Are you able to give us a few lines of how you're finding that market right now?\n\n---\n\nThe U.S. is, as always, very highly competitive, but we are doing well, and we increased sales with 22% in the quarter. And of course, we're very happy, especially, with our online growth.\n\n---\n\nAnd are you seeing it -- I mean I presume it's, by default, because of the rates of growth you're achieving, you're taking share, albeit off a relatively low base in the market. Is there anything to suggest that, I don't know if it's that term, it's kind of a structural shift in spending habits in that market at all?\n\n---\n\nI think it's very difficult for us to see that. But as we said, we're still a very small player in the U.S. market even though we are known [ph] nationwide and we have 313 stores and we're expanding quickly. And we continue to take market share and we continue to see a great potential for H&M. I think the U.S. shoppers have taken H&M to their hearts and they appreciate fashion quality at the best price.\n\n---\n\nNils, one more question for you. You mentioned that costs will be higher in 2014, I wanted to clarify. is that mainly because of stores or did you mean there is incremental cost investment beyond previous guidance of the 600 to 800, just to clarify that?\n\n---\n\nSorry, what costs?\n\n---\n\nYou mentioned in the beginning of the call that the costs in 2014 will be higher than in 2013. Now that's natural to assume given that you have store growth, but I wanted to clarify if you meant that cost investments will be higher in 2014 rather than...\n\n---\n\nThe long-term investments, they will be approx [ph] SEK 600 million to SEK 800 million. Higher 2014 compared to the 2013.\n\n---\n\nExactly the same message like in Q1.\n\n---\n\nSorry, I wanted to ask about your thoughts on the external factors for the gross margin in the fourth quarter. I know it's a little bit further off, but given the recent decline in the cost and price, I wondered whether you see any sort of lagged effect perhaps trickling through from then on or whether the wage pressures will continue to result in sort of net negative?\n\n---\n\nWell, we definitely see that the wage pressure will continue as you said. I mean there are lots of different factors and we're still buying for Q4. But all in all, I would say, pretty much the same picture as for Q3, which is negative.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Thank you, all, very much for participating in this conference call. We wish you all a great summer. And for those of you in the Southern Hemisphere, we wish you a great winter. And we'll come back for the 9 months result on the 25th of September.",

But we are ramping up a number of new countries, but in terms of sales, we already cover maybe 60%, 70% of the group revenues.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chris Chaviaras (Analysts)】\nOkay. Okay, that's helpful. And the other question, on a big pickup in the admin expenses. And I know it's not a big part of your costs, but they did grow more than double what your stores grew. Any color there that you could give?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nYes, it's mostly related to the long-term investments, of course. And as we said, it's more or less in the same range, the amount that's in Q1. And half of it is on cost of goods sold, and the remaining part is in the operating expenses, and also most of them may be in the admin expenses. So that's main reason to the bump up in admin.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chris Chaviaras (Analysts)】\nOkay, that's perfect. And if I may, if I -- on your COS stores, because you mentioned that you will open more stores this year than last year. But you've just opened 9 stores, and now should we expect an acceleration of store openings for COS in the second half?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nLook, it's more -- we're going to open more in the second half than the first half for COS, yes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Anne Critchlow (Analysts)】\nIt's Anne Critchlow from SG. My first question is about & Other Stories. You say in the statement that's now generating revenue, but I guess it's been generating revenue for some time ever since you opened the doors of the first store. Did you mean EBIT, they're making a contribution to profit?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nNo, it was more -- it, of course, we are -- generating nice revenues increase.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Anne Critchlow (Analysts)】\nOkay. And is it making a positive contribution to profit now?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nWe don't comment on positivity per cons and pros. We are happy with the development, absolutely.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Anne Critchlow (Analysts)】\nOkay. Then the second question concerns your southern hemisphere sales. You've got quite a few areas now. So I'm wondering if your experience of what sells there is helping you to -- is helping inform you of trends that might sell in Europe 6 months later?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nI don't think it's that simple. But of course, having both online and sales in the southern hemisphere helps us to get a better picture of how fashion moves and changes, absolutely.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jamie Merriman (Analysts)】\nIt's Jamie Merriman from Bernstein. My question is about the sustainability initiatives that you've been working on and some of your comments about rising manufacturing wages that you're seeing in Asia. Can you give us some indication about the level at which you're experiencing that increase and also just philosophically, as your view that customers are understanding of that and willing to pay a bit more for a product that's more sustainable?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nYes, I'm glad you noticed that, for us, sustainability is very, very important. We take this very seriously. But when it comes to salaries, one example is, of course, in Bangladesh, where minimum salaries were up 78% as of 1st of December. And of course, this is reflected in the cost, that's what we say with increased salaries, cost inflation among the suppliers. And of course, that's part of -- we have to pay that. But we also see positive things coming out of it. We see that in the long term, it leads to better stability and better quality and less unrest, so it's a very good thing. First of all, of course, sustainability is good for the people and the environment. So there was a salary -- what was the second questions, please?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jamie Merriman (Analysts)】\nIt was just about, are you seeing indications from customers that they understand your work on sustainability and are willing to absorb some of that cost?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nYes. We see, definitely, that this is not a short term. This is something that's becoming more and more important, and we see that more and more customers are asking for it. We also see that our -- when we look for employees, they want to work with a good company, so it's very important to have such in that perspective as well. And also for us to work within the company, I mean, we want to be proud of what we do and I'm very proud of what my colleagues in the company does. And just to add one more thing, when it comes to these increased cost for this some -- the suppliers, we don't -- we've decided not to pass that on to the consumers. That's part of the reflection in the -- that's reflected in the gross margin.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Dana Telsey (Analysts)】\nCan you please comment on the H&M Sport collection, how it's been -- how well it's been received and how many stores it's being expanded into? And then any updates on raw material prices, cost inflation in currency, and the outlook for their impact on the gross margin?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nOne question at a time. First question Sports had been very well-received, we're very happy. And so far, we have the extended range in around 50 stores. And we have a number of stores with the Sport and, generally, a number of stores, around 2,000 stores with Ladies Sports, et cetera. And we have now decided to expand this going further as a result of the very good reception. Your second question was about trying to quantify the increased cost in -- it's very difficult for us to quantify it. So that's why we say it's increasing, but it's difficult to quantify.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Dana Telsey (Analysts)】\nJust when you mentioned the long-term incremental investments for this year, should we expect that going forward also?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nFor this year, we have quantified it around SEK 600 million to SEK 800 million. Regarding next year, they will continue. But we will have to come back about the level, whether it's going to be increasing it further or decrease, but let's come back to that later on.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Geoff Lowery (Analysts)】\nA question on online, please. In your big existing online markets, what proportion of the overall H&M range is actually available online for markets like U.K., U.S., Germany? And how quickly do you expect to close that gap as it were?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nWe are, in many countries, actually, we have -- we offer most products both online and offline, but I don't think the target is to be 100. Some products will be available only online and some products only offline. So this is a case-by-case. But it's -- you could say that most products now are available in both channels.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Geoff Lowery (Analysts)】\nAnd the second, very anoraky [ph] one. How big is the store in Melbourne?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nIt's around 5,000 square meters.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Hughes (Analysts)】\nJust going back to your comments on supply chain and sustainability and minimum wage increases. Just looking at it from the customers' perspective. What do your surveys show about whether people actually care about it and whether they're changing their shopping habits? I'm just trying to gauge whether we're right at the start of you getting benefit from it or you're already seeing that come through in shopping habits?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nYes, more and more people are asking for it, and it's becoming more and more important, and of course, we want to be proactive.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Hughes (Analysts)】\nThat's showing up in all your survey work?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nAbsolutely.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Hughes (Analysts)】\nYes, yes, okay. And a second question on footwear. Again, what's the opportunity there? I mean, footwear, presumably as a percentage of sales, currently is miniscule. Is that -- would that be the right word?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nWe wouldn't invest in shoes if we didn't see a very interesting potential.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Hughes (Analysts)】\nSo as a percentage of sales currently, are we talking about, what, just 1% or 2%?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nI'll let you guys do that kind of guessing. We don't disclose the different parts, sorry.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Hughes (Analysts)】\nAnd perhaps, just one last one. I know that -- following on from Anne's question about & Other Stories. I mean, you said that all the other non-H&M brands contributed. What did you mean by that? Did you mean that, altogether, those non-H&M brands saw profit growth?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nNo, I said that when we talk about revenue increase, then they all contributed to the revenue increase.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Hughes (Analysts)】\nThe revenue, okay. I should hope so on that. But no comment on non-H&M profitability, just all combined?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nI'm terribly sorry. No.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Hughes (Analysts)】\n[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Fraser Ramzan.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Fraser Ramzan (Analysts)】\nIt's Fraser Ramzan at Nomura. Actually, it was just a point of clarification. I think I have a very bad phone line and, therefore, missed something. Did you indicate you had 16% to 17% of revenue online in answer to Chris' question?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nNo, we don't disclose how much we sell online. Must have been a confusion somewhere. What was the question I answered?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Fraser Ramzan (Analysts)】\nOkay, so you give no indication. And you also indicated you had to absorb a minimum wage increase in Bangladesh. What was the number?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nThe minimum salary increase was 78% in Bangladesh.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Fraser Ramzan (Analysts)】\n78%.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rebecca McClellan (Analysts)】\nRebecca McClellan at Santander again. If you adjust the gross margin in the second quarter for the markdown and for the longer-term investment, it looks like the external factor contribution was down 25 bps. Is that what you're thinking for the third quarter as well?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nAgain, the -- yes, what the gross margin becomes is, of course, at the end of the day, our -- what we do with the offering, with the markup and then the fabrics and whatever, there are lots of different factors that affect the gross margin. But we see that -- we say that the external factors are more or less at the same level for -- as we see it for Q3 as Q2.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rebecca McClellan (Analysts)】\nOkay. Just another question, in fact, has there been any change in the average selling price of the spring, summer versus the previous season?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nWhen it comes to pricing, we -- for competitive reasons, we choose not to comment on our pricing, sorry.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Rossington (Analysts)】\nI was just wondering if you could put a little bit of color on your performance or experience at the U.S. market. Recently, there's been a lot of discussion about how value-based propositions are taking share at the expense of some of the incumbent brands in that space. Are you able to give us a few lines of how you're finding that market right now?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nThe U.S. is, as always, very highly competitive, but we are doing well, and we increased sales with 22% in the quarter. And of course, we're very happy, especially, with our online growth.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Rossington (Analysts)】\nAnd are you seeing it -- I mean I presume it's, by default, because of the rates of growth you're achieving, you're taking share, albeit off a relatively low base in the market. Is there anything to suggest that, I don't know if it's that term, it's kind of a structural shift in spending habits in that market at all?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nI think it's very difficult for us to see that. But as we said, we're still a very small player in the U.S. market even though we are known [ph] nationwide and we have 313 stores and we're expanding quickly. And we continue to take market share and we continue to see a great potential for H&M. I think the U.S. shoppers have taken H&M to their hearts and they appreciate fashion quality at the best price.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chris Chaviaras (Analysts)】\nNils, one more question for you. You mentioned that costs will be higher in 2014, I wanted to clarify. is that mainly because of stores or did you mean there is incremental cost investment beyond previous guidance of the 600 to 800, just to clarify that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nSorry, what costs?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chris Chaviaras (Analysts)】\nYou mentioned in the beginning of the call that the costs in 2014 will be higher than in 2013. Now that's natural to assume given that you have store growth, but I wanted to clarify if you meant that cost investments will be higher in 2014 rather than...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nThe long-term investments, they will be approx [ph] SEK 600 million to SEK 800 million. Higher 2014 compared to the 2013.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nExactly the same message like in Q1.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charlie Muir-Sands (Analysts)】\nSorry, I wanted to ask about your thoughts on the external factors for the gross margin in the fourth quarter. I know it's a little bit further off, but given the recent decline in the cost and price, I wondered whether you see any sort of lagged effect perhaps trickling through from then on or whether the wage pressures will continue to result in sort of net negative?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nWell, we definitely see that the wage pressure will continue as you said. I mean there are lots of different factors and we're still buying for Q4. But all in all, I would say, pretty much the same picture as for Q3, which is negative.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nOkay. Thank you, all, very much for participating in this conference call. We wish you all a great summer. And for those of you in the Southern Hemisphere, we wish you a great winter. And we'll come back for the 9 months result on the 25th of September.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. This morning, we reported our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2015. And we are pleased with the solid growth in sales and earnings, given the challenging weather, conditions experienced across Canada this past winter and early spring. \r\nI will briefly go over the sales and store expansion highlights for the first quarter before turning it over to Michael, who will provide you with a more detailed update on our financial results and key operating initiatives.\r\nIn this quarter, our sales increased by 11.8%, primarily driven by the expansion of the store network and continued organic sales growth. During the quarter, we opened 25 net new stores compared with 21 net new stores opened in Q1 last year. Our total store count across Canada is now 899 stores compared with 806 stores as of May 5, 2013. For fiscal 2015, we still expect to open between 70 and 80 net new stores with most of those stores located in Ontario and Western Canada, which are markets that continue to be under-penetrated with dollar stores. \r\nIn this quarter, we also achieved a 3.3% increase in same-store sales through an increase in the average basket size while the number of transactions were slightly down, a decrease primarily attributable to the poor weather conditions in February and March.\r\nFrom a merchandising point of view, our Easter sales were very good and the customers responded positively to our merchandise mix. Our focus now is on our summer season, which was delayed by the colder weather conditions this spring. Sales of summer seasonable items are now accelerating as the weather is warming up.\r\nI would like to welcome, at this point, Johanne Choinière to the Dollarama management team. Johanne joined us as Chief Operating Officer effective May 12. She brings with her a wealth of leadership experience in the retail business, and she's already very involved in the day-to-day operations. I am confident that Johanne will contribute on -- to the ongoing growth and development of our business.\r\nMichael, over to you.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Larry, and good afternoon everyone. So during the first quarter, we increased our sales by 11.8% to $501.1 million from $448.1 million prior year. As Larry mentioned, the increase in sales was fueled by the opening of 93 net new stores over the past 12 months and a same-store sales increase of 3.3%. The higher same-store sales consisted of a 3.7% increase in basket size, which reflects the consumer demand for a higher price point items, partially offset by a 0.4% decrease in the number of transactions, primarily attributable to the adverse impact of the challenging weather conditions on store traffic.\r\nIn this quarter, 62% of our sales originated from products priced higher than $1 compared to 58% in the corresponding quarter last year. Debit card penetration also increased as 42% of sales were paid with debit cards compared to 40% in the corresponding period of previous fiscal year.\r\nIn the first quarter, our gross margin was 35.4% of sales compared to 35.9% of sales in Q1 last year. This decrease is mainly attributable to slightly lower product margins as we absorbed some of the cost increases in order to maintain the compelling value of our product offering, as well as to higher utility costs in stores during the colder-than-usual winter and spring seasons.\r\nAs we stated earlier this year, we have been managing our gross margin by continually reinvesting in the value proposition offered to consumers. We expect this trend to continue as we target a gross margin for the full fiscal year 2015 in the range of 36% to 37%, in order to stimulate continuous sales growth.\r\nOur Q1 SG&A as a percentage of sale was 18.2% compared to 18.8% last year. This progression is the result of the improved labor productivity achieved through initiatives implemented at the store level. \r\nIt should be noted that effective June 1, 2014, the Province of Ontario implemented a 7.3% minimum wage increase that, going forward in fiscal 2015, will create some headwinds against our productivity initiative gains. Overall, we still expect a slight improvement in the G&A ratio for the full fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. In Q1, our EBITDA grew 13% to $86.2 million or 17.2% of sales. \r\nOur depreciation and amortization expense decreased by $2.4 million this quarter due partially to a change in the estimated useful life of our leasehold improvements and store and warehouse equipment. IFRS requires a review, at least annually, of the residual value and useful life of fixed assets subject to depreciation. As a result of the review of leasehold improvements and store and warehouse equipment effective February 3, 2014, we increased the estimated useful lives of substantially all of the leasehold improvements and store and warehouse equipment. \r\nLeasehold improvements are now depreciated on a straight-line basis over a period of approximately 15 years. So it's moved from 10 years to 15 years, which is consistent with the term of the lease, including one 5-year renewal option. Store and warehouse equipment is now depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of each asset, which now ranges from 10 years to 15 years. The effect of these changes was a decrease of approximately $4 million in depreciation expense for the 13-week period ended May 4, 2014. These changes reflect our current reality whereby the change in estimated depreciation rates match the economic life of those assets. \r\nAnd if I may, I'd get out of the script for 2 seconds. This $4 million, which applies to Q1, will also apply in Q2, Q3 and Q4. In other words, you will see the same impact. So that over the year, it's going to be a $16 million, that's 1-6 million dollar decrease in depreciation and amortization. And this change was driven mainly by the increase in number of leases extending into the first renewal option.\r\nSo back into the script now. Q1 net earnings increased to $53.2 million or $0.78 per diluted share compared to $45.6 million or $0.62 per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal 2014. The EPS this quarter would have been $0.74 per share if we exclude the $0.04 positive impact of the change in accounting estimate. Cash flows from operations increased to $18 million in Q1 from $13 million in the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal year.\r\nDuring the month of May, we modified our capital structure by issuing floating rate senior unsecured notes in the aggregate principal amount of $150 million maturing in May 2017. The net proceeds of the offering have been used to repay indebtedness outstanding under the revolving credit facility. The offering has allowed us to lock in, for a period of 3 years, a favorable interest rate spreads of 0.54% over that 3-month VAs, which is much lower than our current spread over VAs on the revolving facility.\r\nDuring the quarter, we repurchased for cancellation a total of 1.8 million shares for a total cash consideration of $154 million. During the period following the quarter, following May 4, 2014, until June 11, which is yesterday, we repurchased an additional 800,000 shares for a total cash consideration of $74.6 million. Therefore, since the launch of June 17 last year, 2013, of the 2013-2014 NCIB, and through June 11, 2014, we have bought back a total of 6.3 million shares, which represents 9.4% of the corporation's public float, at a weighted average price of $82.45 per share for a total cash consideration of $521.6 million. This morning, we also announced that we will be renewing our normal course issuer bid program, which will allow the purchase for cancellation of up to 3.5% of outstanding shares at June 11, 2014, over the period from June 17, 2014, to June 16, 2015.\r\nNow let me give you an update with regards to our productivity initiatives. Compared to last year, we have reduced the number of manual daily counts at store level and increased our reliance on scan data for replenishment purposes. We completed the rollout of Kronos advanced scheduling functionally in all of our stores. The Kronos solution is used to manage time and attendance, as well as labor scheduling in our stores and warehouses. In fiscal 2015, we will continue benefiting from improved labor allocations brought forward by this initiative. \r\nOver the next few months, we will be taking advantage of some features of the new point-of-sale terminals rolled out to all of our stores last fall as we begin to implement new cash management procedures to improve efficiency of store processes.\r\nOverall, we are very pleased with the financial and operating performance of the company this quarter and the progress made on our key initiatives that will support profitable growth in the future.\r\nThis ends our formal remarks and we can now take questions.\r\nOperator, I'll turn it -- I'll turn the call over to you.",

This progression is the result of the improved labor productivity achieved through initiatives implemented at the store level. \r\nIt should be noted that effective June 1, 2014, the Province of Ontario implemented a 7.3% minimum wage increase that, going forward in fiscal 2015, will create some headwinds against our productivity initiative gains. Overall, we still expect a slight improvement in the G&A ratio for the full fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. In Q1, our EBITDA grew 13% to $86.2 million or 17.2% of sales. \r\nOur depreciation and amortization expense decreased by $2.4 million this quarter due partially to a change in the estimated useful life of our leasehold improvements and store and warehouse equipment. IFRS requires a review, at least annually, of the residual value and useful life of fixed assets subject to depreciation. As a result of the review of leasehold improvements and store and warehouse equipment effective February 3, 2014, we increased the estimated useful lives of substantially all of the leasehold improvements and store and warehouse equipment. \r\nLeasehold improvements are now depreciated on a straight-line basis over a period of approximately 15 years. So it's moved from 10 years to 15 years, which is consistent with the term of the lease, including one 5-year renewal option. Store and warehouse equipment is now depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of each asset, which now ranges from 10 years to 15 years. The effect of these changes was a decrease of approximately $4 million in depreciation expense for the 13-week period ended May 4, 2014. These changes reflect our current reality whereby the change in estimated depreciation rates match the economic life of those assets. \r\nAnd if I may, I'd get out of the script for 2 seconds. This $4 million, which applies to Q1, will also apply in Q2, Q3 and Q4. In other words, you will see the same impact. So that over the year, it's going to be a $16 million, that's 1-6 million dollar decrease in depreciation and amortization. And this change was driven mainly by the increase in number of leases extending into the first renewal option.\r\nSo back into the script now. Q1 net earnings increased to $53.2 million or $0.78 per diluted share compared to $45.6 million or $0.62 per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal 2014. The EPS this quarter would have been $0.74 per share if we exclude the $0.04 positive impact of the change in accounting estimate. Cash flows from operations increased to $18 million in Q1 from $13 million in the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal year.\r\nDuring the month of May, we modified our capital structure by issuing floating rate senior unsecured notes in the aggregate principal amount of $150 million maturing in May 2017. The net proceeds of the offering have been used to repay indebtedness outstanding under the revolving credit facility. The offering has allowed us to lock in, for a period of 3 years, a favorable interest rate spreads of 0.54% over that 3-month VAs, which is much lower than our current spread over VAs on the revolving facility.\r\nDuring the quarter, we repurchased for cancellation a total of 1.8 million shares for a total cash consideration of $154 million. During the period following the quarter, following May 4, 2014, until June 11, which is yesterday, we repurchased an additional 800,000 shares for a total cash consideration of $74.6 million. Therefore, since the launch of June 17 last year, 2013, of the 2013-2014 NCIB, and through June 11, 2014, we have bought back a total of 6.3 million shares, which represents 9.4% of the corporation's public float, at a weighted average price of $82.45 per share for a total cash consideration of $521.6 million. This morning, we also announced that we will be renewing our normal course issuer bid program, which will allow the purchase for cancellation of up to 3.5% of outstanding shares at June 11, 2014, over the period from June 17, 2014, to June 16, 2015.\r\nNow let me give you an update with regards to our productivity initiatives. Compared to last year, we have reduced the number of manual daily counts at store level and increased our reliance on scan data for replenishment purposes. We completed the rollout of Kronos advanced scheduling functionally in all of our stores. The Kronos solution is used to manage time and attendance, as well as labor scheduling in our stores and warehouses. In fiscal 2015, we will continue benefiting from improved labor allocations brought forward by this initiative. \r\nOver the next few months, we will be taking advantage of some features of the new point-of-sale terminals rolled out to all of our stores last fall as we begin to implement new cash management procedures to improve efficiency of store processes.\r\nOverall, we are very pleased with the financial and operating performance of the company this quarter and the progress made on our key initiatives that will support profitable growth in the future.\r\nThis ends our formal remarks and we can now take questions.\r\nOperator, I'll turn it -- I'll turn the call over to you.",
      "transcript_text3": "I want to dive into the gross margins a bit. The first quarter last year had a gross margin decline as well. And I was wondering if you could go through the factors that caused this year's decline in gross margin, in particular, what's leading to -- what's causing the product cost increases and will those continue.\n\n---\n\nOkay. So -- well as we've stated this year, we anticipate -- we're managing down the margin to secure the top line and stimulate it as much as possible. Obviously, factors that have been impacting negatively, as we mentioned on the last call, you have -- I mean, the one that stands out is the currency. So -- and -- but as we also mentioned, even if the currency would not have impacted as much, we are clearly working the margin down into our -- the 36% to 37% range.\n\n---\n\nAnd on the same-store sales number, and particularly the traffic decline, how is traffic exiting the quarter and what are the various factors that might influence your traffic numbers over the remainder of the year?\n\n---\n\nWell, clearly, we've seen in Q4 and again in Q1 and the traffic -- as I -- we mentioned on the last call, to February and March, we had very poor weather conditions. We're glad to see that the last month that we had nicer weather, so that's been definitely helping out. But clearly, the traffic decline, as it was in Q4, is associated to the poor weather conditions. So, that being out of the way, you should hopefully see traffic coming more into line.\n\n---\n\nYes. We -- it's -- Perry, it's Larry. We seem to see that traffic is really dependent on weather. And people -- if they can't get out of their house, they're not walking over to Dollarama to spend $5 to $10. They may go buy a snowblower at Canadian Tire. But in our case, we need -- not favorable weather, at least not very negative weather and it impacts our traffic. No question. The question -- also, just to add a little bit more color to your former question. I think moving forward, we're -- we'll be looking at some headwinds with respect to gross profits. I think one of them would be the foreign exchange -- negative foreign exchange. Another would be the higher occupancy costs, which continue to not be on our side and continue to climb. Another one, which a lot of people may not be aware of, is China has lost its favored nation status, which, in effect, means that duties on many products will be increased. In other words, I'll give you a few examples, we never paid duty on porcelain, anything we bought in porcelain, porcelain mugs, porcelain plates, et cetera. They're going up from 0% to 7% as a result of this. Other nations have also lost their favorite nation status, but the one that affects us is China. So these are negative headwinds. Plus competitively, we...\n\n---\n\nJanuary.\n\n---\n\nSorry?\n\n---\n\nJust mention.\n\n---\n\nThat's kicking in January. The favored nation business is kicking in, in January. So today, we're buying with that in mind. The products we're buying for next year that we have to pay for it next year, we're keeping these increased costs in mind. So if we -- to pass them on to our customers is easily -- easier said than done, and we have to be very careful when we're doing that. So let's keep all this in mind when we're talking about decreasing our margins from between 36% and 37%.\n\n---\n\nIn your opening remarks, you noted that you had bought back just in excess of 9% of the shares outstanding. It -- under the prior NCIB. So I was wondering if you could walk us through the thinking behind renewing at that 3.5% level.\n\n---\n\nOkay. If I heard you correctly, Irene, the -- so this past year, we had a target of 10%, a 5% increase to 10%. And so we've used up most of the leverage capacity that we have within the investment grade zone. So in other words, to keep our BBB stable rating so we not only use the cash flow generated from operations but -- which was -- and that -- the close to $200 million last year, but also the additional leverage we had to buy back shares. Now that we have attained more or less the -- we're not at the maximum, but we're close to the maximum. We don't have, for the short term, any more leverage capacity. That leverage capacity will build over time as we get more EBITDA in -- record more of the EBITDA. So therefore, what's left is the cash flow generated from operation this year to finance that share buyback. So for the time being, we're going with 3.5% of the -- as a target. And if we get more momentum down the road, then we will look at increasing it if we need to.\n\n---\n\nThat's great, and that's very helpful. Also, just looking at the debit penetration in the quarter at 42%, you're getting closer to that 45-ish level that seems to be kind of the norm for Canada. And wondering whether you had any updated thoughts around the credit card piece.\n\n---\n\nNo, we don't have any new information on the credit -- I mean, debit is -- it continues to move up. It doesn't cost us anything. And right now, we feel comfortable. We'll see if that 45-ish estimated Canadian average holds for us, too. But for the time being, there's no -- nothing going on, on the credit card side.\n\n---\n\nAnd just one final one, if I may. I'm just wondering about the maturation process of the higher price point. What we saw in the past was the buyers getting better and better at anticipating sell-through and consumer demand. I'm just wondering if we're seeing the same kind of thing at the $2.50 and $3 level.\n\n---\n\nIt's Larry, Irene. We're seeing the same kind of thing, at the $2.50 and $3 level. Not yet, but I could see ourselves having that feeling. I don't know how shortly, whether it will be in 6 months, 1 year, 2 years. But I can see eventually that if you're talking about a certain amount of anxiety or a certain amount of feeling that we shouldn't be moving that price point. Is that where you're going with that question?\n\n---\n\nI think it was more around anticipating consumer demand and sell-through for the types of products at the higher price point and getting better at buying them, basically.\n\n---\n\nYes. We're -- I think we're getting better at buying the $2.50 and $3. I think there's more comfort there, and that's all I could say on that particular issue. So I think we're getting better, but that doesn't mean that -- I think where our suppliers are also showing us more at those price points, so not only -- it's -- this is a 2-way street between supplier and buying. And they're showing more items at that price point. So it's making us feel more comfortable that those items that we're buying at those price points are a great value for the customer. I hope that answers your question.\n\n---\n\nI just had a question on your new stores and the ramp-up period to get them -- to get the sales to where you have with your existing store base and the payback. Are we still talking sort of in the 18 months to 24 months range?\n\n---\n\nWell, that's what we -- we're aiming for, absolutely, in terms of quality of real estate. We're going to -- it's going to be -- as I said on the last call, I believe the F '14 cohort will have a bit of a challenge because of the slower Q4 sales, which was our bigger season. So any stores opened during that period obviously inherit, unfortunately, a slower start and, hopefully, that this year, mother nature is on our side and that restores a bit of that. But it's too early to say for this year and last year score -- cohorts. But otherwise, prior to that, they're doing fine.\n\n---\n\nOkay. So I mean, if we were to normalize for weather, you're still sort of in that range, that 18 to 24 month.\n\n---\n\nI would say closer to 24. It's becoming more challenging. It's not becoming easier, the amount of infills we're doing. So if I was to throw you out a number, I'd like you to use more towards the 24, certainly, than the 18.\n\n---\n\nOkay, great. That's very helpful. And then just on your overall store target for Canada, is it -- are we still in that 1,200 range or are you seeing opportunities to open more than that over time?\n\n---\n\nNo, that's still our number.\n\n---\n\nJust given the change in the D&A policy, is there a change in your longer-term view on EBIT margin potential, that 17-ish percent?\n\n---\n\nYes -- no, absolutely. So that follows through.\n\n---\n\nSo sorry, there is a change then or...\n\n---\n\nYes. I mean, we were saying -- we were hoping to keep it around 17%, but that was before the adjustment. So -- but I mean it's not, well, way over. It's still in that range though. But it -- yes.\n\n---\n\nSo in the quarter, obviously, great expense leverage still. A little bit early for us to say that the Ontario wage increase is wholesomely reflected. So with the 60-plus basis point win on the expense rate, would you view that as sort of the expense rate gain that you can get without the wage increase there, or was there something extraordinary in the quarter that would've caused that rate benefit to be larger than what you would expect?\n\n---\n\nYes. There's the bit of the store acceleration we had in Q1 last year, and so there's a bit of timing there. So that's why I'm coming back and cautioning everyone not to model 60 bps per quarter here, but that's why I maintained my slightly improved yearly fiscal '15 G&A ratio. So last year, it had improved to 40 bps year-over-year, and that was without a major wage increase. And this year, I said it would be lower than that given the wage increase that we see. So that's -- so you're -- obviously, you have to model in some wage increases as of this week or last week. But we're hopefully -- we're hoping to slightly improve the G&A year-over-year for fiscal '15.\n\n---\n\nOkay. On the FX impact on cost of goods sold, plus now the favored nation issue, I just want some indication. Like do you -- when do you feel that the FX impact on COGS will be largely fully reflected in your cost of goods sold? Is it sort of by second or is it by third quarter?\n\n---\n\nIt would be more towards the fourth quarter that you could see that.\n\n---\n\nFourth quarter, yes.\n\n---\n\nAnd as part of the way of sort of managing it, we were talking about the $2.50 and $3 items. Do you feel that you have an opportunity to take some of your existing items up into those price points, or are you still a little cautious in terms of how you want to deal with that $2.50, $3 price point range?\n\n---\n\nWell, if you're talking about taking a $2 item to $2.50, it's a big jump. And then taking that $2.50 up to $3 is just as big a jump. So we are cautious as we are in every other price point. It's -- so it's a matter of balancing value and being competitive and timing. So it's to be seen. We're going to play a lot of this stuff by ear and slowly monitoring this whole situation. It's a new situation for us, and having negative FX and having a tough retail environment is not necessarily on my wish list. But...\n\n---\n\nObviously. Do you foresee in a reasonable timeframe, whatever that's supposed to mean, toying around with price points above the $3 level, or do you feel that's sort of on a normalized horizon, that $3...\n\n---\n\nYou're going to have to define reasonable timeframe.\n\n---\n\nWell, obviously, if I was talking 10 years out and we had 3% inflation every year, $3 will become higher than $3. But within a 2-year timeframe, let's say, just for tangibility.\n\n---\n\nThat's really hard to predict. It's really hard to predict that, and I wouldn't even want to go there. We'll try and last at these price points as long as we can. And I can't predict -- I really...\n\n---\n\nIt does sound, though, like on this $2.50 and $3 range, where, at one point in time, you were expressing some concern about the amount of items you could see that you could bring into those price points that that's gotten a little bit better. I don't want to overstate it, but...\n\n---\n\nYes, it has. I think we're being offered more and more of those pricing changes, and the foreign exchange is helping us -- push us up there a little sooner than we would have wanted. I think I could leave it at that.\n\n---\n\nMichael, just a small clarification on the accounting change with respect to depreciation. Was there some threshold level that you were looking at in terms of option, the renewals? Can you tell us like how many? What percentage of your stores you've done the 5-year renewal on?\n\n---\n\nNo. In the one that weren't finished being amortized is the majority.\n\n---\n\nOkay, that's good. And then secondly, just looking forward, and you both referenced the fact that we've had a slow start to the summer, this won't be the first time in your history that you've had a slow start to the summer. Can you talk about the summer season and, typically, what you experience when there is a slow start? Is there ability to catch up? Is it different than other seasonal periods during the year?\n\n---\n\nIt depends how long it lasts. If it lasts until June, the catch-up is negligible. I think we got a break in weather a couple of weeks ago, and it's at -- if I may use an unorthodox word, I think it's catch-uppable at this point. And it's -- that's happening. If it happens, if the weather -- the miserable weather continues into the middle of June, we got the bigger problem and we're going to have carryovers as a result. Thankfully, our carryover is not ice cream, and the carryover are always -- is good merchandise that's bought -- can be kept for next year. It's not something we want. But again, I think we're doing a good job right now as long as it stops raining outside of Montréal here and we get some sun, that we can continue this catch-up very easily.\n\n---\n\nLarry, that's useful. And then a third question, just around the higher occupancy costs. And the increased rent that you're seeing, is that related to just higher rents overall, or does it really relate primarily to going into more downtown locations where, obviously, rents would obviously be higher in any case?\n\n---\n\nI think it's both. I think, overall, rents are higher, although it seems to have leveled off. But it just can't continue going higher and higher. And the fact that if we want to go into the GTA or into downtown Vancouver, downtown Montréal, downtown Toronto, Calgary, it's more expensive. We're trying to control the size of the stores a little better that we go down -- that we go into, which means it creates logistical problems. But other than that, I think both of your statements are correct. It's both.\n\n---\n\nOkay, all right. And then lastly, if I may, and hopefully I can sort of phrase this question in a way that you understand what I'm getting at. But in the past and you -- we talked about -- we're always talking about the management of the gross margin and the compelling value and the content that you're putting into the products to ensure value for the customer. And at the end of the day, it really does come to a gap between the value perceived at Dollarama versus the valued -- for the -- a like product in a competitor. And there have been points in time where you've laid it out for us that the perception is that for a $1 item at Dollarama's is believed they'd be paying X times more at Walmart or somewhere else and the same thing with the 2. And do you still have the strategy and the viewpoint and focus on your business that you want to maintain that perceived gap at around the same levels?\n\n---\n\nI guess we have one word for that, absolutely.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Would you want to elaborate or that's -- that just nails it?\n\n---\n\nI can elaborate on the word absolutely, but I think that does it. It's -- yes, we always want to maintain a certain gap in value. I think that's the idea.\n\n---\n\nSo just going back to the question about maintaining the compelling value to customers. So especially with all the headwinds at gross margin with FX and the favorable nations dropping off, so especially at the $1 price points, are the buyers just going to have an increasingly more difficult time to find these products? And if so, what are they doing to -- what kind of tools can they use to downplay these other headwinds?\n\n---\n\nWell, let's be honest here, that $1 price point, we're being offered less and less product when we travel. I don't think China and the -- and their workforce is interested as much as they were several years ago to innovate at the $1 price point. There's basically one country, and that's the United States, that can sell those products at that -- at those price points. Today, I think in Canada's case, and certainly in Europe's case, those $1 price points are becoming more like $1.25. And we're so -- so that's managing again. It's a kind of an art of saying, \"We won't buy this item at $1 any longer, but we'll buy a slightly different article with a little better value and be able to get the $1.25 and even $1.50 by just migrating the entire item to a just a little better quality.\" So we're doing that all the time. We've done that all our life, and that's part of the game.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And just a follow-up question for the decreased depreciation. So can we assume that the Q1 number to be representative going forward for the current amount of stores plus the new stores that comes up?\n\n---\n\nRight. By -- I mean, just for this year, it's approximately the same. So you can now assume $4 million per quarter.\n\n---\n\nYes. I was wondering if you know roughly the percentage of your products from China that will be subject to a tariff.\n\n---\n\nNo, I don't. And I'm answering that very quickly because I really don't. We haven't concentrated too much on working those numbers. I know some categories. But to say that 80% or 60% or 50% or 40%, those are numbers that have neither been provided to me nor -- maybe they should be, eventually. But I think it's category by...\n\n---\n\nWe wouldn't disclose that, Larry, anyway.\n\n---\n\nWe're not going to tell you anyway, Keith. So the answer is no, Keith. I don't know.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then just on the products that are priced at $2.50 and $3, how does the turnover rate of those products compare to products at $1, for example?\n\n---\n\nWell, it's -- we don't -- Keith, we don't disclose that detail of information.\n\n---\n\nI don't think -- I don't even know if we have.\n\n---\n\nNo, we have a lot of the information. But -- we have all of that, but we don't disclose it. So -- for obviously...\n\n---\n\nAnd then just on the 1,200 stores you anticipate for Canada, this is obviously a difficult thing to estimate. But what is your parameter for doing that? Is it sort of one store per 30,000 people, or do you have sort of done it market by market? Or how do you come -- arrive at that just conceptually?\n\n---\n\nSo personally, I don't like that number of 1,200 stores, and I don't like using it. But since we are, you're asking how do we get there?\n\n---\n\nRight.\n\n---\n\nYes. No -- yes. So what we did is we work with an application called Tactician One. We have a group of consultants that map out the country by population size, density, retail activity. And we factor in competition, other dollar stores, Walmarts, Targets. And then we -- and we profile the areas, then we -- so that's how we estimate the 1,200 stores.\n\n---\n\nSo, Keith, all that said, Dollar Tree estimates opening 800 to 1,000 stores. What do you want me to tell you? If you want to get stuck on 1,200 -- I don't like using any number, because I've always underestimated the amount of stores we can put into a certain area. So I think that's a very conservative number. There's no -- there hasn't been a science into establishing that number, okay. But then you ought to ask Dollar Tree how they get to 800 to 1,000 stores and what science they used. So I'm a little -- I don't like using those numbers. As opportunities arise, we'll just keep going. It may end up being 1,200, 1,300, 1,400, 1,500. I don't know, Keith.\n\n---\n\nAnd then I'm just wondering if you could update us on -- and I know it's very small at this point, but on the progress in Latin America or Central America, I guess it is.\n\n---\n\nWell, this morning at the AGM, we kind of said we like the progress there. By progress, I mean the -- I like their sales reports that we're getting as a result of the fact of the direction we've given them. I like the fact that they're opening stores, not quite at the rate we are, but proportionally so. And I think the experience down there is a positive one so far. We're learning a lot about international business, and I think it's been positive in every respect.\n\n---\n\nYes. Sorry, go ahead.\n\n---\n\nAnd so where would they be now in terms of the number of stores.\n\n---\n\nThe numbers? No, we don't disclose. Keith, as we said before, it's immaterial. We still have a ways to go. So to date, as Larry said, it's going well. So we're continuing with the project.\n\n---\n\nYes. It's a small country, Keith. So if you had 15 stores when we started, you'd be opening a few stores every year. And it's more a learning experience than it is measuring how many stores they can open in a certain period of time. We've learned a lot by that experience.\n\n---\n\nAnd just wondering, if I might ask, what your view is on entering the U.S. market.\n\n---\n\nWe have no views on entering the U.S. market.\n\n---\n\nThat's a tough market. Personally, I've always said that, competitively, it's a tough market to get into. And we haven't taken it any further than that honestly. We liked the challenge of the Latin American countries. We think there's more opportunity there than getting involved in that jungle in the States. So my view is kind of negative at the moment. Doesn't mean it's -- it will be permanently negative. Things change. But at the moment, it's not positive that we're going to get involved in that market. Again, we prefer the opportunities in the Latin American countries.",

Another one, which a lot of people may not be aware of, is China has lost its favored nation status, which, in effect, means that duties on many products will be increased. In other words, I'll give you a few examples, we never paid duty on porcelain, anything we bought in porcelain, porcelain mugs, porcelain plates, et cetera. They're going up from 0% to 7% as a result of this. Other nations have also lost their favorite nation status, but the one that affects us is China. So these are negative headwinds. Plus competitively, we...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nJanuary.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nSorry?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nJust mention.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nThat's kicking in January. The favored nation business is kicking in, in January. So today, we're buying with that in mind. The products we're buying for next year that we have to pay for it next year, we're keeping these increased costs in mind. So if we -- to pass them on to our customers is easily -- easier said than done, and we have to be very careful when we're doing that. So let's keep all this in mind when we're talking about decreasing our margins from between 36% and 37%.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Irene Nattel (Analysts)】\nIn your opening remarks, you noted that you had bought back just in excess of 9% of the shares outstanding. It -- under the prior NCIB. So I was wondering if you could walk us through the thinking behind renewing at that 3.5% level.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nOkay. If I heard you correctly, Irene, the -- so this past year, we had a target of 10%, a 5% increase to 10%. And so we've used up most of the leverage capacity that we have within the investment grade zone. So in other words, to keep our BBB stable rating so we not only use the cash flow generated from operations but -- which was -- and that -- the close to $200 million last year, but also the additional leverage we had to buy back shares. Now that we have attained more or less the -- we're not at the maximum, but we're close to the maximum. We don't have, for the short term, any more leverage capacity. That leverage capacity will build over time as we get more EBITDA in -- record more of the EBITDA. So therefore, what's left is the cash flow generated from operation this year to finance that share buyback. So for the time being, we're going with 3.5% of the -- as a target. And if we get more momentum down the road, then we will look at increasing it if we need to.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Irene Nattel (Analysts)】\nThat's great, and that's very helpful. Also, just looking at the debit penetration in the quarter at 42%, you're getting closer to that 45-ish level that seems to be kind of the norm for Canada. And wondering whether you had any updated thoughts around the credit card piece.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nNo, we don't have any new information on the credit -- I mean, debit is -- it continues to move up. It doesn't cost us anything. And right now, we feel comfortable. We'll see if that 45-ish estimated Canadian average holds for us, too. But for the time being, there's no -- nothing going on, on the credit card side.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Irene Nattel (Analysts)】\nAnd just one final one, if I may. I'm just wondering about the maturation process of the higher price point. What we saw in the past was the buyers getting better and better at anticipating sell-through and consumer demand. I'm just wondering if we're seeing the same kind of thing at the $2.50 and $3 level.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nIt's Larry, Irene. We're seeing the same kind of thing, at the $2.50 and $3 level. Not yet, but I could see ourselves having that feeling. I don't know how shortly, whether it will be in 6 months, 1 year, 2 years. But I can see eventually that if you're talking about a certain amount of anxiety or a certain amount of feeling that we shouldn't be moving that price point. Is that where you're going with that question?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Irene Nattel (Analysts)】\nI think it was more around anticipating consumer demand and sell-through for the types of products at the higher price point and getting better at buying them, basically.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nYes. We're -- I think we're getting better at buying the $2.50 and $3. I think there's more comfort there, and that's all I could say on that particular issue. So I think we're getting better, but that doesn't mean that -- I think where our suppliers are also showing us more at those price points, so not only -- it's -- this is a 2-way street between supplier and buying. And they're showing more items at that price point. So it's making us feel more comfortable that those items that we're buying at those price points are a great value for the customer. I hope that answers your question.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Derek Dley (Analysts)】\nI just had a question on your new stores and the ramp-up period to get them -- to get the sales to where you have with your existing store base and the payback. Are we still talking sort of in the 18 months to 24 months range?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nWell, that's what we -- we're aiming for, absolutely, in terms of quality of real estate. We're going to -- it's going to be -- as I said on the last call, I believe the F '14 cohort will have a bit of a challenge because of the slower Q4 sales, which was our bigger season. So any stores opened during that period obviously inherit, unfortunately, a slower start and, hopefully, that this year, mother nature is on our side and that restores a bit of that. But it's too early to say for this year and last year score -- cohorts. But otherwise, prior to that, they're doing fine.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Derek Dley (Analysts)】\nOkay. So I mean, if we were to normalize for weather, you're still sort of in that range, that 18 to 24 month.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nI would say closer to 24. It's becoming more challenging. It's not becoming easier, the amount of infills we're doing. So if I was to throw you out a number, I'd like you to use more towards the 24, certainly, than the 18.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Derek Dley (Analysts)】\nOkay, great. That's very helpful. And then just on your overall store target for Canada, is it -- are we still in that 1,200 range or are you seeing opportunities to open more than that over time?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nNo, that's still our number.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Vishal Shreedhar (Analysts)】\nJust given the change in the D&A policy, is there a change in your longer-term view on EBIT margin potential, that 17-ish percent?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nYes -- no, absolutely. So that follows through.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Vishal Shreedhar (Analysts)】\nSo sorry, there is a change then or...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nYes. I mean, we were saying -- we were hoping to keep it around 17%, but that was before the adjustment. So -- but I mean it's not, well, way over. It's still in that range though. But it -- yes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Durran (Analysts)】\nSo in the quarter, obviously, great expense leverage still. A little bit early for us to say that the Ontario wage increase is wholesomely reflected. So with the 60-plus basis point win on the expense rate, would you view that as sort of the expense rate gain that you can get without the wage increase there, or was there something extraordinary in the quarter that would've caused that rate benefit to be larger than what you would expect?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nYes. There's the bit of the store acceleration we had in Q1 last year, and so there's a bit of timing there. So that's why I'm coming back and cautioning everyone not to model 60 bps per quarter here, but that's why I maintained my slightly improved yearly fiscal '15 G&A ratio. So last year, it had improved to 40 bps year-over-year, and that was without a major wage increase. And this year, I said it would be lower than that given the wage increase that we see. So that's -- so you're -- obviously, you have to model in some wage increases as of this week or last week. But we're hopefully -- we're hoping to slightly improve the G&A year-over-year for fiscal '15.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Durran (Analysts)】\nOkay. On the FX impact on cost of goods sold, plus now the favored nation issue, I just want some indication. Like do you -- when do you feel that the FX impact on COGS will be largely fully reflected in your cost of goods sold? Is it sort of by second or is it by third quarter?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nIt would be more towards the fourth quarter that you could see that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nFourth quarter, yes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Durran (Analysts)】\nAnd as part of the way of sort of managing it, we were talking about the $2.50 and $3 items. Do you feel that you have an opportunity to take some of your existing items up into those price points, or are you still a little cautious in terms of how you want to deal with that $2.50, $3 price point range?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nWell, if you're talking about taking a $2 item to $2.50, it's a big jump. And then taking that $2.50 up to $3 is just as big a jump. So we are cautious as we are in every other price point. It's -- so it's a matter of balancing value and being competitive and timing. So it's to be seen. We're going to play a lot of this stuff by ear and slowly monitoring this whole situation. It's a new situation for us, and having negative FX and having a tough retail environment is not necessarily on my wish list. But...\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Durran (Analysts)】\nObviously. Do you foresee in a reasonable timeframe, whatever that's supposed to mean, toying around with price points above the $3 level, or do you feel that's sort of on a normalized horizon, that $3...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nYou're going to have to define reasonable timeframe.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Durran (Analysts)】\nWell, obviously, if I was talking 10 years out and we had 3% inflation every year, $3 will become higher than $3. But within a 2-year timeframe, let's say, just for tangibility.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nThat's really hard to predict. It's really hard to predict that, and I wouldn't even want to go there. We'll try and last at these price points as long as we can. And I can't predict -- I really...\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Durran (Analysts)】\nIt does sound, though, like on this $2.50 and $3 range, where, at one point in time, you were expressing some concern about the amount of items you could see that you could bring into those price points that that's gotten a little bit better. I don't want to overstate it, but...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nYes, it has. I think we're being offered more and more of those pricing changes, and the foreign exchange is helping us -- push us up there a little sooner than we would have wanted. I think I could leave it at that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Patricia Baker (Analysts)】\nMichael, just a small clarification on the accounting change with respect to depreciation. Was there some threshold level that you were looking at in terms of option, the renewals? Can you tell us like how many? What percentage of your stores you've done the 5-year renewal on?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nNo. In the one that weren't finished being amortized is the majority.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Patricia Baker (Analysts)】\nOkay, that's good. And then secondly, just looking forward, and you both referenced the fact that we've had a slow start to the summer, this won't be the first time in your history that you've had a slow start to the summer. Can you talk about the summer season and, typically, what you experience when there is a slow start? Is there ability to catch up? Is it different than other seasonal periods during the year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nIt depends how long it lasts. If it lasts until June, the catch-up is negligible. I think we got a break in weather a couple of weeks ago, and it's at -- if I may use an unorthodox word, I think it's catch-uppable at this point. And it's -- that's happening. If it happens, if the weather -- the miserable weather continues into the middle of June, we got the bigger problem and we're going to have carryovers as a result. Thankfully, our carryover is not ice cream, and the carryover are always -- is good merchandise that's bought -- can be kept for next year. It's not something we want. But again, I think we're doing a good job right now as long as it stops raining outside of Montréal here and we get some sun, that we can continue this catch-up very easily.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Patricia Baker (Analysts)】\nLarry, that's useful. And then a third question, just around the higher occupancy costs. And the increased rent that you're seeing, is that related to just higher rents overall, or does it really relate primarily to going into more downtown locations where, obviously, rents would obviously be higher in any case?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nI think it's both. I think, overall, rents are higher, although it seems to have leveled off. But it just can't continue going higher and higher. And the fact that if we want to go into the GTA or into downtown Vancouver, downtown Montréal, downtown Toronto, Calgary, it's more expensive. We're trying to control the size of the stores a little better that we go down -- that we go into, which means it creates logistical problems. But other than that, I think both of your statements are correct. It's both.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Patricia Baker (Analysts)】\nOkay, all right. And then lastly, if I may, and hopefully I can sort of phrase this question in a way that you understand what I'm getting at. But in the past and you -- we talked about -- we're always talking about the management of the gross margin and the compelling value and the content that you're putting into the products to ensure value for the customer. And at the end of the day, it really does come to a gap between the value perceived at Dollarama versus the valued -- for the -- a like product in a competitor. And there have been points in time where you've laid it out for us that the perception is that for a $1 item at Dollarama's is believed they'd be paying X times more at Walmart or somewhere else and the same thing with the 2. And do you still have the strategy and the viewpoint and focus on your business that you want to maintain that perceived gap at around the same levels?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nI guess we have one word for that, absolutely.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Patricia Baker (Analysts)】\nOkay. Would you want to elaborate or that's -- that just nails it?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nI can elaborate on the word absolutely, but I think that does it. It's -- yes, we always want to maintain a certain gap in value. I think that's the idea.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Emily Foo (Analysts)】\nSo just going back to the question about maintaining the compelling value to customers. So especially with all the headwinds at gross margin with FX and the favorable nations dropping off, so especially at the $1 price points, are the buyers just going to have an increasingly more difficult time to find these products? And if so, what are they doing to -- what kind of tools can they use to downplay these other headwinds?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nWell, let's be honest here, that $1 price point, we're being offered less and less product when we travel. I don't think China and the -- and their workforce is interested as much as they were several years ago to innovate at the $1 price point. There's basically one country, and that's the United States, that can sell those products at that -- at those price points. Today, I think in Canada's case, and certainly in Europe's case, those $1 price points are becoming more like $1.25. And we're so -- so that's managing again. It's a kind of an art of saying, \"We won't buy this item at $1 any longer, but we'll buy a slightly different article with a little better value and be able to get the $1.25 and even $1.50 by just migrating the entire item to a just a little better quality.\" So we're doing that all the time. We've done that all our life, and that's part of the game.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Emily Foo (Analysts)】\nOkay. And just a follow-up question for the decreased depreciation. So can we assume that the Q1 number to be representative going forward for the current amount of stores plus the new stores that comes up?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nRight. By -- I mean, just for this year, it's approximately the same. So you can now assume $4 million per quarter.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Keith Howlett (Analysts)】\nYes. I was wondering if you know roughly the percentage of your products from China that will be subject to a tariff.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nNo, I don't. And I'm answering that very quickly because I really don't. We haven't concentrated too much on working those numbers. I know some categories. But to say that 80% or 60% or 50% or 40%, those are numbers that have neither been provided to me nor -- maybe they should be, eventually. But I think it's category by...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nWe wouldn't disclose that, Larry, anyway.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nWe're not going to tell you anyway, Keith. So the answer is no, Keith. I don't know.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Keith Howlett (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then just on the products that are priced at $2.50 and $3, how does the turnover rate of those products compare to products at $1, for example?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nWell, it's -- we don't -- Keith, we don't disclose that detail of information.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nI don't think -- I don't even know if we have.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nNo, we have a lot of the information. But -- we have all of that, but we don't disclose it. So -- for obviously...\n\n---\n\n【質問: Keith Howlett (Analysts)】\nAnd then just on the 1,200 stores you anticipate for Canada, this is obviously a difficult thing to estimate. But what is your parameter for doing that? Is it sort of one store per 30,000 people, or do you have sort of done it market by market? Or how do you come -- arrive at that just conceptually?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nSo personally, I don't like that number of 1,200 stores, and I don't like using it. But since we are, you're asking how do we get there?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Keith Howlett (Analysts)】\nRight.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nYes. No -- yes. So what we did is we work with an application called Tactician One. We have a group of consultants that map out the country by population size, density, retail activity. And we factor in competition, other dollar stores, Walmarts, Targets. And then we -- and we profile the areas, then we -- so that's how we estimate the 1,200 stores.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nSo, Keith, all that said, Dollar Tree estimates opening 800 to 1,000 stores. What do you want me to tell you? If you want to get stuck on 1,200 -- I don't like using any number, because I've always underestimated the amount of stores we can put into a certain area. So I think that's a very conservative number. There's no -- there hasn't been a science into establishing that number, okay. But then you ought to ask Dollar Tree how they get to 800 to 1,000 stores and what science they used. So I'm a little -- I don't like using those numbers. As opportunities arise, we'll just keep going. It may end up being 1,200, 1,300, 1,400, 1,500. I don't know, Keith.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Keith Howlett (Analysts)】\nAnd then I'm just wondering if you could update us on -- and I know it's very small at this point, but on the progress in Latin America or Central America, I guess it is.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nWell, this morning at the AGM, we kind of said we like the progress there. By progress, I mean the -- I like their sales reports that we're getting as a result of the fact of the direction we've given them. I like the fact that they're opening stores, not quite at the rate we are, but proportionally so. And I think the experience down there is a positive one so far. We're learning a lot about international business, and I think it's been positive in every respect.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nYes. Sorry, go ahead.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Keith Howlett (Analysts)】\nAnd so where would they be now in terms of the number of stores.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nThe numbers? No, we don't disclose. Keith, as we said before, it's immaterial. We still have a ways to go. So to date, as Larry said, it's going well. So we're continuing with the project.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nYes. It's a small country, Keith. So if you had 15 stores when we started, you'd be opening a few stores every year. And it's more a learning experience than it is measuring how many stores they can open in a certain period of time. We've learned a lot by that experience.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Keith Howlett (Analysts)】\nAnd just wondering, if I might ask, what your view is on entering the U.S. market.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nWe have no views on entering the U.S. market.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nThat's a tough market. Personally, I've always said that, competitively, it's a tough market to get into. And we haven't taken it any further than that honestly. We liked the challenge of the Latin American countries. We think there's more opportunity there than getting involved in that jungle in the States. So my view is kind of negative at the moment. Doesn't mean it's -- it will be permanently negative. Things change. But at the moment, it's not positive that we're going to get involved in that market. Again, we prefer the opportunities in the Latin American countries.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you, Brandi, and good morning, everyone. On the call today are Rick Dreiling, our Chairman and CEO; and David Tehle, our CFO. We'll first go through our prepared remarks, and then we will open up the call for questions. Our earnings release issued today can be found on our website at dollargeneral.com, under Investor Information, Press Releases. \r\nLet me caution you that today's comments will include forward-looking statements about our expectations, plans, predictions and other nonhistorical matters, such as our 2014 forecasted financial results and capital expenditures; our planned fiscal 2014 operating, merchandising and store growth initiatives; our share repurchase expectations; and statements regarding future consumer economic trends. Important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those reflected in or implied by our forward-looking statements are included in our earnings release issued this morning; our 2013 10-K, which was filed on March 20, 2014, and our 2014 first quarter 10-Q filed this morning; and in the comments that are made on this call. We encourage you to read these documents. You should not unduly rely on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of today's date. Dollar General disclaims any obligation to update or revise any information discussed in this call. \r\nWe will also reference certain financial measures not derived in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in this morning's earnings release, which, I've mentioned, is posted on dollargeneral.com. \r\nNow it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Rick.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Mary Winn. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today. As we expected when we gave our first quarter outlook in March, the challenges of weather, the heightened competitive environment and the current economic environment continued to impact our sales. However, as we reported today, our first quarter sales performance proved to even be more challenging than anticipated. \r\nAs we said in March, as the weather normalized, our sales trends improved. We saw a turn in our business during April, even as we take into account the Easter shift. That momentum has continued quarter-to-date. In quarter 2, we are seeing strength across both our consumables and the non-consumable categories. The impact of the inclement weather across much of the country affected each first of the month in the quarter, typically the strongest sales week, so we essentially lost the opportunity for sales across the first of each month. \r\nAlthough our sales performance was softer than we anticipated for the first quarter, there were several positive highlights. For example, in addition to the favorable impact of the Easter shift on the Easter-related sales, we saw an improvement in our comp sales trends across the store as we moved through April. Based on our current sales trends, I believe that we are starting to see our initiatives gain traction, albeit a little later than we had anticipated. David will provide more details on our financial results in a moment, but I want to share just a few highlights. \r\nOur net sales increased 6.8% over last year to over $4.5 billion. Same-store sales grew 1.5%. We are pleased to report that both customer traffic and average ticket increased for the 25th consecutive quarter. As expected, April was stronger than February and March for several reasons, including the shift in timing of Easter. We had a very good Easter as we saw our sell-through rates increase significantly from prior years' Easter sales. \r\nOur gross margin as a percentage of sales declined 57 basis points primarily due to the increase in the sales of lower-margin consumables, including tobacco and perishables, as a percentage of overall sales. \r\nSG&A increased by 37 basis points, primarily the result of deleverage on rent and utility costs resulting in part from our same-store sales performance, as well as additional costs incurred due to the extreme winter weather. \r\nNet income was $222 million. Earnings per diluted share was $0.72, at the low end of our guidance. We returned $800 million in cash to shareholders through the repurchase of 14.1 million shares of stock, bringing our total cash return to shareholders since the inception of our store (sic) [share] repurchase program in December of 2011 to $2.3 billion. We are maintaining our sales and earnings per share guidance for the year. \r\nI'll talk more about our operating initiatives for 2014 in a moment, but now I'd like to turn the call over to David.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Rick covered the highlights of our first quarter sales performance, so I'll share more details on the rest of the results, starting with gross profit. Gross profit increased 5% for the quarter with a 57 basis point decrease in gross profit rate to 30.0% of sales. This decrease was primarily driven by the higher mix of lower-margin consumables, which includes tobacco and perishables. In addition, we incurred higher markdowns primarily due to promotional activities in consumables, which were partially offset by better initial markups. \r\nSG&A expense increased 9% to $978 million or 21.6% of sales, an increase of 37 basis points over the 2013 period. The impact of lower sales growth affected our ability to leverage our fixed costs, with rent and utilities having the most significant impact. Adverse weather also contributed to higher utility cost. As we called out in the fourth quarter, SG&A in 2014 is impacted by the sale-leaseback transaction, adding about 5 basis points in the first quarter. Decreases in workers' compensation and general liability expenses partially offset the overall increase in SG&A as a percentage of sales. \r\nAs of May 2, total merchandise inventories were $2.6 billion, up 1% on a per-store basis. Over the last 5 quarters, we've made great progress in managing our inventory growth to be in line with sales growth. We are very pleased with our performance here. \r\nWe generated cash from operations of $251 million in the quarter. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $84 million, including $27 million for improvements, upgrades, remodels and relocations of existing stores; $25 million related to new leased stores; $14 million for information systems upgrades and technology-related projects; $12 million for distribution and transportation; and $6 million for stores we built. \r\nRegarding our share repurchase program, as Rick mentioned, we repurchased 14.1 million shares for $800 million in the first quarter. Since the inception of the share repurchase program in December 2011, we've repurchased 44.5 million shares, with a total return of cash to shareholders of $2.3 billion. We currently have a remaining authorization of $223 million. \r\nTurning now to guidance. At the time of our fourth quarter earnings call in March, we provided a significant amount of detail to help you build your models. Looking forward, we continue to expect top line sales for 2014 to increase 8% to 9%. Overall square footage is expected to grow about 6% to 7%, and same-store sales are expected to increase 3% to 4%. While there may be some puts and takes in our operating performance, we are managing the business for the long-term benefit of the company and its shareholders. We continue to expect diluted earnings per share for the year of $3.45 to $3.55. \r\nWe're committed to maintaining our investment-grade rating while managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDA. This quarter, we temporarily increased our debt levels based on our share repurchases in the quarter. We're anticipating that we will repurchase $1.1 billion of our common stock this fiscal year. This includes the $800 million of share repurchases completed in the first quarter. For the year, we plan to open approximately 700 new stores, and capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $450 million to $500 million. \r\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Rick.\n\n---\n\nThanks, David. I was pleased to see our overall business trends improve as the quarter progressed, and we are well positioned to achieve our 2014 objectives as we enter the second quarter. We remain focused on executing our top priorities -- top initiatives supporting our operating priorities in 2014. My goal is to share some of the insights into how we are thinking about sales and initiatives that support the projected acceleration of comp sales. \r\nFirst, as many of you have consistently heard from me, our disciplined category management is the foundation for our limited assortment offering and staying relevant to our customer. Today, more than ever, given the economic environment that has lingered for quite some time, affordability has now become the focus of our core customer. What affordability means to our customer today is the trade-off between price and quality that best fits her budget. At times, she is showing a greater willingness to compromise on quality or functionality to get a lower price point to stretch her money. We will never lose sight of our core customer and the trust that she places in us to help her stretch her household budget. In the first quarter alone, 49 planograms have been changed to provide more affordable items on our shelf across about 90% of our departments, making it easier for our customer not only to see great value but also to see affordability. \r\nWe are leveraging the Smart & Simple private brand. Smart & Simple is a great platform that allows us to offer the lowest opening price points in categories on the shelf. The Smart & Simple brand was launched about 6 years ago to deliver affordability. Our customer recognizes that the brand is just as the name indicates and does not expect the product to be a national brand equivalent like our portfolio of other private brands, including Clover Valley, DG Health and DG Home. \r\nSmart & Simple allows us to further expand our product offerings and offer a good product at an opening price point that delivers affordability. This year alone, we will add approximately 40 new Smart & Simple products primarily across food, paper and home cleaning, including items from liquid dish soap to macaroni and cheese. This is complemented by SKU additions in key consumable categories such as food, home cleaning and paper products that are, again, focused on affordability. This includes new items that are a combination of national brands and our private brands. Given our customer's search for affordability, we have placed a renewed focus on the sweet spot for our customer across these important categories. Also, we expect to comp positive in tobacco for the year based on our customers' shopping patterns for this item. \r\nPet food and related products is an important category for our customers. To capitalize on this trend, we implemented a new planogram with a better flow and brand-blocking. At the same time, we have a soft launch that is a complete re-branding of our private brand pet offerings, again, with a focus on opening price points and affordability. The planogram has completely -- has a completely new look and a new feel. We're already seeing some positive sales results as a result of this chain as it rolls out across the organization. \r\nWe have also significantly increased the SKU assortment in the $1 to $5 price points across our non-consumable categories, including seasonal, home decor, stationery, accessories and shoes. We are not waiting on the economy to improve for our core customer as she continues to face headwinds in cost increases. Rather, we are sharpening our price points, and we expect our diligent work across categories to pay off as we move through the year. Our business is about continuous improvement. \r\nWe are also committed as ever to our philosophy of everyday low price to drive traffic in units. Our customers trust our pricing, and we are committed to our brand promise of save time, save money every day. In the current promotional environment, we have begun recently and will continue to selectively and strategically invest in price in key products -- product categories that are sensitive to our customers to reinforce our value message. However, in line with the trust placed in us by our customers, these promotional activities will not be at the expense of EDLP. \r\nLater in the year, we will launch a DG digital coupon platform to accept digital-manufactured coupons and capitalize on this growing trend in retail. We have partnered with Coupons.com, the leader in digital promotions. Using this platform, we will be able to deliver individualized content such as national-manufacturer coupons and DG-exclusive offers to participating customers with the goal to drive trips and basket size. For our customers, the DG digital coupon program is flexible, personal and most importantly, incredibly easy to use. Our pilot to 1,000 stores rolls out in the next few weeks, with the national launch scheduled for completion by October. Over time, we believe this exciting program will drive shopper engagement. \r\nTurning to expense control. We are eliminating work that is non-value-added across every function in Dollar General, with a concentration on our retail operations. Improving efficiencies in our stores has been and will continue to be a significant priority for Dollar General. This is a two-pronged, cross-functional initiative to create time savings that we can reinvest to better manage our stores and service our customers. First, we are removing non-value-added work, and second, we are continuing to eliminate and streamline processes and activities in our stores. We expect these changes to allow our store managers and their teams to enhance their customer service efforts. For example, we have utilized technology to improve our tobacco ordering process and to better facilitate various personnel actions performed by our store managers, both of which provide time savings and improve our visibility to and control around these processes. \r\nThe most significant ongoing work simplification effort relates to our store stocking process. During the fourth quarter of 2013, we rolled out the sorting of our rolltainers in the distribution centers by planogram to eliminate resorting at the stores and to reduce the number of steps or moves required to stock the shelves. We are now rolling out a rolltainer sort that separates promotional merchandise from core merchandise to produce efficiencies in setting promotional planograms and end caps. Throughout the year, we will have several incremental technology improvements that will help our store managers and their teams close the store faster each evening and streamline store reporting of key financial and operational information. \r\nAs I mentioned earlier, we are focused on continuous improvement. As such, we are steadfastly committed to improving shrink and to utilizing the store-by-store optimized shrink level targets developed using applied predictive technology. We know we have a significant room to reduce our inventory shrink on a store-by-store basis, utilizing specific data for each store. This granular approach to controlling and reducing shrink provides us with the ability to prioritize areas for improvement. \r\nEnhancing our customer satisfaction program is another great example of Dollar General's dedication to continuous improvement. Earlier this year, we revamped our program with more actional items directly correlated to store standards in stock and the checkout experience. These new metrics give us a better view on what our customers want and value in our stores. We expect this program to benefit our customers' shopping experience and help drive sales. \r\nA true hallmark of the strength of Dollar General is our real estate processes for new stores, relocations and remodels. We are highly analytical, with a focus on driving returns. We're very pleased with the results of our new stores remodels and relocations over the past several years. We've continued to evolve our traditional Dollar General store and make this small-box model even more relevant. In 2015, we'll enter 3 new states as we introduce the traditional Dollar General store concept into Oregon, Maine and Rhode Island. These states have many communities where the Dollar General brand will resonate over time. \r\nWe currently have approximately 1,400 of our traditional stores in the new DG13 format, which is more -- which is a more convenient layout, improved store stock signage and refreshed yellow and black color scheme. This design is delivering a comp lift above what we've seen with our previous remodels. Importantly, our customers are excited about the fresh look and shopability of this new layout. \r\nWe continue to refine our Dollar General Plus model, which is similar to our traditional store but with wider aisles, increased shelf holding power and significantly expanded coolers. The Dollar General Plus format works very well as a replacement for an existing traditional store, where customers already know and trust Dollar General and where there's also a demand for expanded refrigerated food offerings. We will add about 100 Dollar General Plus stores to our fleet this year, primarily as a tool for relocations, as the returns are in line with the returns on a traditional Dollar General store. \r\nAnd finally, we're continuing to test new ideas in our Dollar General Market concept. 2014 will be another year of test-and-learn for this concept for the existing base, with 5 to 6 new stores being added, as we focus on driving sales, operating profit and returns. At the end of the first quarter, we had 11,338 stores with 83.6 million square feet of selling space in 40 states. \r\nLast year, we upgraded our site selection technology in order to fine-tune the way we look at opportunities for growth and to help us better understand the long-term potential of our small-box store. Our new model estimated more than 14,000 additional opportunities for the industry, 40% higher than our previous estimate of 10,000. Importantly, while our new model estimates our opportunities across all urbanicities, the model identified the highest improvement in opportunities in small town and rural markets. This allows us to capitalize on our strong heritage of serving others in these types of high-return markets. \r\nWe've expanded our test of our life cycle remodel program to build our brand position in the marketplace as there's an opportunity to maximize sales with significantly lower capital expenditures. The life cycle remodel test focuses on our legacy stores that are smaller-footprint stores under 6,500 square feet that have not been updated in more than 7 years. The life cycle remodel improves adjacencies and planogram layout, allowing for a store that's closer to the format of our traditional Dollar General that we are building today. \r\nAdditionally, the number of coolers in these stores is also being increased by 4 to 5 cooler doors each or 1,600 to 2,000 incremental cooler doors in total this year. We plan to complete 400 of these life cycle remodels in 2014, of which we've already completed more than 160 since January. These stores are already driving comparable sales with a lower capital spending requirement than a traditional remodel. Over time, we believe we have a significant base of 2,000 to 3,000 stores eligible for a life cycle remodel. \r\nThe sales and returns on our new stores, relocations and remodels are strong, and we believe that reinvesting in our business through store growth remains the best use of our capital. In 2014, we are ahead of schedule to open approximately 700 new stores and to relocate or remodel approximately 500 stores in addition to the 400 life cycle remodels, resulting in square footage growth of 6% to 7%. \r\nTo wrap up, we've started the second quarter with momentum. Our inventories are in good shape. Our balance sheet and cash flows are strong, and we are on track to distribute over $1 billion to our shareholders through the share repurchases in 2014. We have significant organic new store growth opportunities ahead that are high-return and play to our strength as we have built organizational capacities in our real estate function over time. I remain excited about the long-term opportunities ahead for Dollar General. My gratitude goes out to more than 103,000 Dollar General employees for all they do to fulfill our mission of serving others. \r\nWith that, Mary Winn, I'd be glad to open up the lines for questions.\n\n---\n\nAll right. Brandi, if you'll poll for questions, please?",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Mary Winn Pilkington (Executives)】\nThank you, Brandi, and good morning, everyone. On the call today are Rick Dreiling, our Chairman and CEO; and David Tehle, our CFO. We'll first go through our prepared remarks, and then we will open up the call for questions. Our earnings release issued today can be found on our website at dollargeneral.com, under Investor Information, Press Releases. \r\nLet me caution you that today's comments will include forward-looking statements about our expectations, plans, predictions and other nonhistorical matters, such as our 2014 forecasted financial results and capital expenditures; our planned fiscal 2014 operating, merchandising and store growth initiatives; our share repurchase expectations; and statements regarding future consumer economic trends. Important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those reflected in or implied by our forward-looking statements are included in our earnings release issued this morning; our 2013 10-K, which was filed on March 20, 2014, and our 2014 first quarter 10-Q filed this morning; and in the comments that are made on this call. We encourage you to read these documents. You should not unduly rely on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of today's date. Dollar General disclaims any obligation to update or revise any information discussed in this call. \r\nWe will also reference certain financial measures not derived in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in this morning's earnings release, which, I've mentioned, is posted on dollargeneral.com. \r\nNow it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Rick.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nThank you, Mary Winn. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today. As we expected when we gave our first quarter outlook in March, the challenges of weather, the heightened competitive environment and the current economic environment continued to impact our sales. However, as we reported today, our first quarter sales performance proved to even be more challenging than anticipated. \r\nAs we said in March, as the weather normalized, our sales trends improved. We saw a turn in our business during April, even as we take into account the Easter shift. That momentum has continued quarter-to-date. In quarter 2, we are seeing strength across both our consumables and the non-consumable categories. The impact of the inclement weather across much of the country affected each first of the month in the quarter, typically the strongest sales week, so we essentially lost the opportunity for sales across the first of each month. \r\nAlthough our sales performance was softer than we anticipated for the first quarter, there were several positive highlights. For example, in addition to the favorable impact of the Easter shift on the Easter-related sales, we saw an improvement in our comp sales trends across the store as we moved through April. Based on our current sales trends, I believe that we are starting to see our initiatives gain traction, albeit a little later than we had anticipated. David will provide more details on our financial results in a moment, but I want to share just a few highlights. \r\nOur net sales increased 6.8% over last year to over $4.5 billion. Same-store sales grew 1.5%. We are pleased to report that both customer traffic and average ticket increased for the 25th consecutive quarter. As expected, April was stronger than February and March for several reasons, including the shift in timing of Easter. We had a very good Easter as we saw our sell-through rates increase significantly from prior years' Easter sales. \r\nOur gross margin as a percentage of sales declined 57 basis points primarily due to the increase in the sales of lower-margin consumables, including tobacco and perishables, as a percentage of overall sales. \r\nSG&A increased by 37 basis points, primarily the result of deleverage on rent and utility costs resulting in part from our same-store sales performance, as well as additional costs incurred due to the extreme winter weather. \r\nNet income was $222 million. Earnings per diluted share was $0.72, at the low end of our guidance. We returned $800 million in cash to shareholders through the repurchase of 14.1 million shares of stock, bringing our total cash return to shareholders since the inception of our store (sic) [share] repurchase program in December of 2011 to $2.3 billion. We are maintaining our sales and earnings per share guidance for the year. \r\nI'll talk more about our operating initiatives for 2014 in a moment, but now I'd like to turn the call over to David.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: David Tehle (Executives)】\nThank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Rick covered the highlights of our first quarter sales performance, so I'll share more details on the rest of the results, starting with gross profit.

The impact of lower sales growth affected our ability to leverage our fixed costs, with rent and utilities having the most significant impact. Adverse weather also contributed to higher utility cost. As we called out in the fourth quarter, SG&A in 2014 is impacted by the sale-leaseback transaction, adding about 5 basis points in the first quarter. Decreases in workers' compensation and general liability expenses partially offset the overall increase in SG&A as a percentage of sales. \r\nAs of May 2, total merchandise inventories were $2.6 billion, up 1% on a per-store basis. Over the last 5 quarters, we've made great progress in managing our inventory growth to be in line with sales growth. We are very pleased with our performance here. \r\nWe generated cash from operations of $251 million in the quarter. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $84 million, including $27 million for improvements, upgrades, remodels and relocations of existing stores; $25 million related to new leased stores; $14 million for information systems upgrades and technology-related projects; $12 million for distribution and transportation; and $6 million for stores we built. \r\nRegarding our share repurchase program, as Rick mentioned, we repurchased 14.1 million shares for $800 million in the first quarter.

The life cycle remodel improves adjacencies and planogram layout, allowing for a store that's closer to the format of our traditional Dollar General that we are building today. \r\nAdditionally, the number of coolers in these stores is also being increased by 4 to 5 cooler doors each or 1,600 to 2,000 incremental cooler doors in total this year. We plan to complete 400 of these life cycle remodels in 2014, of which we've already completed more than 160 since January. These stores are already driving comparable sales with a lower capital spending requirement than a traditional remodel. Over time, we believe we have a significant base of 2,000 to 3,000 stores eligible for a life cycle remodel. \r\nThe sales and returns on our new stores, relocations and remodels are strong, and we believe that reinvesting in our business through store growth remains the best use of our capital. In 2014, we are ahead of schedule to open approximately 700 new stores and to relocate or remodel approximately 500 stores in addition to the 400 life cycle remodels, resulting in square footage growth of 6% to 7%. \r\nTo wrap up, we've started the second quarter with momentum. Our inventories are in good shape. Our balance sheet and cash flows are strong, and we are on track to distribute over $1 billion to our shareholders through the share repurchases in 2014. We have significant organic new store growth opportunities ahead that are high-return and play to our strength as we have built organizational capacities in our real estate function over time. I remain excited about the long-term opportunities ahead for Dollar General. My gratitude goes out to more than 103,000 Dollar General employees for all they do to fulfill our mission of serving others. \r\nWith that, Mary Winn, I'd be glad to open up the lines for questions.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Mary Winn Pilkington (Executives)】\nAll right. Brandi, if you'll poll for questions, please?",
      "transcript_text3": "Can you help provide some more color around the price investments, across what percent of the store, maybe number of SKUs? Obviously, Rick, you've been talking about for a while how it's become a much more competitive environment. So just trying to get an idea around those price investments that we're talking about, especially given the fact that your biggest competitor -- direct competitor is also talking about more price investments.\n\n---\n\nYes, Scot, here is how we're looking at this. First off, as I look at the competitive environment, while the competitive environment is intense, it is no more intense than it was when we were in the fourth quarter. It's just kind of remains more at an elevated level. It's not like people are doing silly things out there. The second thing in regards to our major competitor out there, I think it's fair to say they're moving down towards us. I don't think there should be any worry that they're attempting to get under us. I haven't seen anything to indicate that at this time. And then in regards to the investments we're making, and I want to reiterate our commitment to EDLP, as we moved into April and into May, some of the high-traffic, high-penetration items that we've seen in the ad, we made the decision to place them in our ad also. And by the way, when I say that, a handful of items. And you can't -- our environment, you can't operate where a competitor has a better price in an ad -- when you're in the ad with the same item. So a handful of selective items across consumable categories. And again, no major change, no major change in the competitive environment and not seeing many changes at all in our price as it relates to where we are against drug, mass or grocery.\n\n---\n\nGot it. And then Rick, you did talk about kind of private label and private label food. I mean, historically, you guys talked about there's a lot of brand sensitivity around anything that customers were going to put in or on their bodies, I think, was the phrase. Are the customers now at the point where they're becoming more interested in private label food products?\n\n---\n\nAbsolutely, and that's falls to the affordability thing. The private brand, the gap we have in private brand against national brands is pretty significant. And I think, Scot, that provides a wonderful trade-down opportunity for our customers. Then you couple that with the work we're doing on SKUs that are between $1 and $5 across the store, and you're getting a pretty powerful one-two punch directed at affordability.\n\n---\n\nSo as we think about EBIT dollars, guidance this year is low to mid-single-digit growth. That includes the incentive and health care expense build. As we think multiyear, how do you -- do you think this is a mid-teens bottom line algorithm model? Or what's the best way to think about the P&L going forward?\n\n---\n\nYes, this is David. We're not giving long-term guidance at this point. But when we gave our guidance back in March, we felt it was important to point out certain specific items that were hitting the P&L that we believe were more temporary in nature, and you called out some of those. And obviously, we've put them in our press release back in March. So clearly, once you get by those items, you get into a more normalized growth rate if you look at the bottom line of Dollar General. So I think getting by those items is important in terms of understanding our story as we move forward to the future.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then as a follow-up, is sales per square foot approaching about $200 here? How would you rank the productivity opportunities going forward, and how do you see your ability to continue to march this metric higher over time?\n\n---\n\nYes, Matt, I'll take that one. One of the metrics that I'm most proud of is where we are in square footage, sales per square foot. We've started about $163 in January of '08. We're actually at $220 now. And I believe we have -- there's still opportunity there. I can't look at you and say, hey, it's going to be $250 or $270. As we continue to refine our mix, maximize category management, believe it or not, it's one of the metrics we look at the hardest, and we still think we've got room to grow it.\n\n---\n\nMy question was around your initiative with regard to taking price points down. I'm just curious, based on what you've seen in April and May, if you can talk a little bit about what's happening with AUR, UPT, frequency, maybe break it down a little bit for us. And also, if you could just comment on whether these are similar-type margin items as you had before, or is that changing as well?\n\n---\n\nYes. And first of all, I don't want anybody to think we're out there lowering a lot of prices. Our EDLP position has got us incredibly strong as it relates to our competition out there. What we have done, Dan, is taken some items in the ad and trued them up with what's going on around us, right? And again, I think it's really important that I don't want anyone to think the competitive environment has changed radically in the course of the last 1.5 quarters. Our average unit retail is slightly down, and it's driven primarily probably by a little bit of deflation that we're seeing in cereals, grain items, sugar, oil, and we don't have offsetting categories because of our limited amount of SKUs in the store to offset that. And in regards to these new items, $1 to $5, I would say, quite frankly, they probably carry margin rates that are very similar to what we normally deal with. And in some cases, sometimes, the lower-value SKUs actually carry a little more margin.\n\n---\n\nQuick question for you just I guess, maybe to start on the commentary around the comp performance. You obviously mentioned that things improved in April or May. Is there any more color you can give us there? I was just curious as to whether you're, at this point, kind of in line with the full year guidance, or do you need to still drive a continued improvement from here in order to get to that number, particularly as we think about cycling tobacco?\n\n---\n\nLet me tell you -- let me answer it this way. If I looked how I felt where I'm sitting right now in quarter 4 or quarter 1, where I was sitting in the quarter, I feel a whole lot better today. So I think we have seen improving trends the minute the weather changed, so I think we're on track.\n\n---\n\nAnd Rick, if I remember correctly, last quarter, you talked about expecting some improvement in the promotional environment, I guess, throughout the year and how that was sort of factored into how you were thinking about things. Is that still the case, or are you now relying more on sort of like internal initiatives to...\n\n---\n\nYes, a very fair question, Ed. I actually thought, as the weather would improve, that the promotional environment would level off, and that hasn't happened. And we've made a decision on a handful of select items where we need to do the right thing for our customer. We've done that. But the key takeaway is we have not abandoned our commitment to EDLP. I want to make sure everybody understands we are managing this thing, and I did think the promotional activity would slow down. It's not any worse, but on the same token, we're not going to wait around until it does.\n\n---\n\nI guess one quick follow-up to Ed's question on the guidance there. I guess just to be clear, is the expectation that some of the price investments that you're making on gross margin will basically be balanced by some of the cost control initiatives you have put in place? It sounded like they're incremental to what we discussed in the fourth quarter.\n\n---\n\nYes, I think it's fair to say that we're working on cost and working on our margin like we always have. And right now, our #1 emphasis -- our #1 priority is same-store sales growth. And we're seeing -- we started seeing a momentum shift in April, and we're intent, Steve, on keeping that moving.\n\n---\n\nAnd then I guess a separate question, which is one of your competitors who -- Family Dollar announced some store closings going on and also slower store growth openings. How do you think about the opportunity there from a market share standpoint and even real estate selection going forward?\n\n---\n\nYes, really, really solid question. We look at our real estate returns every week, look at our projects. We're opening our stores in that 85% to 90% of our same-store sales base. As I look at our pro forma and how we're actually performing we're at about 101%, I believe, actually doing just a little bit better. I actually think that the slowing down of growth in our competitor will lead to better real estate values for us, hopefully, down the road because there'll be less people fighting over a site.\n\n---\n\nAnd in terms of the closings, do you have any sense for the market share opportunity there?\n\n---\n\nI think that they're scattered all over, and I think we're going to have -- it's kind of like CVS abandoning cigarettes. I think that's one of those things we're going to have let it play out.\n\n---\n\nSo Rick, when you joined the company, a Dollar General store averaged about $170,000 of inventory. And over the following 3 or 4 years, you grew that to about $200,000 per store, and your GMROI increased every year as well. But since 2011, another $30,000 of inventory has been added, but GMROI has dropped for 8 consecutive quarters. So I guess my question is how important is inventory productivity when you're looking at strategic plans? And then particularly, when you're looking at the changes in your private label, mix, pricing, how will that impact GMROI going forward?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think, Dan, as I look at this, I think that's, again, a really solid observation. And I think if you look over the last couple of years, in our desire to become more and more relevant, we added more and more SKUs that, quite frankly, weren't turning as fast as we thought they were going to. And I think it was about this time last year, I actually admitted not only were they not turning as fast, but they were actually creating incremental shrink. And we have begun the process now of -- we've taken now over 600 of those slower-turn items that were creating shrink. In fact, I think we're just about complete with that process. And we get it without incremental markdowns involved. Well, I got tongue-tied there for a minute. So to answer your question, I think if you go back to when I first got here, the fruit was much lower on the ground. It was easier to say we needed this and we needed this and we needed this. Now what happens as we fine-tune our mix, we're going to have to be a little more select going forward. And I think what we should see, as we add more SKUs in the $1 to $5 range, if the affordability strategy works, we should see our inventory turns increase.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And just also one follow-up, maybe for David. We normally don't give too much attention to company guidance, but I did notice that you're not providing a second quarter guidance, which is, in past quarters, you did provide upcoming guidance. Was there a reason for the omission?\n\n---\n\nYes, that's really not a change from the past, Dan. In first quarter -- I mean, in fourth quarter, when we were laying out guidance for the year, we did give some first quarter guidance because there were a lot of ins and outs, and it was very complicated. But if you go back since we went public in 2009, our goal was to give guidance for the full year and try to steer people to that full year guidance and, on a quarterly basis, update the full year guidance. And there may have been select time periods over the last 5 years where we'll comment on a particular quarter. And certainly, as we get through the third quarter and we're talking about the rest of year, there's only one quarter left, so by definition, we're giving quarterly guidance. But in general, we have not given quarterly guidance, and that's not our intent. Again, we'd like to have our investors focus more on the long-term opportunity with Dollar General than the individual quarters.\n\n---\n\nIn terms of gross margin, I think you talked about second quarter, perhaps, getting a little bit better. The first quarter would have been the worst of the year. Given the environment and what you're doing with some pricing, do you still expect that to be the case? And any other puts and takes that you could call out would be appreciated.\n\n---\n\nYes, David, we're not giving specific guidance on gross margin, but let me try to help you a little bit with it. And we tried to spell this out in the fourth quarter, when we were talking about the full year and we gave a little more color on some line items. I think we still think that as we get into the back half of the year and we lap tobacco because the rollout last year ended in the June, July time frame, that we should see the comparisons get a little bit easier on the gross margin. To your point, we still haven't reached that in the second quarter, so there still is pressure, more pressure on the margin in the second quarter than what we'll see the back half of the year as we get to the third quarter and the fourth quarter.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And then as a follow-up, in terms of Family Dollar, when you look at what they've done in the past quarter in terms of taking some price -- or putting through some price investments, how have your stores performed that are near the Family Dollar stores versus the other stores that you have that are not in direct competition with them?\n\n---\n\nDavid, I'm not seeing anything different anywhere across the chain.\n\n---\n\nJust a question regarding the food and consumable categories. Your sales growth was just under 8% this quarter, so you're clearly continuing to gain market share. But that was also the third consecutive quarter of a sequential slowdown in that growth line. I'm just hoping you can speak a little bit more about overall demand of those goods, those basic household goods, and contrast that to all the meaningful additional shelf space that's being allocated across the industry to those products.\n\n---\n\nI think, Paul, as you look at the Nielsen numbers, they would actually tell you that the pie is contracting a little bit. And it's hard to believe that people are eating less or using less detergent, but apparently, they all are at the end of the day. And in fact, we actually have market research that talks about how people are trying to stretch 1 meal into 2 by adding more starch to the product. I think -- and I literally looked at this information last night, literally looked at this last night. The new Nielsen numbers are out. And on a 4-week basis and a 12-week basis, our unit share growth and share growth are accelerating. And I take that as a sign that we are -- the mix we have in the stores, the allocation of product base, how it is on the store is still the right thing to do.\n\n---\n\nPaul, does that help you?\n\n---\n\nNo, that's helpful. And then just to follow up, in terms of the color you're giving on gross margin, just to reiterate, in the second half of the year, as you cycle tobacco, are you comfortable, given your initiatives, that gross margins will be flat to up in the second half?\n\n---\n\nYes. Again, we're not giving specific guidance on what we're seeing in gross margin. But we do see it getting better than what we saw in the first half of the year, in particular, as we get to third and fourth quarter, better than what we will see in first and second quarter.\n\n---\n\nSo I was wondering, Rick, of your take on Walmart's Dollar General strategy as they're talking about it, which is to basically open up some of these Express stores next to DGs, and how the stores performed when you're seeing that activity. And is there anything that you think, as they go from a test to a full-out roll here they're going to do 100 stores this year, that you're going to need to do?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think Walmart is an outstanding competitor, I mean, the largest retailer in the United States. We have experienced Express stores where our stores -- they've been opened up against us. I can tell you, in every instance where that has happened, after 1 year, the stores are comping positive, so it's not like there's this major knockout punch here. I do think that when we take the hit when a Walmart Express opens up, it's no different than with another competitor would open up. So I could actually make an argument if I get them all and just gave you an average, it might even be less. I do think that it's -- the small-box is -- I think it's a different animal to operate in terms of the supply chain. We ship in eaches and rolltainers versus pallets and truckloads. And I think there's a lot more work there that needs to be done. I mean, albeit -- Scott, we do have a nice head start, too, if you look at 11,000 stores out there. So I think they're a great competitor. I think they've done a lot of fantastic things, but I also think -- we're going to open up 700 new stores this year. We're going to enter some new markets next year. So I think we feel pretty good about where we are.\n\n---\n\nI actually agree with some of your comments about Walmart. Fresh in Dollar General, a lot of our research suggests that the fresh trends are fairly significant and that some of these packaged food, you were talking about the Nielsen data earlier, that that maybe switch -- some people switching to fresh. How does Dollar General deal with the trend for what looks like all consumers, even low-end consumers, to buy more fresh?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think one of the things we're wrestling at is -- and I use fresh to mean also more organic, right, as well as just fresh produce and fresh meat. I do think that our customer is becoming a little more receptive to the organic and the fat free. I can tell you, Scott, when I got here 4 or 5 years ago, they actually thought that product cost more. And it probably did now, and now it's actually coming down on the retail. I do know Todd and his team are looking at that. As far as moving into true fresh, true produce, true meat, that's a little more difficult animal to manage. And the key to us has always been that 7,500 to 10,000 SKUs that are core everyday use and I think will continue to fit well with the people who are really pushing the fresh stuff.\n\n---\n\nI'd like to start by just talking about stock buybacks, and I don't know whether you'll add any more, but you did borrow a bit in the first quarter to buy back stock. And as you said, it ended up with leverage that was a little bit higher. If the stock were to stay depressed, would you be willing to go beyond $1.1 billion of stock repurchases? Would you be willing to stay somewhat leveraged or push leverage up a little bit? It seems like the $800 million that you spent so far, you probably got -- did well in terms of where you bought the stock. Would you take advantage of that later in the year?\n\n---\n\nMeredith, this is David. Our target right now today is still to buy back $1.1 billion of stock. And we have said many times that given conditions in the debt and equity markets, we can temporarily change our thoughts on that, change our debt levels. And we did so in Q1, accelerating our purchases due to what we saw in the stock price. And we believe, on a long-term basis, this is very positive for all of our shareholders, particularly our longer-term shareholders. So Rick and I continuously discuss this with our board, but as of right now, the $1.1 billion is kind of where we're locked and loaded on.\n\n---\n\nOkay, great. And then sort of changing gears, these $1 to $5 items and some of the other things that you've been doing to provide a better value, an opening price point in many categories, to what extent would you say that you're getting support from vendors? To what extent are they actually coming up with ideas or being very supportive on developing products and helping to manufacture them? Is this something you guys are mostly doing on your own?\n\n---\n\nYes, actually, Meredith, to be honest, that is combination of both. I think the affordability idea, which we will probably start hearing more about, initiated from our market research and the work that's being done here. While those are manufacturer items, they're more also what I would quantify as in-and-out items, right, like a different brand, an old brand that we are now resurrecting. So it's really a combination of both. But I will tell you, if Todd was sitting here in the room with me, he would say that the vendor community is much more receptive to this kind of thinking than they ever have been in the past.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then I just have one final question about real estate. I mean, somebody already asked you about not having as much competition for real estate from your most similar competitor. But in just more generally, what are you seeing in the real estate environment? Any pressure on rate -- rents and any shortages anywhere? Or do you just still have tons of choice?\n\n---\n\nYes. Well, I think the signal here that's the most obvious is we're already ahead of the 2014 pipeline. We've already moved into the 2015 pipeline, which would tell you the availability of the real estate is as strong as it's been the last couple of years. I would say right now, there might be some minus upward pressure in specific pieces of the country. But overall, I would tell you the rates that we're negotiating for are very consistent with what we've got in the last couple of years. In fact, I could actually tell you we're doing better in California.\n\n---\n\nThat's great. I hear good things about the real estate you're picking in California. Congratulations.\n\n---\n\nYes, we've come a long way on the California thing. We're starting to get really, really excited.\n\n---\n\nMy first question is actually on the apparel business. It looked like there was some nice sequential improvement from Q4. It's still down per foot. But I'm just wondering if you're getting traction from merchandising changes there or it some of that's driven by markdowns.\n\n---\n\nIt's absolutely driven by merchandising. We are, Matt, like I said in my script, we're very pleased with what we're seeing on the non-consumable side, and you haven't heard me say that in a long time.\n\n---\n\nAnything in particular in apparel that's causing that change? It's like a 9 point change Q4 to...\n\n---\n\nYes, I would tell you, and again, I never thought I'd say this, women's hanging apparel and shoes are both doing very well. And what's happening is it's starting to drag -- the halo effect is starting to drag men's with it. Now there's been a lot of hard work done on men's, too, but we're pleased with what we're seeing.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then just secondly, the digital coupon strategy that you mentioned, how does that impact the P&L? And does it replace any circular marketing expense? Could you just explain kind of how that might play out over time?\n\n---\n\nYes, Matt, it's all -- it's driven by manufacturer expense. It's all the FSI coupons that you historically see in the Sunday newspaper. We're going to take all of that digital. And then, of course, sooner or later, we'll probably add some DG offers along with it, but there'll be no P&L hit with the implementation of the program.\n\n---\n\nJust looking back, Rick, part of your success since you became CEO has been the price lead and kind of adopting the Costco philosophy on everyday low price, and I think we'd all agree that that's been the right formula. And I believe some of our price work on others would show that the lead relative to FDO got pretty wide the past few years, and some studies say 3% to 7%. And I'm just -- as you look forward and as that gap begins to narrow and they get to par with you, which, I think, they're starting trying to do in some categories, how do you respond to keep that customer coming back to Dollar General, that customer you've earned over the past few years? Just how do you guys react?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think -- by the way, your call out is right on. It's about what gap is. Now why were the gaps narrowing? We still significantly have some lead here yet. But I think at the end of the day, Chuck, if that were to happen, if that were to be parity down the road, if that were to happen, it will turn into an execution game. And that will be the ability for us to conceptually take what we've got and make sure it translates its way into the store, which, I think, most people will tell you that we're very good at. And I never, never want to sell short our ability in category management and the fact that we have one of the best category management programs around, and that's how you stay relevant. It's not just having the right price. You have to have the right items at the right time at the right price, and I happen to think we're very good at that.\n\n---\n\nOkay, I agree. And then the follow-up with that, one for David, just when you went through the components of the guidance in March, you guided EBITDA growth of, I believe, 2% to 5%. With presumably more buybacks front end-loaded than, I think, probably most people had in their models, it would appear to be that maybe the guide of the EBIT dollar growth would be at the lower end of that range. Is that kind of how the math plays out this year for you guys, or is it still at the midpoint of that range for the year?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think as we look at it, Chuck, and again, we're not giving specific numbers there, but the impact, if you put in the impact of the share buyback and you put it all together, I think the range on the operating profit growth, it's still -- if you look at that, it doesn't change it all that much from what we had said previously in terms of the high end of the guidance there. So it doesn't have a significant impact on that overall.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then just one more, just if I could, on new store productivity. It was, on our math, around 74%, which is a little bit lower than what you guys have been running. I didn't know if there was some late in the quarter openings that kind of maybe pushed that number down or if you were seeing something else that led it to be only 74%.\n\n---\n\nNo, I mean, we historically said it's in the 85% to 90% range, and I'm pretty comfortable with that number, Chuck.\n\n---\n\nSo let me ask you about discretionary sales trend here. So the sequential improvement you've seen, how broad-based is that? And have we turned positive yet in discretionary comps? And do you think that -- can you consistently grow that business with the low-end consumer stressed the way they are?\n\n---\n\nThe improvement that we started seeing in April and into May is broad-based across all the categories, and it's fair to say that non-consumables are running positive. Now there's puts and takes in there, but we are running positive in non-consumables.\n\n---\n\nAs a group.\n\n---\n\nYes, but I would say if you look at all the categories within there, it's probably as close as it's been in a long time in terms of the boat is floating pretty evenly. And more importantly, John, it's been -- we've got a great team that's working really hard on it. It's taken us a while. I still believe the non-consumable side of the business is incredibly important to us, and I actually believe that's how we'll grow the basket long term. And I think the trouble with non-consumable stuff, with your extensive retail background, it takes a while for your initiative to gain traction, where the consumer comes in and actually sees something different, something new. And that, I think, is actually what's starting to happen.\n\n---\n\nSo could we actually -- or you think about -- not really to think about holiday, you think about the setup, right, the easy compare, weather, the calendar, et cetera, are you more optimistic about going in a holiday than you've been in a while, a couple of years?\n\n---\n\nI think, again, if I had Vasos with me, he would tell you the offering we have for Christmas is pretty doggone strong, and it's built around affordability. It is going to be a very interesting holiday for us. Having said that, we'll talk more about that probably as we get a little bit closer to it.\n\n---\n\nAnd let me -- and then you didn't really talk much about tobacco attachment metrics. Have they continued to improve sequentially?\n\n---\n\nYes. I'll give you the latest cut I've got on it, John. 31% of our cigarette purchases are cigarettes only. 27% are tobacco plus 1 or 2 items. But the big number now is 42% of tobacco purchases have 3 or more items. So it's continuing to move exactly as we projected, and should say and the basket's growing with it.\n\n---\n\nI was going to say based on that, is there any clever way to get more than your fair share of the CVS customers? Or not really, you just got to -- they'll come in if you're close to their store?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think the trouble when someone gives up something like that, it's going to go a little bit of everywhere. And I think what we have do, John, is just let that play out and see what actually happens.\n\n---\n\nJust had a question on inventory shrink. This is the first quarter in a while that you haven't specifically called out inventory shrink as a headwind to your gross margin. So I just wanted to make sure that you are seeing inventory shrink improvements, and to the extent that you are, what is driving that?\n\n---\n\nYes, we didn't call it out because it wasn't significant enough to be called out. But it's still a little bit of a headwind for us as we look at shrink and where we'd like to be versus where we had planned it to be, but again, not enough to be called out as it was in some previous quarters overall. We continue to have quite an effort going on in terms of things that we're doing with our defensive merchandising, our corkscrew pegs, our anti-sweep pegs. A lot of new thoughts in terms of additional things we'll be doing, particularly when it comes to DSD and some of the more high-shrink items that we have there. So stay tuned there. So again, still not ready to declare victory there, but making progress. A little bit negative, but not enough to call out like it was in prior quarters.\n\n---\n\nProbably from a headwind to a breeze, right?\n\n---\n\nGot it. Just to clarify then, so it's still a headwind, not as much of a headwind as it's been in the past. Is that a fair assessment?\n\n---\n\nYes. Again, we didn't feel the need to call it out. In the past, it was significant enough that we felt like we needed to call it out.\n\n---\n\nI guess 1 -- 2 quick questions. One was more kind of functional. I was wondering, the digital couponing that you're going to be doing, can you give a little more color? I guess I'm not clear exactly what you're doing and how that customer is going to access that. Is it just via their phones or, I guess, computer? How is that going to work functionally?\n\n---\n\nYes, so what happens, Joe, you can either go into the store, or you can go into our website on your laptop, and all you do is you sign in with a reference number. Most people probably put their phone number in there. And once you sign in, you opt in, you can look at the assortment of coupons and say, geez, I want these or you can just check the all box. And then what we will do is we'll download those onto your smartphone. You'll go in, check out, key in your number, and then those coupons will be subtracted from your purchases. It is pretty slick. It's kind of like a loyalty card without all the expense.\n\n---\n\nRight. And then do you guys have -- and you have enough of a database, or I guess it will build as you start the program?\n\n---\n\nAbsolutely. So what will happen is we'll begin to be able to link purchases to a phone number or groups of phone numbers and be able to market against those.\n\n---\n\nGot it. And then the one last question I had, sort of bigger picture. But as you guys look at your 11,000-plus stores, can you see any differences based on, I guess, for lack of a better word, quality of the store, the demographic, like the stores that are in better markets or better demographic areas versus those that are in the weaker ones? Like do you see a range of -- are people buying different things? Are there just any subtle differences that you can share with us just to get a better sense of where the customer is at?\n\n---\n\nJoe, this is one of the most interesting businesses I have ever dealt with in that the SKU base is so limited and so narrow and so relevant that it pretty much -- it's pretty even just about everywhere, regardless of the demographic. And that's why we've been so successful, with every region in the United States historically trends positive because the model is so basic.\n\n---\n\nAll right, operator, that -- I think, Brandi, that will conclude our call at this point. Thank you, everyone, for joining us. I know we left a few people in the queue, so please feel free to give me a call today or Emma Joe a call. And we look forward to updating you as we move through the year.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Scot Ciccarelli (Analysts)】\nCan you help provide some more color around the price investments, across what percent of the store, maybe number of SKUs? Obviously, Rick, you've been talking about for a while how it's become a much more competitive environment. So just trying to get an idea around those price investments that we're talking about, especially given the fact that your biggest competitor -- direct competitor is also talking about more price investments.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nYes, Scot, here is how we're looking at this. First off, as I look at the competitive environment, while the competitive environment is intense, it is no more intense than it was when we were in the fourth quarter. It's just kind of remains more at an elevated level. It's not like people are doing silly things out there. The second thing in regards to our major competitor out there, I think it's fair to say they're moving down towards us. I don't think there should be any worry that they're attempting to get under us. I haven't seen anything to indicate that at this time. And then in regards to the investments we're making, and I want to reiterate our commitment to EDLP, as we moved into April and into May, some of the high-traffic, high-penetration items that we've seen in the ad, we made the decision to place them in our ad also. And by the way, when I say that, a handful of items. And you can't -- our environment, you can't operate where a competitor has a better price in an ad -- when you're in the ad with the same item. So a handful of selective items across consumable categories. And again, no major change, no major change in the competitive environment and not seeing many changes at all in our price as it relates to where we are against drug, mass or grocery.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scot Ciccarelli (Analysts)】\nGot it. And then Rick, you did talk about kind of private label and private label food. I mean, historically, you guys talked about there's a lot of brand sensitivity around anything that customers were going to put in or on their bodies, I think, was the phrase. Are the customers now at the point where they're becoming more interested in private label food products?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nAbsolutely, and that's falls to the affordability thing. The private brand, the gap we have in private brand against national brands is pretty significant. And I think, Scot, that provides a wonderful trade-down opportunity for our customers. Then you couple that with the work we're doing on SKUs that are between $1 and $5 across the store, and you're getting a pretty powerful one-two punch directed at affordability.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matthew Boss (Analysts)】\nSo as we think about EBIT dollars, guidance this year is low to mid-single-digit growth. That includes the incentive and health care expense build. As we think multiyear, how do you -- do you think this is a mid-teens bottom line algorithm model? Or what's the best way to think about the P&L going forward?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Tehle (Executives)】\nYes, this is David. We're not giving long-term guidance at this point. But when we gave our guidance back in March, we felt it was important to point out certain specific items that were hitting the P&L that we believe were more temporary in nature, and you called out some of those. And obviously, we've put them in our press release back in March. So clearly, once you get by those items, you get into a more normalized growth rate if you look at the bottom line of Dollar General. So I think getting by those items is important in terms of understanding our story as we move forward to the future.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matthew Boss (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then as a follow-up, is sales per square foot approaching about $200 here? How would you rank the productivity opportunities going forward, and how do you see your ability to continue to march this metric higher over time?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nYes, Matt, I'll take that one. One of the metrics that I'm most proud of is where we are in square footage, sales per square foot. We've started about $163 in January of '08. We're actually at $220 now. And I believe we have -- there's still opportunity there. I can't look at you and say, hey, it's going to be $250 or $270. As we continue to refine our mix, maximize category management, believe it or not, it's one of the metrics we look at the hardest, and we still think we've got room to grow it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Binder (Analysts)】\nMy question was around your initiative with regard to taking price points down. I'm just curious, based on what you've seen in April and May, if you can talk a little bit about what's happening with AUR, UPT, frequency, maybe break it down a little bit for us. And also, if you could just comment on whether these are similar-type margin items as you had before, or is that changing as well?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nYes. And first of all, I don't want anybody to think we're out there lowering a lot of prices. Our EDLP position has got us incredibly strong as it relates to our competition out there. What we have done, Dan, is taken some items in the ad and trued them up with what's going on around us, right? And again, I think it's really important that I don't want anyone to think the competitive environment has changed radically in the course of the last 1.5 quarters. Our average unit retail is slightly down, and it's driven primarily probably by a little bit of deflation that we're seeing in cereals, grain items, sugar, oil, and we don't have offsetting categories because of our limited amount of SKUs in the store to offset that. And in regards to these new items, $1 to $5, I would say, quite frankly, they probably carry margin rates that are very similar to what we normally deal with. And in some cases, sometimes, the lower-value SKUs actually carry a little more margin.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Edward Kelly (Analysts)】\nQuick question for you just I guess, maybe to start on the commentary around the comp performance. You obviously mentioned that things improved in April or May. Is there any more color you can give us there? I was just curious as to whether you're, at this point, kind of in line with the full year guidance, or do you need to still drive a continued improvement from here in order to get to that number, particularly as we think about cycling tobacco?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nLet me tell you -- let me answer it this way. If I looked how I felt where I'm sitting right now in quarter 4 or quarter 1, where I was sitting in the quarter, I feel a whole lot better today. So I think we have seen improving trends the minute the weather changed, so I think we're on track.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Edward Kelly (Analysts)】\nAnd Rick, if I remember correctly, last quarter, you talked about expecting some improvement in the promotional environment, I guess, throughout the year and how that was sort of factored into how you were thinking about things. Is that still the case, or are you now relying more on sort of like internal initiatives to...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nYes, a very fair question, Ed. I actually thought, as the weather would improve, that the promotional environment would level off, and that hasn't happened. And we've made a decision on a handful of select items where we need to do the right thing for our customer. We've done that. But the key takeaway is we have not abandoned our commitment to EDLP. I want to make sure everybody understands we are managing this thing, and I did think the promotional activity would slow down. It's not any worse, but on the same token, we're not going to wait around until it does.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Stephen Grambling (Analysts)】\nI guess one quick follow-up to Ed's question on the guidance there. I guess just to be clear, is the expectation that some of the price investments that you're making on gross margin will basically be balanced by some of the cost control initiatives you have put in place? It sounded like they're incremental to what we discussed in the fourth quarter.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nYes, I think it's fair to say that we're working on cost and working on our margin like we always have. And right now, our #1 emphasis -- our #1 priority is same-store sales growth. And we're seeing -- we started seeing a momentum shift in April, and we're intent, Steve, on keeping that moving.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Stephen Grambling (Analysts)】\nAnd then I guess a separate question, which is one of your competitors who -- Family Dollar announced some store closings going on and also slower store growth openings. How do you think about the opportunity there from a market share standpoint and even real estate selection going forward?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nYes, really, really solid question. We look at our real estate returns every week, look at our projects. We're opening our stores in that 85% to 90% of our same-store sales base. As I look at our pro forma and how we're actually performing we're at about 101%, I believe, actually doing just a little bit better. I actually think that the slowing down of growth in our competitor will lead to better real estate values for us, hopefully, down the road because there'll be less people fighting over a site.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Stephen Grambling (Analysts)】\nAnd in terms of the closings, do you have any sense for the market share opportunity there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nI think that they're scattered all over, and I think we're going to have -- it's kind of like CVS abandoning cigarettes. I think that's one of those things we're going to have let it play out.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Wewer (Analysts)】\nSo Rick, when you joined the company, a Dollar General store averaged about $170,000 of inventory. And over the following 3 or 4 years, you grew that to about $200,000 per store, and your GMROI increased every year as well. But since 2011, another $30,000 of inventory has been added, but GMROI has dropped for 8 consecutive quarters. So I guess my question is how important is inventory productivity when you're looking at strategic plans? And then particularly, when you're looking at the changes in your private label, mix, pricing, how will that impact GMROI going forward?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nYes, I think, Dan, as I look at this, I think that's, again, a really solid observation. And I think if you look over the last couple of years, in our desire to become more and more relevant, we added more and more SKUs that, quite frankly, weren't turning as fast as we thought they were going to. And I think it was about this time last year, I actually admitted not only were they not turning as fast, but they were actually creating incremental shrink. And we have begun the process now of -- we've taken now over 600 of those slower-turn items that were creating shrink. In fact, I think we're just about complete with that process. And we get it without incremental markdowns involved. Well, I got tongue-tied there for a minute. So to answer your question, I think if you go back to when I first got here, the fruit was much lower on the ground. It was easier to say we needed this and we needed this and we needed this. Now what happens as we fine-tune our mix, we're going to have to be a little more select going forward. And I think what we should see, as we add more SKUs in the $1 to $5 range, if the affordability strategy works, we should see our inventory turns increase.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Wewer (Analysts)】\nOkay. And just also one follow-up, maybe for David. We normally don't give too much attention to company guidance, but I did notice that you're not providing a second quarter guidance, which is, in past quarters, you did provide upcoming guidance. Was there a reason for the omission?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Tehle (Executives)】\nYes, that's really not a change from the past, Dan. In first quarter -- I mean, in fourth quarter, when we were laying out guidance for the year, we did give some first quarter guidance because there were a lot of ins and outs, and it was very complicated. But if you go back since we went public in 2009, our goal was to give guidance for the full year and try to steer people to that full year guidance and, on a quarterly basis, update the full year guidance. And there may have been select time periods over the last 5 years where we'll comment on a particular quarter. And certainly, as we get through the third quarter and we're talking about the rest of year, there's only one quarter left, so by definition, we're giving quarterly guidance. But in general, we have not given quarterly guidance, and that's not our intent. Again, we'd like to have our investors focus more on the long-term opportunity with Dollar General than the individual quarters.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Mann (Analysts)】\nIn terms of gross margin, I think you talked about second quarter, perhaps, getting a little bit better. The first quarter would have been the worst of the year. Given the environment and what you're doing with some pricing, do you still expect that to be the case? And any other puts and takes that you could call out would be appreciated.\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Tehle (Executives)】\nYes, David, we're not giving specific guidance on gross margin, but let me try to help you a little bit with it. And we tried to spell this out in the fourth quarter, when we were talking about the full year and we gave a little more color on some line items. I think we still think that as we get into the back half of the year and we lap tobacco because the rollout last year ended in the June, July time frame, that we should see the comparisons get a little bit easier on the gross margin. To your point, we still haven't reached that in the second quarter, so there still is pressure, more pressure on the margin in the second quarter than what we'll see the back half of the year as we get to the third quarter and the fourth quarter.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Mann (Analysts)】\nGreat. And then as a follow-up, in terms of Family Dollar, when you look at what they've done in the past quarter in terms of taking some price -- or putting through some price investments, how have your stores performed that are near the Family Dollar stores versus the other stores that you have that are not in direct competition with them?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nDavid, I'm not seeing anything different anywhere across the chain.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Trussell (Analysts)】\nJust a question regarding the food and consumable categories. Your sales growth was just under 8% this quarter, so you're clearly continuing to gain market share. But that was also the third consecutive quarter of a sequential slowdown in that growth line. I'm just hoping you can speak a little bit more about overall demand of those goods, those basic household goods, and contrast that to all the meaningful additional shelf space that's being allocated across the industry to those products.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nI think, Paul, as you look at the Nielsen numbers, they would actually tell you that the pie is contracting a little bit. And it's hard to believe that people are eating less or using less detergent, but apparently, they all are at the end of the day. And in fact, we actually have market research that talks about how people are trying to stretch 1 meal into 2 by adding more starch to the product. I think -- and I literally looked at this information last night, literally looked at this last night. The new Nielsen numbers are out. And on a 4-week basis and a 12-week basis, our unit share growth and share growth are accelerating. And I take that as a sign that we are -- the mix we have in the stores, the allocation of product base, how it is on the store is still the right thing to do.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mary Winn Pilkington (Executives)】\nPaul, does that help you?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Trussell (Analysts)】\nNo, that's helpful. And then just to follow up, in terms of the color you're giving on gross margin, just to reiterate, in the second half of the year, as you cycle tobacco, are you comfortable, given your initiatives, that gross margins will be flat to up in the second half?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Tehle (Executives)】\nYes. Again, we're not giving specific guidance on what we're seeing in gross margin. But we do see it getting better than what we saw in the first half of the year, in particular, as we get to third and fourth quarter, better than what we will see in first and second quarter.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Mushkin (Analysts)】\nSo I was wondering, Rick, of your take on Walmart's Dollar General strategy as they're talking about it, which is to basically open up some of these Express stores next to DGs, and how the stores performed when you're seeing that activity. And is there anything that you think, as they go from a test to a full-out roll here they're going to do 100 stores this year, that you're going to need to do?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nYes, I think Walmart is an outstanding competitor, I mean, the largest retailer in the United States. We have experienced Express stores where our stores -- they've been opened up against us. I can tell you, in every instance where that has happened, after 1 year, the stores are comping positive, so it's not like there's this major knockout punch here. I do think that when we take the hit when a Walmart Express opens up, it's no different than with another competitor would open up. So I could actually make an argument if I get them all and just gave you an average, it might even be less. I do think that it's -- the small-box is -- I think it's a different animal to operate in terms of the supply chain. We ship in eaches and rolltainers versus pallets and truckloads. And I think there's a lot more work there that needs to be done. I mean, albeit -- Scott, we do have a nice head start, too, if you look at 11,000 stores out there. So I think they're a great competitor. I think they've done a lot of fantastic things, but I also think -- we're going to open up 700 new stores this year. We're going to enter some new markets next year. So I think we feel pretty good about where we are.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Mushkin (Analysts)】\nI actually agree with some of your comments about Walmart. Fresh in Dollar General, a lot of our research suggests that the fresh trends are fairly significant and that some of these packaged food, you were talking about the Nielsen data earlier, that that maybe switch -- some people switching to fresh. How does Dollar General deal with the trend for what looks like all consumers, even low-end consumers, to buy more fresh?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nYes, I think one of the things we're wrestling at is -- and I use fresh to mean also more organic, right, as well as just fresh produce and fresh meat. I do think that our customer is becoming a little more receptive to the organic and the fat free. I can tell you, Scott, when I got here 4 or 5 years ago, they actually thought that product cost more. And it probably did now, and now it's actually coming down on the retail. I do know Todd and his team are looking at that. As far as moving into true fresh, true produce, true meat, that's a little more difficult animal to manage. And the key to us has always been that 7,500 to 10,000 SKUs that are core everyday use and I think will continue to fit well with the people who are really pushing the fresh stuff.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Meredith Adler (Analysts)】\nI'd like to start by just talking about stock buybacks, and I don't know whether you'll add any more, but you did borrow a bit in the first quarter to buy back stock. And as you said, it ended up with leverage that was a little bit higher. If the stock were to stay depressed, would you be willing to go beyond $1.1 billion of stock repurchases? Would you be willing to stay somewhat leveraged or push leverage up a little bit? It seems like the $800 million that you spent so far, you probably got -- did well in terms of where you bought the stock. Would you take advantage of that later in the year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Tehle (Executives)】\nMeredith, this is David. Our target right now today is still to buy back $1.1 billion of stock. And we have said many times that given conditions in the debt and equity markets, we can temporarily change our thoughts on that, change our debt levels. And we did so in Q1, accelerating our purchases due to what we saw in the stock price. And we believe, on a long-term basis, this is very positive for all of our shareholders, particularly our longer-term shareholders. So Rick and I continuously discuss this with our board, but as of right now, the $1.1 billion is kind of where we're locked and loaded on.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Meredith Adler (Analysts)】\nOkay, great. And then sort of changing gears, these $1 to $5 items and some of the other things that you've been doing to provide a better value, an opening price point in many categories, to what extent would you say that you're getting support from vendors? To what extent are they actually coming up with ideas or being very supportive on developing products and helping to manufacture them? Is this something you guys are mostly doing on your own?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nYes, actually, Meredith, to be honest, that is combination of both. I think the affordability idea, which we will probably start hearing more about, initiated from our market research and the work that's being done here. While those are manufacturer items, they're more also what I would quantify as in-and-out items, right, like a different brand, an old brand that we are now resurrecting. So it's really a combination of both. But I will tell you, if Todd was sitting here in the room with me, he would say that the vendor community is much more receptive to this kind of thinking than they ever have been in the past.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Meredith Adler (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then I just have one final question about real estate. I mean, somebody already asked you about not having as much competition for real estate from your most similar competitor. But in just more generally, what are you seeing in the real estate environment? Any pressure on rate -- rents and any shortages anywhere? Or do you just still have tons of choice?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nYes. Well, I think the signal here that's the most obvious is we're already ahead of the 2014 pipeline. We've already moved into the 2015 pipeline, which would tell you the availability of the real estate is as strong as it's been the last couple of years. I would say right now, there might be some minus upward pressure in specific pieces of the country. But overall, I would tell you the rates that we're negotiating for are very consistent with what we've got in the last couple of years. In fact, I could actually tell you we're doing better in California.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Meredith Adler (Analysts)】\nThat's great. I hear good things about the real estate you're picking in California. Congratulations.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nYes, we've come a long way on the California thing. We're starting to get really, really excited.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matt Nemer (Analysts)】\nMy first question is actually on the apparel business. It looked like there was some nice sequential improvement from Q4. It's still down per foot. But I'm just wondering if you're getting traction from merchandising changes there or it some of that's driven by markdowns.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nIt's absolutely driven by merchandising. We are, Matt, like I said in my script, we're very pleased with what we're seeing on the non-consumable side, and you haven't heard me say that in a long time.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matt Nemer (Analysts)】\nAnything in particular in apparel that's causing that change? It's like a 9 point change Q4 to...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nYes, I would tell you, and again, I never thought I'd say this, women's hanging apparel and shoes are both doing very well. And what's happening is it's starting to drag -- the halo effect is starting to drag men's with it. Now there's been a lot of hard work done on men's, too, but we're pleased with what we're seeing.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matt Nemer (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then just secondly, the digital coupon strategy that you mentioned, how does that impact the P&L? And does it replace any circular marketing expense? Could you just explain kind of how that might play out over time?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nYes, Matt, it's all -- it's driven by manufacturer expense. It's all the FSI coupons that you historically see in the Sunday newspaper. We're going to take all of that digital. And then, of course, sooner or later, we'll probably add some DG offers along with it, but there'll be no P&L hit with the implementation of the program.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Grom (Analysts)】\nJust looking back, Rick, part of your success since you became CEO has been the price lead and kind of adopting the Costco philosophy on everyday low price, and I think we'd all agree that that's been the right formula. And I believe some of our price work on others would show that the lead relative to FDO got pretty wide the past few years, and some studies say 3% to 7%. And I'm just -- as you look forward and as that gap begins to narrow and they get to par with you, which, I think, they're starting trying to do in some categories, how do you respond to keep that customer coming back to Dollar General, that customer you've earned over the past few years? Just how do you guys react?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nYes, I think -- by the way, your call out is right on. It's about what gap is. Now why were the gaps narrowing? We still significantly have some lead here yet. But I think at the end of the day, Chuck, if that were to happen, if that were to be parity down the road, if that were to happen, it will turn into an execution game. And that will be the ability for us to conceptually take what we've got and make sure it translates its way into the store, which, I think, most people will tell you that we're very good at. And I never, never want to sell short our ability in category management and the fact that we have one of the best category management programs around, and that's how you stay relevant. It's not just having the right price. You have to have the right items at the right time at the right price, and I happen to think we're very good at that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Grom (Analysts)】\nOkay, I agree. And then the follow-up with that, one for David, just when you went through the components of the guidance in March, you guided EBITDA growth of, I believe, 2% to 5%. With presumably more buybacks front end-loaded than, I think, probably most people had in their models, it would appear to be that maybe the guide of the EBIT dollar growth would be at the lower end of that range. Is that kind of how the math plays out this year for you guys, or is it still at the midpoint of that range for the year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Tehle (Executives)】\nYes, I think as we look at it, Chuck, and again, we're not giving specific numbers there, but the impact, if you put in the impact of the share buyback and you put it all together, I think the range on the operating profit growth, it's still -- if you look at that, it doesn't change it all that much from what we had said previously in terms of the high end of the guidance there. So it doesn't have a significant impact on that overall.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Grom (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then just one more, just if I could, on new store productivity. It was, on our math, around 74%, which is a little bit lower than what you guys have been running. I didn't know if there was some late in the quarter openings that kind of maybe pushed that number down or if you were seeing something else that led it to be only 74%.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nNo, I mean, we historically said it's in the 85% to 90% range, and I'm pretty comfortable with that number, Chuck.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Heinbockel (Analysts)】\nSo let me ask you about discretionary sales trend here. So the sequential improvement you've seen, how broad-based is that? And have we turned positive yet in discretionary comps? And do you think that -- can you consistently grow that business with the low-end consumer stressed the way they are?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nThe improvement that we started seeing in April and into May is broad-based across all the categories, and it's fair to say that non-consumables are running positive. Now there's puts and takes in there, but we are running positive in non-consumables.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Heinbockel (Analysts)】\nAs a group.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nYes, but I would say if you look at all the categories within there, it's probably as close as it's been in a long time in terms of the boat is floating pretty evenly. And more importantly, John, it's been -- we've got a great team that's working really hard on it. It's taken us a while. I still believe the non-consumable side of the business is incredibly important to us, and I actually believe that's how we'll grow the basket long term. And I think the trouble with non-consumable stuff, with your extensive retail background, it takes a while for your initiative to gain traction, where the consumer comes in and actually sees something different, something new. And that, I think, is actually what's starting to happen.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Heinbockel (Analysts)】\nSo could we actually -- or you think about -- not really to think about holiday, you think about the setup, right, the easy compare, weather, the calendar, et cetera, are you more optimistic about going in a holiday than you've been in a while, a couple of years?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nI think, again, if I had Vasos with me, he would tell you the offering we have for Christmas is pretty doggone strong, and it's built around affordability. It is going to be a very interesting holiday for us. Having said that, we'll talk more about that probably as we get a little bit closer to it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Heinbockel (Analysts)】\nAnd let me -- and then you didn't really talk much about tobacco attachment metrics. Have they continued to improve sequentially?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nYes. I'll give you the latest cut I've got on it, John. 31% of our cigarette purchases are cigarettes only. 27% are tobacco plus 1 or 2 items. But the big number now is 42% of tobacco purchases have 3 or more items. So it's continuing to move exactly as we projected, and should say and the basket's growing with it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Heinbockel (Analysts)】\nI was going to say based on that, is there any clever way to get more than your fair share of the CVS customers? Or not really, you just got to -- they'll come in if you're close to their store?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nYes, I think the trouble when someone gives up something like that, it's going to go a little bit of everywhere. And I think what we have do, John, is just let that play out and see what actually happens.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Anthony Chukumba (Analysts)】\nJust had a question on inventory shrink. This is the first quarter in a while that you haven't specifically called out inventory shrink as a headwind to your gross margin. So I just wanted to make sure that you are seeing inventory shrink improvements, and to the extent that you are, what is driving that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Tehle (Executives)】\nYes, we didn't call it out because it wasn't significant enough to be called out. But it's still a little bit of a headwind for us as we look at shrink and where we'd like to be versus where we had planned it to be, but again, not enough to be called out as it was in some previous quarters overall. We continue to have quite an effort going on in terms of things that we're doing with our defensive merchandising, our corkscrew pegs, our anti-sweep pegs. A lot of new thoughts in terms of additional things we'll be doing, particularly when it comes to DSD and some of the more high-shrink items that we have there. So stay tuned there. So again, still not ready to declare victory there, but making progress. A little bit negative, but not enough to call out like it was in prior quarters.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nProbably from a headwind to a breeze, right?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Anthony Chukumba (Analysts)】\nGot it. Just to clarify then, so it's still a headwind, not as much of a headwind as it's been in the past. Is that a fair assessment?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Tehle (Executives)】\nYes. Again, we didn't feel the need to call it out. In the past, it was significant enough that we felt like we needed to call it out.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Joseph Feldman (Analysts)】\nI guess 1 -- 2 quick questions. One was more kind of functional. I was wondering, the digital couponing that you're going to be doing, can you give a little more color? I guess I'm not clear exactly what you're doing and how that customer is going to access that. Is it just via their phones or, I guess, computer? How is that going to work functionally?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nYes, so what happens, Joe, you can either go into the store, or you can go into our website on your laptop, and all you do is you sign in with a reference number. Most people probably put their phone number in there. And once you sign in, you opt in, you can look at the assortment of coupons and say, geez, I want these or you can just check the all box. And then what we will do is we'll download those onto your smartphone. You'll go in, check out, key in your number, and then those coupons will be subtracted from your purchases. It is pretty slick. It's kind of like a loyalty card without all the expense.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Joseph Feldman (Analysts)】\nRight. And then do you guys have -- and you have enough of a database, or I guess it will build as you start the program?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nAbsolutely. So what will happen is we'll begin to be able to link purchases to a phone number or groups of phone numbers and be able to market against those.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Joseph Feldman (Analysts)】\nGot it. And then the one last question I had, sort of bigger picture. But as you guys look at your 11,000-plus stores, can you see any differences based on, I guess, for lack of a better word, quality of the store, the demographic, like the stores that are in better markets or better demographic areas versus those that are in the weaker ones? Like do you see a range of -- are people buying different things? Are there just any subtle differences that you can share with us just to get a better sense of where the customer is at?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nJoe, this is one of the most interesting businesses I have ever dealt with in that the SKU base is so limited and so narrow and so relevant that it pretty much -- it's pretty even just about everywhere, regardless of the demographic. And that's why we've been so successful, with every region in the United States historically trends positive because the model is so basic.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mary Winn Pilkington (Executives)】\nAll right, operator, that -- I think, Brandi, that will conclude our call at this point. Thank you, everyone, for joining us. I know we left a few people in the queue, so please feel free to give me a call today or Emma Joe a call. And we look forward to updating you as we move through the year.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you, Sally [ph], and welcome to Johnson Matthey's presentation of the results for our year ended 31st of March 2014. And before I start, I've got an introduction to make. We've got a newcomer. It's Den Jones, our new FD, starts work today. So those of you who don't know him, there he is. I'm sure you'll make his acquaintance into the future.\r\nSo usual format from us: a quick introduction from me, one slide; then move into the financial review from Robert; and then we'll go through each of the divisions, I'll do that. And then we'll spare some time at the end to handle your questions.\r\nWe had a really good year in 2013, '14. Now sales were up strongly, and so was our underlying EPS. And growth came across all of our 5 divisions, but of particular note was a very strong performance from ECT. We've continued to invest in our business, particularly the R&D where we've increased spend again by another 12%, but also you'll have heard some extra manufacturing capacity in ECT and in PT, of large investments in more capacity. And so look forward into 2014, '15, we expect to be broadly in line with last year, but that's because we've got some really strong underlying growth in profits because we've got some headwinds. We've got -- the first thing is the lack of an Anglo contract, which you know about, which is a kind of GBP 30 million headwind. And then we've got some adverse effects from currency, which is another GBP 20 million headwind. So double-digit underlying growth in profits for this business going forward. And as we always say, we're particularly well positioned for long-term growth in this business.\r\nSo with that, let me hand over to Robert.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Neil. And good morning, everybody.\r\nAs normal, I will just go through some of the financial metrics. So looking first at the underlying results, Neil has already said sales up 11%, profits up 14% and earnings per share by 16%. These are all the underlying numbers. And within this, you can see operating profit grew 13%, slightly higher than the growth in sales. Obviously, that's an improvement in margins. That will probably drop a bit this year because of the loss of the Anglo contract, which was a high-margin business, as you know.\r\nForeign exchange didn't really make much of an impact on us this year, the year we just reported. So these numbers, in the difference between the actual numbers and constant currency numbers, aren't much different, but as Neil has already said, roughly, if the rates stay the same, there'll be a GBP 20 million adverse hit for this year that we're now in. The biggest impact on that is dollars, and then after that, it's euros and renminbi. Those are the 3 big ones, and together, they make up nearly GBP 18 million. Then in the other currencies, the tail is the extra GBP 2 million or GBP 3 million that gets us just around the GBP 20 million number.\r\nLooking at interest. Interest went up a lot this year, partly because of higher pension interest charges. As you know, that's the way we have to account for it nowadays, but also we had some prefunding of our debt. We borrowed some money earlier than we needed because we took advantage of low interest rates, and that cost us about GBP 1.5 million, and that obviously won't recur in the year we're in now.\r\nLooking at tax rate. Tax rate for this year was 19.4% on the group on underlying numbers. The U.K. tax rate for the year we just finished was 23%, so a little over 3% below the headline rate. As you know, the U.K. rate is going to drop from 23% in the year we just finished to 21% this year and we still will have at least 3% below that, and then it will drop to 20% next year. Those have all been enacted.\r\nAnd finally on this slide, looking at the dividend. We've grown the dividend 10% this year, slightly below the rate in underlying earnings per share. Dividend cover of 2.7x, so we've grown the cover a bit. We've done that. As you know, the board wants to have a progressive dividend policy. And we have taken into account the fact that, this year, we're going to lose the Anglo contract, but we want to have that progressive dividend going forward. Right about a cover around 2.5x on average is what we're looking to do.\r\nWithin the underlying profit numbers, you can see on this slide there's a couple of one-offs. Pension gains, I'll talk a little bit about in a few slides time. It's just over GBP 10 million, which is spread across the business, as you can see. And then the closure costs of one of our businesses in Precious Metal Products, one of our old ceramic color products businesses, and that cost us GBP 8 million within Precious Metal Products. Both of these items are one-off items, though.\r\nJust a small note on corporate costs, up a bit more than last year, right about 1.1% of sales, and that's -- it's been around 1.1% of sales for many, many years. As the business is growing, we need to increase the costs in the corporate center just delivering the growth that we've got across the group. And last year was a bit of an anomaly really because of -- sorry, I didn't mean the year we just finished, the year before that, where we didn't meet our end-year profit targets.\r\nTurning now to cash. Good cash flow performance in the year, particularly well driven by improvement in working capital. Working capital days, down from 53 to 45. Huge amount of efforts going on, particularly in ECT where they've done really, really well on managing working capital. No one particular silver bullet. This is a whole pile of initiatives across the division. I think 45 is probably a really good number, and I think right about 50 is probably where we should be targeting, but hopefully, we can keep that continued performance on keeping the working capital days down.\r\nNet debt, down GBP 100 million to GBP 729 million. And with the reduction in pension numbers that I talked about and I can talk about a bit more later, our net debt-to-EBITDA is currently at 1.3x, so slightly outside our range, which as you know is 1.5x to 2x, but not that far away really.\r\nTurning now to cash flow conversion. So this is how we turn our profit into cash, and you can see, down slightly, 82% compared to 85% last year. And the principal driver for this was the continued growth in CapEx. And we expect that to continue, and that will keep our cash flow conversion around about 75%, maybe 80%, in the next few years.\r\nReturn on capital, also good, nicely ahead of our target, which is 20%, which is we keep that target of 20%, we're not changing that despite the change in the Anglo arrangements, driven by particularly good performance in ECT. Why did they do so well? Partly because of the very good growth in profit but partly because of that working capital improvement I mentioned. Slightly lower in Precious Metal Products division, again partly because of the Anglo contract reduction in profit, but also because we had at the end of the year some higher metal inventories. And the reason for that, of course, is as you know, the supply disruptions in South Africa. From an insurance point of view, we wanted to increase our metal inventory levels to make sure we satisfy our customers' demands.\r\nCapital expenditure, nearly GBP 220 million last year. Big projects in ECT: We've told you about in U.K. and Macedonia ahead of the new legislation, which is now in place or coming in place in the U.K. too. Expansion of additives capacity in the U.S., which is now complete, which is we bought this business in INTERCAT a few years ago. We've now been expanding the capacity there in our additives business.\r\nSo CapEx depreciation just about 1.7x. I think that we'll stay around that sort of level for the next couple of years, with CapEx around about GBP 240 million this year. So slightly more CapEx, but of course, the depreciation has gone up a little bit too, which is why the CapEx depreciation number stays fairly similar. And most of the CapEx or a lot -- a larger portion of the CapEx going forward is going to be in Process Technologies, as I think Geoff explained to you at the Capital Markets Day a few months ago.\r\nNow finally for me, looking at the pension schemes, you can see that the deficits have gone down quite a long way, partly driven by lower discounts -- sorry, higher discount rates and some ongoing derisking. Particularly, derisking that we've done, I talked a little bit already about the curtailment gains. That's -- that GBP 10 million is spread across the various divisions. We closed the U.S. scheme to new entrants and did a few other things as well, which I can explain if you want more detail, and those gave us these one-off gains. But we're now getting to a stage where we're narrowing down the sort of range of potential outcomes of these pension schemes. The volatility is becoming much less. But we did put GBP 27 million in last year to fund the deficits in both of these schemes, and we'd expect to put a similar level of cash flow in this year as well.\r\nWith that, I'll -- it's finished for me. I'll hand it back to Neil.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Robert.\r\nSo the operating review. As always, we'll start with ECT, emissions control technologies. Good set of numbers, as you can see: sales up 13%, operating profit up 25%. And I'd point to you that return on invested capital, which is a very strong number, 21%, so good effort on lots of fronts by ECT.\r\nECT exceeded our expectations for the year. And some of it was an improved product mix that we got in Europe. I think diesel sale -- car sales held up better than we were kind of expecting, and our share of those was strong. Good growth in our Asian businesses. And the implementation, of course, a highlight, which is the Euro VI legislation that benefited our HDD business in Europe. So the pie chart shows you the split of the sales. And interesting to note, 35% of our sales now are in HDD, whereas in 2006, probably that was 0. So exciting area for us.\r\nWe're dependent on car sales. Here, our car sales globally in the 3 regions and globally divided and analyzed in our financial year. So you can see some growth in North America and Asia but flat in our year in Europe, and global sales up 3-ish percent. But there are some signs of progress in car sales after many years of depressed car sales in Europe. Particularly, you can see that, half 2 of last year compared to half 2 of the year before, there's some glimmers of some growth, which is very welcome.\r\nSo here are our sales broken down by region for light duty catalyst. And you can see we've hit GBP 1 billion of total sales, up 8%, so we exceeded the growth in the market, which was 3-ish percent. North America broadly grew in line with the market. And in Europe, we outperformed the market. I've talked about the product mix, which has been a benefit, and the fact that diesel cars have maintained a reasonable share of the market, so a 5% growth in our sales in Europe. And a good growth, good strong growth in Asia. We've done pretty well in China. We've probably picked up some new business. And -- but also, in the rest of Southeast Asia, we've been doing well.\r\nSo operating profit, well ahead, and some good results from our process efficiency, Manufacturing Excellence and sustainability efforts that have really started to impact the cost side in ECT.\r\nHere's the outlook, as published by LMC Automotive. And you can see that global car sales will hit 100 million in a couple of years’ time and steady growth in all the markets. So I would think that the 2014 number in Europe might look a bit better than that by the time we get to the end of 2014.\r\nSo moving on to trucks, HDD truck sales and production, healthy markets. North America has grown well, as has Europe, year-on-year. And then second half on second half, yes, a bit of an acceleration really in sales of trucks in Europe and North America, so a healthy picture. And here are our sales: GBP 573 million of total sales in this area, up 20%. In North America, a reasonably good market. We grew in line with it. We're particularly well represented on Class 8 trucks, and they've picked up recently. But Europe has done also very well and has had the impact of the tighter legislation. Of course, the next year will show a full year of impact from tighter legislation. And just to give you a guide: Euro VI sales now in Europe, about 60% of the total sales.\r\nIn Asia, a big increase from a small-ish number. And as we suspected, the new legislation that's impacted China is not being fully implemented, but it's being implemented in about 10% of the potential cases, mainly in buses and in cities. We've got a good share of that business, as you can see. So continuing tightening legislation in Europe and China will benefit this business going forward. And we've got non-road sales, which are going to start to make an impact on the sales going forward.\r\nSo looking ahead for ECT. Well, the situation in Europe looks a bit better on cars, some car sales -- positive car sales data, which we haven't seen for a number of years. And the legislation is going to get tighter, so Euro 6b and c will add value to each car that we supply in the next couple of years. There's lots of talk about CO2 legislation and limits both in Europe and in North America, and they're broadly positive for us in that smaller engines are more complex designs, and that gives us an opportunity.\r\nSo in heavy duty, in the developed markets, as I've mentioned before, we're going to have a full year effect of the Euro VI legislation in Europe and a continued rollout of the non-road business. In developing markets, China is a focus for us. And we predicted a while ago that, when the Euro IV legislation arrived, it would take 4 or 5 or 6 years to be fully implemented, and that looks to us like how it's going to be. It's a lower-technology solution because it's only Euro IV and it's a little bit more competitive, but we're pretty happy with the share of that business that we've secured.\r\nProcess technology. Here are the key numbers. So sales up 11% and profits up 10%. Return on sales, steady. This was -- this division benefited from the addition of Formox, which we're very pleased to have added to the group. And if you strip out the sales of Formox, there was some growth in the rest of the division, particularly good performance in our Oil and Gas business. And you can see the split of sales there between Chemicals and oil and gas. But as we anticipated, our licensing sales have come out -- come down from a higher point in the previous few years and were lower at GBP 82 million.\r\nSo let's talk about the Chemicals business first. Here's the makeup of the GBP 339 million of sales that we make. Sales up 13%. Of course, that was benefited by the addition of Formox and formaldehyde catalysts and technology we're very pleased with. It's gone very well. Methanol did pretty well. And we signed 3 new SNG licenses in China. The Oleo/biochemicals side is -- did well in a fairly flat market. And in the Petrochemicals side, we've increased our catalyst volumes, but the licensing revenue is down, and you can see from that bar chart the effect. But important also to note here that, in 2013, we sold 5 oxo licenses that are particularly high earners for us in the oxo license; and this year, in 2014, only 1. But some SNG licenses were sold, but to note there that the SNG license sale benefits quite a lot off the catalyst sales side rather than the licensing income side.\r\nWe are developing some new technologies. The requirements for more and more oxo into the long-term future will sometime come to a bit of an end, but we have got some good new technologies in the pipeline. MEG and VCM are 2 of them.\r\nOil and Gas business has done pretty well. Sales grew 9%. There's an action in the refineries in the U.S. for the first time in a number of years, so that's boosted some hydrogen catalyst sales. You can see the split of the sales there. Gas Processing did well. And our Diagnostic Services business is also doing well on unconventional oil and gas opportunities in the U.S. and is adding some new technology to its portfolio for the analysis of the wall thickness of pipelines.\r\nSo looking ahead in PT. We do expect progress in the Chemicals side in 2014, '15, but we would flag that the timing of these orders, particularly for licenses, are really difficult to project exactly when they're going to hit us. We haven't lost any business, but the timing of orders is slightly uncertain. So it's not really appropriate to judge this business on 1 quarter of its performance. We're still continuing to develop our new technologies and the expansion of the petrochemical industry. So coal getting turned into products in China, that's a big driver for this business and that will continue. In the Oil and Gas area, we expect quite a robust year ahead, stronger demand from North American refineries and some opportunities coming up in the increased use of shale gas in the U.S., good drivers. So coal to products in China and shale gas in North America are key upsides to this business in the future.\r\nPrecious Metal Products. So a year of transition really for Precious Metal Products. Sales flat and profits up a little bit. So sales, in line with last year. You can see the split on that pie chart between the Services business and the Manufacturing businesses.\r\nSo you know the change in the Anglo Platinum arrangements will be an impact of about GBP 30 million in the coming year. And in the year past, there were some lower prices for precious metals, which had a bit of an impact; and some continued weaknesses, I have to say, in the industrial area in the Manufacturing businesses. Not all of them, but some of them are finding life a little tougher. And you've heard about the closure costs of part of our Color Technologies business, which really means our color technologies products now are all in the functional area rather than the decorative, which is where they came from many years ago.\r\nHere's the Services business data. Precious metal management sales, down 12%. Actually, Anglo American had a good first 9 months in the year and did better than we expected them to do, but that didn't offset the GBP 10 million hit, which was the 1 quarter's worth of the loss of the contract. There you can see the average prices, not a lot of movement there. And on the Refining business, sales were down a little bit. And in pgm refining and recycling, we had a slightly lower average basket price for pgms. Intake is pretty stable but the mix slightly less favorable. We're investing money in this area. It's a very strategically important area for us. We're the biggest pgm refiners of secondary material, and that's a very nice place to be when there's uncertainty in supply from the primary producers. There's the split of sales through the recycling side.\r\nIf we look now at the Manufacturing businesses. Sales up 11%, but actually, we've transferred in a little business out of ECT that was much better fit with PMD. So that boosted the sales by about GBP 24 million. Lower demand for nitric acid catalysts and N2O abatement technology on the industrial side but much better demand for the medical device components, where sales were up. Color tech did well. It's had a tough few years with lower car sales, particularly in Europe, but that's starting to do a lot better. And we've closed the decorative side. Chemical Products also did well on the back of ECT. They supply ECT with some raw materials in the precious metals side to make catalysts.\r\nLooking ahead. The impact from Anglo. Pgm Refining and Recycling currently looking a little bit better with slightly higher metal prices, volumes fairly stable. There is some increased competition here. The primary producers have got refineries which isn't having primary material go through them at the moment, so there are a little bit of increased competition here. And the surprise to us, I guess, is that the strikes in South Africa have -- so far have limited effect on the price. Mixed outlook for the Manufacturing businesses on the industrial side but growth in the medical business.\r\nFine Chemicals. Good year for fine chems, sales up, profits up 10%, pretty steady performance. There's the split of the sales between the API Manufacturing business, the catalyst and chiral tech and the Research Chemicals. And return on sales has benefited here from the higher-margin API business.\r\nAnd in terms of its performance, API Manufacturing did well, sales 6% higher. Growth in the speciality opiates business, launch of a new generic for drug addiction, we benefited from; and continued growth in the ADHD methylphenidate API area, which has helped us. Research Chemicals had a reasonably tough year. They ran out of capacity, ran out of storage space in some of their markets, which we've now put right, particularly in China and the West Coast of the U.S.A. So that ought to return to some growth. And cat and chiral technologies grew its sales slightly but its profits pretty nicely.\r\nLooking ahead in fine chem. Steady progress in APIs, especially in the U.S. We are continuing to invest in adding more APIs to the portfolio. That will benefit our sales in future years. And that involved working with customers, of course, to develop new -- and all this is in the generic drugs space. So the new warehouses, they will help with Research Chemicals, and so that should recover.\r\nA couple of slides on New Businesses. Sales up a lot, but that's the full year effect of one of the acquisitions we made, battery systems business that we made through the year. Robust demand for e-bikes and power tools, which we supply. We've made an acquisition here. I don't know if it's referred to in the notes. I'll touch on that a little bit later.\r\nFuel Cells had a tough year in that its customers, which are all in the stationary power generation field, have not developed as we expected, but we are very pleased with the way that they have positioned themselves alongside car companies and are hopeful that we'll get a share of the cars that are made for the Californian market in the future.\r\nSo here's the acquisition of A123. We haven't bought the whole of A123, but we've bought -- or we're in the process of buying the materials factory, which is mainly in China. So that's very helpful to our ambition to be a key materials supplier. That's where we think we can add value in the battery space. And we ought to have now the capacity to supply the customers once we've developed the products. Pleased about that.\r\nJust a slide on non-financial performance because we're pretty proud of what we've done in JM in terms of sustainability and particularly in Manufacturing Excellence. So we set ourselves some targets in 2007 to get to a different place in 2017, when we're 200 years old, and here's a little bit of the data that I think you'll find interesting.\r\nSo we've more than doubled our earnings per share since 2007. Our target was to double by 2017. And we've also more than doubled our sales, but the rate of energy use per unit in sales is actually down 44%, global warming potential down 50%, water use down 40%, just an indicator that we're a much more efficient company now and much more sustainable as we enter our third century.\r\nSo the outlook. Further progress in ECT. European car market looking a little better. Tighter truck and car legislation in the mix going forward, and that's the medium-term prognosis that sales will be driven by tightening legislation and increased growth in vehicles going forward. We do expect progress in Process Technologies, too. Chemicals has got a really good long-term outlook, but I just put that warning out there that you shouldn't judge this business on 1 quarter. This business is a bit difficult to predict on the exact timing of some of the large contracts. Oil and Gas, we expect to be robust. And the 2 long-term drivers, the key ones being coal to products in China and gas in North America, remain very positive here.\r\nWe expect steady progress in Precious Metal Products, excluding the Anglo situation. And we think our pgm refining volumes will be stable and they ought to benefit from slightly higher precious metal prices going forward. And the outlook for the Manufacturing business remains, I'm afraid, a little mixed, some good in medical, some not so good in industrial.\r\nSteady growth in fine chem. CCT and Research Chemicals, we'll also expect some growth in the coming year. Pretty much similar in New Businesses. This is a long-term investment for us. One of the big long-term investments we made in the last 20 years has been in heavy duty diesel. That's now delivering us GBP 570 million worth of sales. We have aspirations for something else in this portfolio to do something similar in the future.\r\nSo for the group, underlying growth strong, offset by some headwinds; currently expects next year, this year, to be broadly in line with the year we just reported on. We are really well placed for long-term growth.\r\nSo here's the key messages again just to remind you. We had a very strong year, actually a record year: underlying EPS up 16%, growth in all of the divisions, plenty of investment going into this business to put it in a good place for the future. And we expect it to be broadly in-line but very strong double-digit growth in underlying profits.\r\nSo here's the team that are going to answer your questions. And I'll also take a moment to talk to you again about the management changes here. As you know, I'm going to sort of shuffled off to the left of this chart and be replaced by Robert. So this has been a brilliant 10 years for me. I've been a really lucky guy to be in charge of this company. I think we had a pretty good company 10 years ago. I think it's a much better company now. And I think it's really well placed for the future. And I've also enjoyed working with you guys and, through you, with a very supportive bunch of shareholders.\r\nSo if you'll just give us a minute to assemble at the front here, we will answer your questions. Thank you.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Neil Carson (Executives)】\nThank you, Sally [ph], and welcome to Johnson Matthey's presentation of the results for our year ended 31st of March 2014. And before I start, I've got an introduction to make. We've got a newcomer. It's Den Jones, our new FD, starts work today. So those of you who don't know him, there he is. I'm sure you'll make his acquaintance into the future.\r\nSo usual format from us: a quick introduction from me, one slide; then move into the financial review from Robert; and then we'll go through each of the divisions, I'll do that. And then we'll spare some time at the end to handle your questions.\r\nWe had a really good year in 2013, '14. Now sales were up strongly, and so was our underlying EPS. And growth came across all of our 5 divisions, but of particular note was a very strong performance from ECT. We've continued to invest in our business, particularly the R&D where we've increased spend again by another 12%, but also you'll have heard some extra manufacturing capacity in ECT and in PT, of large investments in more capacity. And so look forward into 2014, '15, we expect to be broadly in line with last year, but that's because we've got some really strong underlying growth in profits because we've got some headwinds. We've got -- the first thing is the lack of an Anglo contract, which you know about, which is a kind of GBP 30 million headwind. And then we've got some adverse effects from currency, which is another GBP 20 million headwind. So double-digit underlying growth in profits for this business going forward. And as we always say, we're particularly well positioned for long-term growth in this business.\r\nSo with that, let me hand over to Robert.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Robert MacLeod (Executives)】\nThank you, Neil. And good morning, everybody.\r\nAs normal, I will just go through some of the financial metrics. So looking first at the underlying results, Neil has already said sales up 11%, profits up 14% and earnings per share by 16%. These are all the underlying numbers. And within this, you can see operating profit grew 13%, slightly higher than the growth in sales. Obviously, that's an improvement in margins. That will probably drop a bit this year because of the loss of the Anglo contract, which was a high-margin business, as you know.\r\nForeign exchange didn't really make much of an impact on us this year, the year we just reported. So these numbers, in the difference between the actual numbers and constant currency numbers, aren't much different, but as Neil has already said, roughly, if the rates stay the same, there'll be a GBP 20 million adverse hit for this year that we're now in. The biggest impact on that is dollars, and then after that, it's euros and renminbi. Those are the 3 big ones, and together, they make up nearly GBP 18 million. Then in the other currencies, the tail is the extra GBP 2 million or GBP 3 million that gets us just around the GBP 20 million number.\r\nLooking at interest. Interest went up a lot this year, partly because of higher pension interest charges. As you know, that's the way we have to account for it nowadays, but also we had some prefunding of our debt. We borrowed some money earlier than we needed because we took advantage of low interest rates, and that cost us about GBP 1.5 million, and that obviously won't recur in the year we're in now.\r\nLooking at tax rate. Tax rate for this year was 19.4% on the group on underlying numbers. The U.K. tax rate for the year we just finished was 23%, so a little over 3% below the headline rate. As you know, the U.K. rate is going to drop from 23% in the year we just finished to 21% this year and we still will have at least 3% below that, and then it will drop to 20% next year. Those have all been enacted.\r\nAnd finally on this slide, looking at the dividend. We've grown the dividend 10% this year, slightly below the rate in underlying earnings per share. Dividend cover of 2.7x, so we've grown the cover a bit. We've done that. As you know, the board wants to have a progressive dividend policy. And we have taken into account the fact that, this year, we're going to lose the Anglo contract, but we want to have that progressive dividend going forward. Right about a cover around 2.5x on average is what we're looking to do.\r\nWithin the underlying profit numbers, you can see on this slide there's a couple of one-offs. Pension gains, I'll talk a little bit about in a few slides time. It's just over GBP 10 million, which is spread across the business, as you can see. And then the closure costs of one of our businesses in Precious Metal Products, one of our old ceramic color products businesses, and that cost us GBP 8 million within Precious Metal Products. Both of these items are one-off items, though.\r\nJust a small note on corporate costs, up a bit more than last year, right about 1.1% of sales, and that's -- it's been around 1.1% of sales for many, many years. As the business is growing, we need to increase the costs in the corporate center just delivering the growth that we've got across the group. And last year was a bit of an anomaly really because of -- sorry, I didn't mean the year we just finished, the year before that, where we didn't meet our end-year profit targets.\r\nTurning now to cash. Good cash flow performance in the year, particularly well driven by improvement in working capital. Working capital days, down from 53 to 45. Huge amount of efforts going on, particularly in ECT where they've done really, really well on managing working capital. No one particular silver bullet. This is a whole pile of initiatives across the division. I think 45 is probably a really good number, and I think right about 50 is probably where we should be targeting, but hopefully, we can keep that continued performance on keeping the working capital days down.\r\nNet debt, down GBP 100 million to GBP 729 million. And with the reduction in pension numbers that I talked about and I can talk about a bit more later, our net debt-to-EBITDA is currently at 1.3x, so slightly outside our range, which as you know is 1.5x to 2x, but not that far away really.\r\nTurning now to cash flow conversion. So this is how we turn our profit into cash, and you can see, down slightly, 82% compared to 85% last year. And the principal driver for this was the continued growth in CapEx. And we expect that to continue, and that will keep our cash flow conversion around about 75%, maybe 80%, in the next few years.\r\nReturn on capital, also good, nicely ahead of our target, which is 20%, which is we keep that target of 20%, we're not changing that despite the change in the Anglo arrangements, driven by particularly good performance in ECT. Why did they do so well? Partly because of the very good growth in profit but partly because of that working capital improvement I mentioned. Slightly lower in Precious Metal Products division, again partly because of the Anglo contract reduction in profit, but also because we had at the end of the year some higher metal inventories. And the reason for that, of course, is as you know, the supply disruptions in South Africa. From an insurance point of view, we wanted to increase our metal inventory levels to make sure we satisfy our customers' demands.\r\nCapital expenditure, nearly GBP 220 million last year. Big projects in ECT: We've told you about in U.K. and Macedonia ahead of the new legislation, which is now in place or coming in place in the U.K. too. Expansion of additives capacity in the U.S., which is now complete, which is we bought this business in INTERCAT a few years ago. We've now been expanding the capacity there in our additives business.\r\nSo CapEx depreciation just about 1.7x. I think that we'll stay around that sort of level for the next couple of years, with CapEx around about GBP 240 million this year. So slightly more CapEx, but of course, the depreciation has gone up a little bit too, which is why the CapEx depreciation number stays fairly similar. And most of the CapEx or a lot -- a larger portion of the CapEx going forward is going to be in Process Technologies, as I think Geoff explained to you at the Capital Markets Day a few months ago.\r\nNow finally for me, looking at the pension schemes, you can see that the deficits have gone down quite a long way, partly driven by lower discounts -- sorry, higher discount rates and some ongoing derisking. Particularly, derisking that we've done, I talked a little bit already about the curtailment gains. That's -- that GBP 10 million is spread across the various divisions. We closed the U.S. scheme to new entrants and did a few other things as well, which I can explain if you want more detail, and those gave us these one-off gains. But we're now getting to a stage where we're narrowing down the sort of range of potential outcomes of these pension schemes. The volatility is becoming much less. But we did put GBP 27 million in last year to fund the deficits in both of these schemes, and we'd expect to put a similar level of cash flow in this year as well.\r\nWith that, I'll -- it's finished for me. I'll hand it back to Neil.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Neil Carson (Executives)】\nThank you, Robert.\r\nSo the operating review. As always, we'll start with ECT, emissions control technologies. Good set of numbers, as you can see: sales up 13%, operating profit up 25%. And I'd point to you that return on invested capital, which is a very strong number, 21%, so good effort on lots of fronts by ECT.\r\nECT exceeded our expectations for the year. And some of it was an improved product mix that we got in Europe. I think diesel sale -- car sales held up better than we were kind of expecting, and our share of those was strong. Good growth in our Asian businesses. And the implementation, of course, a highlight, which is the Euro VI legislation that benefited our HDD business in Europe. So the pie chart shows you the split of the sales. And interesting to note, 35% of our sales now are in HDD, whereas in 2006, probably that was 0. So exciting area for us.\r\nWe're dependent on car sales. Here, our car sales globally in the 3 regions and globally divided and analyzed in our financial year. So you can see some growth in North America and Asia but flat in our year in Europe, and global sales up 3-ish percent. But there are some signs of progress in car sales after many years of depressed car sales in Europe. Particularly, you can see that, half 2 of last year compared to half 2 of the year before, there's some glimmers of some growth, which is very welcome.\r\nSo here are our sales broken down by region for light duty catalyst. And you can see we've hit GBP 1 billion of total sales, up 8%, so we exceeded the growth in the market, which was 3-ish percent. North America broadly grew in line with the market. And in Europe, we outperformed the market. I've talked about the product mix, which has been a benefit, and the fact that diesel cars have maintained a reasonable share of the market, so a 5% growth in our sales in Europe. And a good growth, good strong growth in Asia. We've done pretty well in China. We've probably picked up some new business. And -- but also, in the rest of Southeast Asia, we've been doing well.\r\nSo operating profit, well ahead, and some good results from our process efficiency, Manufacturing Excellence and sustainability efforts that have really started to impact the cost side in ECT.\r\nHere's the outlook, as published by LMC Automotive. And you can see that global car sales will hit 100 million in a couple of years’ time and steady growth in all the markets. So I would think that the 2014 number in Europe might look a bit better than that by the time we get to the end of 2014.\r\nSo moving on to trucks, HDD truck sales and production, healthy markets. North America has grown well, as has Europe, year-on-year. And then second half on second half, yes, a bit of an acceleration really in sales of trucks in Europe and North America, so a healthy picture. And here are our sales: GBP 573 million of total sales in this area, up 20%. In North America, a reasonably good market. We grew in line with it. We're particularly well represented on Class 8 trucks, and they've picked up recently. But Europe has done also very well and has had the impact of the tighter legislation. Of course, the next year will show a full year of impact from tighter legislation. And just to give you a guide: Euro VI sales now in Europe, about 60% of the total sales.\r\nIn Asia, a big increase from a small-ish number. And as we suspected, the new legislation that's impacted China is not being fully implemented, but it's being implemented in about 10% of the potential cases, mainly in buses and in cities. We've got a good share of that business, as you can see. So continuing tightening legislation in Europe and China will benefit this business going forward. And we've got non-road sales, which are going to start to make an impact on the sales going forward.\r\nSo looking ahead for ECT. Well, the situation in Europe looks a bit better on cars, some car sales -- positive car sales data, which we haven't seen for a number of years. And the legislation is going to get tighter, so Euro 6b and c will add value to each car that we supply in the next couple of years. There's lots of talk about CO2 legislation and limits both in Europe and in North America, and they're broadly positive for us in that smaller engines are more complex designs, and that gives us an opportunity.\r\nSo in heavy duty, in the developed markets, as I've mentioned before, we're going to have a full year effect of the Euro VI legislation in Europe and a continued rollout of the non-road business. In developing markets, China is a focus for us. And we predicted a while ago that, when the Euro IV legislation arrived, it would take 4 or 5 or 6 years to be fully implemented, and that looks to us like how it's going to be. It's a lower-technology solution because it's only Euro IV and it's a little bit more competitive, but we're pretty happy with the share of that business that we've secured.\r\nProcess technology. Here are the key numbers. So sales up 11% and profits up 10%. Return on sales, steady. This was -- this division benefited from the addition of Formox, which we're very pleased to have added to the group. And if you strip out the sales of Formox, there was some growth in the rest of the division, particularly good performance in our Oil and Gas business. And you can see the split of sales there between Chemicals and oil and gas. But as we anticipated, our licensing sales have come out -- come down from a higher point in the previous few years and were lower at GBP 82 million.\r\nSo let's talk about the Chemicals business first. Here's the makeup of the GBP 339 million of sales that we make. Sales up 13%. Of course, that was benefited by the addition of Formox and formaldehyde catalysts and technology we're very pleased with. It's gone very well. Methanol did pretty well. And we signed 3 new SNG licenses in China. The Oleo/biochemicals side is -- did well in a fairly flat market. And in the Petrochemicals side, we've increased our catalyst volumes, but the licensing revenue is down, and you can see from that bar chart the effect. But important also to note here that, in 2013, we sold 5 oxo licenses that are particularly high earners for us in the oxo license; and this year, in 2014, only 1. But some SNG licenses were sold, but to note there that the SNG license sale benefits quite a lot off the catalyst sales side rather than the licensing income side.\r\nWe are developing some new technologies. The requirements for more and more oxo into the long-term future will sometime come to a bit of an end, but we have got some good new technologies in the pipeline. MEG and VCM are 2 of them.\r\nOil and Gas business has done pretty well. Sales grew 9%. There's an action in the refineries in the U.S. for the first time in a number of years, so that's boosted some hydrogen catalyst sales. You can see the split of the sales there. Gas Processing did well. And our Diagnostic Services business is also doing well on unconventional oil and gas opportunities in the U.S. and is adding some new technology to its portfolio for the analysis of the wall thickness of pipelines.\r\nSo looking ahead in PT. We do expect progress in the Chemicals side in 2014, '15, but we would flag that the timing of these orders, particularly for licenses, are really difficult to project exactly when they're going to hit us. We haven't lost any business, but the timing of orders is slightly uncertain. So it's not really appropriate to judge this business on 1 quarter of its performance. We're still continuing to develop our new technologies and the expansion of the petrochemical industry. So coal getting turned into products in China, that's a big driver for this business and that will continue. In the Oil and Gas area, we expect quite a robust year ahead, stronger demand from North American refineries and some opportunities coming up in the increased use of shale gas in the U.S., good drivers. So coal to products in China and shale gas in North America are key upsides to this business in the future.\r\nPrecious Metal Products. So a year of transition really for Precious Metal Products. Sales flat and profits up a little bit. So sales, in line with last year. You can see the split on that pie chart between the Services business and the Manufacturing businesses.\r\nSo you know the change in the Anglo Platinum arrangements will be an impact of about GBP 30 million in the coming year. And in the year past, there were some lower prices for precious metals, which had a bit of an impact; and some continued weaknesses, I have to say, in the industrial area in the Manufacturing businesses. Not all of them, but some of them are finding life a little tougher. And you've heard about the closure costs of part of our Color Technologies business, which really means our color technologies products now are all in the functional area rather than the decorative, which is where they came from many years ago.\r\nHere's the Services business data. Precious metal management sales, down 12%. Actually, Anglo American had a good first 9 months in the year and did better than we expected them to do, but that didn't offset the GBP 10 million hit, which was the 1 quarter's worth of the loss of the contract. There you can see the average prices, not a lot of movement there. And on the Refining business, sales were down a little bit. And in pgm refining and recycling, we had a slightly lower average basket price for pgms. Intake is pretty stable but the mix slightly less favorable. We're investing money in this area. It's a very strategically important area for us. We're the biggest pgm refiners of secondary material, and that's a very nice place to be when there's uncertainty in supply from the primary producers. There's the split of sales through the recycling side.\r\nIf we look now at the Manufacturing businesses. Sales up 11%, but actually, we've transferred in a little business out of ECT that was much better fit with PMD. So that boosted the sales by about GBP 24 million. Lower demand for nitric acid catalysts and N2O abatement technology on the industrial side but much better demand for the medical device components, where sales were up. Color tech did well. It's had a tough few years with lower car sales, particularly in Europe, but that's starting to do a lot better. And we've closed the decorative side. Chemical Products also did well on the back of ECT. They supply ECT with some raw materials in the precious metals side to make catalysts.\r\nLooking ahead. The impact from Anglo. Pgm Refining and Recycling currently looking a little bit better with slightly higher metal prices, volumes fairly stable. There is some increased competition here. The primary producers have got refineries which isn't having primary material go through them at the moment, so there are a little bit of increased competition here. And the surprise to us, I guess, is that the strikes in South Africa have -- so far have limited effect on the price. Mixed outlook for the Manufacturing businesses on the industrial side but growth in the medical business.\r\nFine Chemicals. Good year for fine chems, sales up, profits up 10%, pretty steady performance. There's the split of the sales between the API Manufacturing business, the catalyst and chiral tech and the Research Chemicals. And return on sales has benefited here from the higher-margin API business.\r\nAnd in terms of its performance, API Manufacturing did well, sales 6% higher. Growth in the speciality opiates business, launch of a new generic for drug addiction, we benefited from; and continued growth in the ADHD methylphenidate API area, which has helped us. Research Chemicals had a reasonably tough year. They ran out of capacity, ran out of storage space in some of their markets, which we've now put right, particularly in China and the West Coast of the U.S.A. So that ought to return to some growth. And cat and chiral technologies grew its sales slightly but its profits pretty nicely.\r\nLooking ahead in fine chem. Steady progress in APIs, especially in the U.S. We are continuing to invest in adding more APIs to the portfolio. That will benefit our sales in future years. And that involved working with customers, of course, to develop new -- and all this is in the generic drugs space. So the new warehouses, they will help with Research Chemicals, and so that should recover.\r\nA couple of slides on New Businesses. Sales up a lot, but that's the full year effect of one of the acquisitions we made, battery systems business that we made through the year. Robust demand for e-bikes and power tools, which we supply. We've made an acquisition here. I don't know if it's referred to in the notes. I'll touch on that a little bit later.\r\nFuel Cells had a tough year in that its customers, which are all in the stationary power generation field, have not developed as we expected, but we are very pleased with the way that they have positioned themselves alongside car companies and are hopeful that we'll get a share of the cars that are made for the Californian market in the future.\r\nSo here's the acquisition of A123. We haven't bought the whole of A123, but we've bought -- or we're in the process of buying the materials factory, which is mainly in China. So that's very helpful to our ambition to be a key materials supplier. That's where we think we can add value in the battery space. And we ought to have now the capacity to supply the customers once we've developed the products. Pleased about that.\r\nJust a slide on non-financial performance because we're pretty proud of what we've done in JM in terms of sustainability and particularly in Manufacturing Excellence. So we set ourselves some targets in 2007 to get to a different place in 2017, when we're 200 years old, and here's a little bit of the data that I think you'll find interesting.\r\nSo we've more than doubled our earnings per share since 2007. Our target was to double by 2017. And we've also more than doubled our sales, but the rate of energy use per unit in sales is actually down 44%, global warming potential down 50%, water use down 40%, just an indicator that we're a much more efficient company now and much more sustainable as we enter our third century.\r\nSo the outlook. Further progress in ECT. European car market looking a little better. Tighter truck and car legislation in the mix going forward, and that's the medium-term prognosis that sales will be driven by tightening legislation and increased growth in vehicles going forward. We do expect progress in Process Technologies, too. Chemicals has got a really good long-term outlook, but I just put that warning out there that you shouldn't judge this business on 1 quarter. This business is a bit difficult to predict on the exact timing of some of the large contracts. Oil and Gas, we expect to be robust. And the 2 long-term drivers, the key ones being coal to products in China and gas in North America, remain very positive here.\r\nWe expect steady progress in Precious Metal Products, excluding the Anglo situation. And we think our pgm refining volumes will be stable and they ought to benefit from slightly higher precious metal prices going forward. And the outlook for the Manufacturing business remains, I'm afraid, a little mixed, some good in medical, some not so good in industrial.\r\nSteady growth in fine chem. CCT and Research Chemicals, we'll also expect some growth in the coming year. Pretty much similar in New Businesses. This is a long-term investment for us. One of the big long-term investments we made in the last 20 years has been in heavy duty diesel. That's now delivering us GBP 570 million worth of sales. We have aspirations for something else in this portfolio to do something similar in the future.\r\nSo for the group, underlying growth strong, offset by some headwinds; currently expects next year, this year, to be broadly in line with the year we just reported on. We are really well placed for long-term growth.\r\nSo here's the key messages again just to remind you. We had a very strong year, actually a record year: underlying EPS up 16%, growth in all of the divisions, plenty of investment going into this business to put it in a good place for the future. And we expect it to be broadly in-line but very strong double-digit growth in underlying profits.\r\nSo here's the team that are going to answer your questions. And I'll also take a moment to talk to you again about the management changes here. As you know, I'm going to sort of shuffled off to the left of this chart and be replaced by Robert. So this has been a brilliant 10 years for me. I've been a really lucky guy to be in charge of this company. I think we had a pretty good company 10 years ago. I think it's a much better company now. And I think it's really well placed for the future. And I've also enjoyed working with you guys and, through you, with a very supportive bunch of shareholders.\r\nSo if you'll just give us a minute to assemble at the front here, we will answer your questions. Thank you.",
      "transcript_text3": "So there are some roving mics, as usual. And if you could please tell us who you are and who you represent before you ask your question. We'll do our best to answer it, the division directors and other senior management here in the front row. And Andrew had his hand up first there in the middle. Someone get to Andrew there, Noel? Thanks.\n\n---\n\nIt's Paul Walsh, Morgan Stanley. I have 2 questions -- don't worry. I think my grandmother wanted to call me Andrew when I was born, actually, so you've got insights there. As far as the questions I had, on the Euro 6b regulations, 2 questions, I guess. Within your Euro LDV business, how much is diesel, and how much is petrol? And over what period of time would you expect that 20% increase in value to crystallize? And then my second question, on Euro 6c, what's the value proposition there in terms of potential uplift? I think you've given it before, but it slipped my mind.\n\n---\n\nJohn, could you have a go at those?\n\n---\n\nYes. I think diesel-to-gasoline in Europe, in the numbers that we have in the book, are 51-49, diesel 51, gasoline 49 for Western Europe. And...\n\n---\n\nThat's the market sales. And we don't really talk about our sales. And you probably don't have that data, I'm imagining.\n\n---\n\nWe're probably a little bit heavier in diesel and in gasoline than the market. And typically, it takes about 3 years to roll out the new legislation.\n\n---\n\nBut the impact per vehicle on Euro 6b and c, we have talked about that before, I think.\n\n---\n\nYes. Euro 6b, we're saying sales will be up 20%. And Euro 6c, we're saying it's going be double the value of the gasoline catalyst sale.\n\n---\n\nCan I just be clear on the Euro 6c? It's not for all gasoline cars. It's only the direct injection gasoline cars, which are around about half of them. So it's not the entire -- you kind of take -- it's half of will be roughly double of the other half.\n\n---\n\nUp to 40% rather than...\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nThank you. Rakesh? You haven't changed your name, Rakesh?\n\n---\n\nNo, I haven't changed my name. I have 2 questions, I guess. 1 just on PT. And I know you've kind of said not to judge it on each quarter, but just looking at some of the comments from, I think, your customers saying that, especially in the U.S., there kind of -- there might be some delays or actually delayed installation of new petrochemical plants not by sort of a quarter but sort of 1 to 2 years, if not more, so I'm kind of wondering to what extent we should still continue to expect double-digit growth out of PT day in, day out. And this year was kind of impacted by the acquisition of Formox. And then secondly, just on pgm refining, you've talked a little bit about increased competition, and I wanted to know, to what extent is Johnson Matthey wedded to pgm refining? I mean do you -- would you ever look to exit this business? And then finally, just on heavy duty diesel in China, the usual question which comes up every quarter in terms of where we are in market share, if you're still thinking 1/3, 1/3, 1/3; as we go out, how the mechanical shift of your share in HDD should evolve over time.\n\n---\n\nOkay, quite a list there. Could you want to start with the PT ones, Larry? I shall worry [ph] about the future and the timing, et cetera.\n\n---\n\nSure. We're confident in the future. We've always said the PT business is a lumpy business, and I -- that hasn't changed. The timing of licensing orders, the timing of rather large catalyst sales, difficult to predict, but our guidance hasn't changed. We still see on average double-digit growth in PT.\n\n---\n\nAnd yes, the projects never come in earlier than they say. There's always some slippage, and that's a kind of fact of life, really.\n\n---\n\nEngineers are optimists, yes. That's a general rule, yes.\n\n---\n\nThat's right, yes. In the Refining -- pgm refining side, we are absolutely wedded to this business, but the first question was about the competitive nature of the business. We haven't lost any volume, but there are people out there competing for business, which has had a small effect on the margins, but that, to us, is a kind of second-order issue because we are the biggest pgm refiners of secondary material. That's a really handy thing to be when your main source of primary supply is on strike for 3, 4 months. And it's difficult to predict what the future will be in terms of reliability of supply from South Africa, and the other big supplier is Russia. So this is very strategic for us and for that reason. For a number of years, we've been investing in a new flowsheet for that business, which will make it better and more efficient. And there's no prospect of us exiting that business anytime soon because there's no way we can with being in this precious metal business. And HDD in China, about 1/3 of that, John, is that how you see it going forward?\n\n---\n\nYes. I think China HDD, we would say, going forward, 1/3, 1/3, 1/3, and the other 10% being local Chinese companies. So I don't think we're changing our guidance there. We probably did a little bit better than that on the first 10%, on the bus fitment, but that's probably a one-off thing. And there's a couple of interesting things that are happening that should help heavy duty in China. The one thing is they finally sorted out the fuel so that, from the 1st of January 2015, the Euro fuel -- Euro IV fuel should be available nationwide. So that should eliminate any of these people who were saying that they cannot fit emission control equipment to heavy duty vehicles there. And it looks like they're coming close to a particle number requirement for Beijing. So there's the possibility that, that should add some -- don't get too carried away here, but should add some filters to city vehicles.\n\n---\n\nRather than partial filters.\n\n---\n\nRather than partial filters.\n\n---\n\nYes. So positive. And another question down here, please. Thank you.\n\n---\n\nSimon Fickling from Exane, please. A first question on HDD and the Euro VI legislation there. The -- you flagged in this release and, I think, at Q3 that sort of early orders are filling the pipeline. An assessment, please, of where you think inventories are and the risk maybe for the next couple of quarters that orders are slightly softer and the momentum is slightly weaker given the level of inventories in the system. ECT, more broadly, process efficiency, is there much more to come in terms of that? And finally, on the M&A side, there's been a bit less in the year just ended. There's the A123 deal, but wondering sort of where that may focus, and perhaps an indication as well on appetite for bigger deals that could perhaps involve a rights issue or sort of more transformation on the portfolio.\n\n---\n\nOkay, Simon, thank you. HDD, John, Euro VI inventories, and is it all going to fall off a cliff?\n\n---\n\nVisibility of inventory in Europe is less than in North America, for example, but the dreaded dip of the post prebuy, I think I can confidently say that, that's not happening in the first quarter. And I feel a little bit better that it's going to be less of an impact on the second quarter as well, but I still point out that we don't really know what the inventory situation is. So there could be a slight softening, but I would say that's probably less than we thought before. On process efficiencies, as you know, we just are finishing up our second phase of Macedonia and also finishing up the filter investment in Royston. And in particular, Macedonia, we're 3/4 of the way through to filling up, or we're 100% in filling up the first build and we're starting to increase the utilization of the second build. Line three has been up and running now for several months, and process efficiencies from that plant are very good and improving. So yes, I'd say there will still be more to come in terms of leveraging that investment.\n\n---\n\nAnd globally, the Manufacturing Excellence effort is having an effect everywhere in all 15 plants, so...\n\n---\n\nWe have a very embedded Manufacturing Excellence program right now, and that's going very well. So yes, I support Neil's comments there.\n\n---\n\nOn M&A, well, we don't make that much M&A, and it's because now in our -- most of our businesses, we've got higher market shares in small-ish markets, and the things we want to buy, we're not able to do. We have aspirations to make large M&A, but there's nothing particularly on the horizon, I have to say. But more of the M&A will be of the kind that we've seen with A123, so buying some specific assets that we need to give us a route to market for some of our new technologies in New Businesses. I think that will kind of sum it up. Is that okay? Lady in the middle of the back. And then you're Andrew [ph], aren't you? Yes, you are. Middle at the back?\n\n---\n\nIt's Evgenia Molotova from Berenberg. I have 3 questions. On ECT, on your improved product mix in diesel, how sustainable is -- I think it stopped working somehow -- how sustainable is the product mix improvement? And how long will this contract last? And also, just one question on the comparables. Will you still experience stronger growth because of this gain of this contract in the first half of the year? Just when did it start the product mix change? And the second question -- the third question is on pgm refining. So when primary miners are on strike, does it mean that you have higher competition because they can actually refine more of the secondary products because they don't get resource from the mining, or not?\n\n---\n\nYes, I don't think we were talking about one contract in the...\n\n---\n\nI didn't -- I meant as a whole.\n\n---\n\nYes. John, pretty sustainable product mix of the book [ph]?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think the -- for at least the next several years, the trends that we're seeing are going to continue. So what we saw for the year ended, '13, '14, over the next 2 to 3 years, we should see something similar. Those extra filters that we have will remain. And again, it's not any one contract. It's a variety of things.\n\n---\n\nAnd then the new legislations coming along, which will add value again per vehicle. So we don't see this going backwards.\n\n---\n\nLet's just be clear on that. So just to be clear, that boosted the year we're in because, comparative to the year before, we didn't have that product mix benefit. So now it's in the comparatives. So now going forward, you're not going to have another boost. That contract is still there, so it's that we'll maintain that rather than drop like that.\n\n---\n\nWhat I wanted to know is if contracts will still be the same.\n\n---\n\nI think our overall guidance remains the same, which is we -- in cars, we ought to outperform the market by a couple of percent in terms of our sales. We've done a little bit better than that in the last couple of years, but that will be the guidance that we'll have you take on. And yes, exactly the point that you made, the primary producers have got refineries not doing so much and so have the availability of capacity to compete in the secondary market, and that's something they'd really like to do. But as I also said, when mining comes back, maybe that will go away. I don't know. So it's not something that has shifted much, but it's been a depressor of the margins a little bit. Is that enough? Okay. Adam there, just in front.\n\n---\n\nIt's Adam Collins, Liberum. A couple of questions, please, on the catalysts side. So firstly, on the platinum procurement risks associated with the strikes in South Africa, we've had roughly 20% of world supply offline for 4 months now, and even if they restarted today, it would be roughly 3 months before they could supply the market again. Clearly, you haven't had a problem so far. And there would appear to be quite a lot of plate supply out there but maybe some shortages around sponge. I wonder if you could just talk more broadly about your experience so far in getting the metal you need; and whether we need to worry, if strikes continue for the rest of the year, about this becoming a supply problem for you; and how, if that was the case, that mining powder business, whether a force majeure like that and supply problems that you're in would impact your business or whether there are some contractual arrangements for you to recover there. That's the first question.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Adam. So we're going to pause for breath, and I'll have Andrew -- or Alan answer that one for you, Alan Myers, who runs that business.\n\n---\n\nYes. Thank you. So far, we've met all of our obligations to customers. As Neil talked -- pointed out, we built substantial stocks prior to knowing that the strike was coming. We've had a very strong conversion program of converting ingot to sponge in place for several months to meet our customer commitments. And really, we're in excellent position. We're the largest secondary refiner in the world. That gives us momentum that our competition doesn't have. And therefore, we really see no issue in the medium term. Obviously, if the strike went on for a long time, that would change the fundamentals of the whole marketplace, but today and for the medium term, we expect really no issue with supplying to our customers.\n\n---\n\nAnd with that changing the market fundamentals means much higher prices, which means potentially metal coming out of jewelry, metal coming out of lots of other applications through our refinery. We signed up agreements with other mines for more processing of primary supply too. So we're in about as best shape as anyone could be, although you're right to flag it as a long-term concern. [indiscernible]? Next question, yes.\n\n---\n\nYes, okay. The second question is on margin expansion in ECT, quite a noticeable uplift in the second half of last year. And I just wondered if you could sort of talk about what drove that. To what extent was that down to the diesel value add issues in light duty? Would it have quite a lot to do with the Euro VI ramp in HDD? I think, in the past, you've talked about the fact that the expansion of Euro VI HDD would be margin dilutive because of the high-value substrates in filters. You then adjust that to saying it would be broadly neutral for divisional margin. I suspect it may be actually accretive, from the look of the second half results. Is that the case? Would you expect margin to increase further in the coming year as HDD becomes a larger part of the sales basket?\n\n---\n\nJohn?\n\n---\n\nThere's several reasons for margin improvement, but specifically on the heavy duty side, I guess one of the things that happened is that a large proportion of our European heavy duty sales were manufactured in Germany in the past. And as we especially entered the fourth quarter and now going forward, more of our heavy duty sales on the flow-through side are being made in Macedonia. So again, it's another efficiency benefit that is having a knock-on effect on margins. So yes, I...\n\n---\n\nSo it's alive, isn't it?\n\n---\n\nYes, yes, and that's going to continue.\n\n---\n\nYes, so that's the major effect, I think.\n\n---\n\nIn HDD?\n\n---\n\nNo, but the efficiency. I mean HDD has an -- is an element of it, but it's the efficiency of the newer plants and the benefits of the Manufacturing Excellence programs. You're looking skeptical, so have a word with John afterwards.\n\n---\n\nI'm sure he will.\n\n---\n\nYes. Thomas? Sorry, Andrew [ph], we'll get to you, but after that -- afterwards.\n\n---\n\nTwo questions. Unless I fell asleep in the -- during the Capital Markets Day, you didn't talk a lot about the chloralkali catalysis. So is the reason you're flagging this now as a new opportunity in PT is that because the coal price has fallen, customers are starting to embrace the technology? Or do you -- did you have a breakthrough on the R&D side there? And can you sort of dimensionize your position in that chloralkali business relative to competition? And then the second one is more short term. Just clarifying, I mean some of the suppliers to the U.S. refinery industry, we're talking about revenues down 10% because of weather and outages. And you are saying U.S. Refining has been strong, will be strong. And so you're saying there was no impact of the weather on inventories in your business and just you're sailing through the U.S. Refining market like a knife through butter. Is that what you're saying?\n\n---\n\nLet's have Geoff handle that one. He's never used the weather as an excuse so far, so...\n\n---\n\nWell, we can now. Just on the first one, the chloralkali comment, well, I need to talk to Nick here because that's not a business that we do anything in.\n\n---\n\nHe's talking about VCM.\n\n---\n\nYes, on VCM...\n\n---\n\nOh, VCM. Okay, on VCM side, yes. It's something we just bought technology from Jacobs. And we're also building a catalyst plant now in Shanghai to supply that market with a different technology.\n\n---\n\nDifferent technology. We invented some technology. We were sharing the technology with Jacobs half and half. We bought their half, so that's now a viable opportunity for the future.\n\n---\n\nAnd what -- we really like it. It's a mercury-free replacement catalyst for China, which we think will have good uptake over the next several years.\n\n---\n\nWhich is actually legislated for.\n\n---\n\nThe -- so that's the legislation. Because the reason I'm asking is, when coal prices were high, the Chinese PVC or VCM, they were running 60% utilization. And now that the coal price is low, now they're running 85%, 90% [indiscernible]. But you're saying this legislation will be a...\n\n---\n\nWell, there's legislation to get rid of the mercury catalyst that's used presently. And the product we have should be a reasonable -- I wouldn't say quite drop-in on the old process, but we can retrofit the existing processes, and then going forward, we have the technology to go forward.\n\n---\n\nAnd how much advantage do you have to competition on that mercury-free side?\n\n---\n\nWell, we're the only one that, I mean, we have patent position on it, we're the only ones right now. So on the weather question, I don't think we really saw any effect. And I'm not sure that we see it -- we're quite as sophisticated to tell what's -- what the effect is on -- from weather on some of our demand, yes.\n\n---\n\nSo we're still selling out some additives and hydrogen gas.\n\n---\n\nSold, yes. We had a good year in the U.S. on both the hydrogen side and on additives, so we really didn't see any effect.\n\n---\n\nRemember, the additives bit of our business has 2 roles to play. There's an environmental role, okay, in which case there's still tightening of environmental requirements on petroleum refineries. So that's -- in the U.S., that's allowing us to add capacity, add sales.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Thomas. Andrew [ph]? Do you still have that question, Andrew [ph]? Yes.\n\n---\n\nSo it's really around New Businesses and particularly the A123 deal. You said you've bought some of it, not all of it. I just wonder if you could be a bit more detailed on that. So what have you left behind, and why? How does it link into Axeon, if at all? Why did you -- what was the specific attraction of this asset? And then staying with that whole new business enterprise, I just wondered what the definition of -- or some better definition of \"some time\" is, so sometime before the division moves into profit. I mean just a sense of the key drivers and a sense of the timetable. And then the second question is completely different, on -- back to HDD. We don't talk a lot -- or haven't talked a lot about the non-road business. And I see from your presentation, non-road is now 10% of HDD. I could be wrong. It feels a bit behind plan, but maybe I'm wrong. And I just wondered if you could just update us on what you're seeing in non-road.\n\n---\n\nNick, do you want to handle what we've actually bought from A123, and how it fits?\n\n---\n\nI shall try. Andrew, your name right, the ambition in the batteries area for us has always been about the attachment in the materials side. That's the fit to us. It's tackling this challenge of the energy density, which is sort of the electrochemical barrier created by materials deficiencies in the current technologies. And so it's always been about materials production, and that's the assets we're buying out of A123. We've never been keen on the cell manufacturing space. It's not what we do. It's not what we want to do. It's about materials development. So we've got battery development capabilities which we're building, but we didn't have those manufacturing assets, which have current access and route into market, and that's what we're delivering. So to be quite specific, it's a manufacturing plant based in China and some of the technologies around that. That's what we're getting from A123. So relatively limited but allowing us a route to market. Is that satisfying?\n\n---\n\nAnd we get some business with it, too.\n\n---\n\nI mean we get the ongoing business into A123, which is as a successful cell manufacturers. So that's what we signed up onto. And we have a long-term arrangement we are establishing with them.\n\n---\n\nThe second part of that question is a tougher one, in terms of predicting profits. I mean this is, by its very nature, difficult to predict. What we can tell you for sure is we've got some really strong technologies, but that's not all you need. You need to have a route to market. That's what Nick is putting in place in batteries. And you need some compliant customers who really like what you've got to offer, and that takes a number of years. So I don't think we can be all that more specific. We can be -- we can give you a -- you know what our target is for the long term, so from when we started a few years ago. It was to have a significant business out of one of these things, i.e. 200 million-ish of sales 10 years from when we started, and we're a good 3 or 4 years in.\n\n---\n\nThat's right. And I think we just got to be patient with this a bit. I mean, as Neil said in his earlier comment, I mean we've now got nearly GBP 600 million of sales in HDD, and the R&D of that started nearly 20 years ago. What we've got here is, if you take the loss that we've got, GBP 18 million, more than 1/2 of it's in the fuel cell business, which we've had for some time. So the rest of the investment is a relatively small component of the overall investment we're making as a business. And I think sort of GBP 8 million, GBP 9 million a year, x the fuel cell business, is probably not a bad place to -- yes, a reasonable amount of money, I think, to invest.\n\n---\n\nAnd the final part was non-road. I guess that we could refer you back to the wave chart that we've printed a while ago. And I don't know exactly what non-road ought to be, but by the end of 2015, it was -- I can't remember. Was it GBP 0.5 billion or something?\n\n---\n\n[indiscernible]\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nWell, how are we doing, John, there?\n\n---\n\nYes?\n\n---\n\nWell, in the year just ended, we grew our non-road sales by 21%, so in line with the growth in heavy duty. And I think the thing that's changed a little bit since we talked about this 1.5 years ago or 2 years ago is that there's probably less filters on some of the non-road applications than we had originally thought. So some engine manufacturers have found ways to buy tuning and other adjustments to be able to avoid putting filters onto as many engines as we thought when we first talked about this. So I guess, directionally, yes, you're right, the -- compared to what we first said, the non-road numbers will be down a little bit, not dramatically.\n\n---\n\nThank you. One in the front here.\n\n---\n\nCharles Pick of Numis. Three questions, please. You mentioned a slight market share loss in respect of Europe on the HDD side after the Euro VI came in. I just wonder, when did -- why that arose, please? In Asia, the LDV catalyst sales were up about 12% in the first half. It's about 19% for the full year. And there's mention of some extra business being secured in China. I wondered if you could sort of elaborate on that, please. And was it just in China you're gaining the extra business? And finally, on the Process Technologies side, there's mention of how some extra CapEx may be sanctioned. I wondered if you could give an indication of the scale of that, please.\n\n---\n\nMarket share loss, John, in HDD? We started, obviously, with a very high market share, which we never really expected to maintain, but -- and when the technology changes, there's an opportunity for our -- I think we've done pretty well, haven't we?\n\n---\n\nYes. I think that it's kind of a mixing configuration thing. When some manufacturers made the change from Euro V to Euro VI, it changed the number of catalysts that were on some of the vehicles. So there was a -- it wasn't like we lost any business, but it effectively is a market share loss because the number of catalysts, in some cases, was lower on some of the European vehicles. But yes, we would say that, our heavy duty market share globally, we probably lost 5%. The other part of that has nothing to do with Europe, and that's just the natural dilution effect of the, as we talked earlier, 30%, 30%, 30% in China first getting [ph] because of the volumes as China comes on. It's just mathematics. So our market share number will be reducing globally because of that.\n\n---\n\nAnd the Asian business, light duty, picked up a bit?\n\n---\n\nAsian business. The big boom in Asia, I guess, was a combination of China, where we had some market share gains at -- in particular 2 customers, who will remain unnamed. And Southeast Asia, I think we've done very well. I think the scary thing is that if Thailand wasn't under martial law, we might have even done better, so...\n\n---\n\nAnd extra CapEx in PT?\n\n---\n\nYou asked -- the question was about our CapEx, or the customer's CapEx?\n\n---\n\n[indiscernible] in the statement as to how you're considering other opportunities that may increase the CapEx going forward.\n\n---\n\nAll right.\n\n---\n\nAll right. Yes, I mean this is, for us, it's -- I mean we're looking at investing in China to give us the facilities. And Geoff talked a little bit about VCM already and then also SNG assets maybe we need to put on the ground. And we're also investing in Germany to add capacity for our chemical catalysts too. So it's a range of things. And then there's always long-term opportunities as well with GTL, whether that -- if those come through in the U.S., then maybe we'll need some more capacity for those too, but that's a longer-term play.\n\n---\n\nThanks. John...\n\n---\n\n[indiscernible] order of magnitude then.\n\n---\n\nNo order of magnitude today.\n\n---\n\nWe're going to stay within our guidance that you've got on Robert's bit in terms of the company. Thank you, Charles. One at the back there.\n\n---\n\nPeter Michaelis from Alliance Trust Investments. Just on the sustainability side. I mean it's very impressive, what you've achieved over the last sort of 7 years. What's the ambition for the rest of the sustainability program? And where should we see it coming through? Is it a margin question, or is it actually improve your relationships with customers? Or where does it actually hit the profitability line?\n\n---\n\nIt's a journey that isn't complete, obviously. We're not at 2017 yet. We've hit one of our targets already, and we're pretty close to some of the others. So the job in the near term will be to set some more targets for the future and to go well past our 200th birthday. And where does it appear when it appears? All over the place in the numbers really but broadly on the cost side. So had we not reduced our electricity consumption per unit of sales by 44%, we'd be spending a lot more money on electricity. But this is not why the guys on the shop floor do this. They do this because they like the sustainability idea rather than the saving money idea. So that's what's gained a head of steam in Johnson Matthey, the fact that people think this is a thing they ought to be doing for when they're working for a company like JM. So it's a pretty powerful thing. And it fits now across -- it meshes very nicely now with Manufacturing Excellence, which if you would look at it from a different perspective is almost exactly the same kind of thing, so...\n\n---\n\nAnd it's also a very good motivator for our staff. I mean the graduates and the new employees, one of the things they like about coming to a company like Johnson Matthey is we do talk about sustainability and how it really matters. And so it's good for the bottom line, but it's also good for our employees and, hopefully, for all our stakeholders.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Peter. Any final questions before we draw a close?\r\nThen thank you very much, guys. It's been a pleasure working with you. Good luck for the future. Thank you.",

Thanks.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Walsh (Analysts)】\nIt's Paul Walsh, Morgan Stanley. I have 2 questions -- don't worry. I think my grandmother wanted to call me Andrew when I was born, actually, so you've got insights there. As far as the questions I had, on the Euro 6b regulations, 2 questions, I guess. Within your Euro LDV business, how much is diesel, and how much is petrol? And over what period of time would you expect that 20% increase in value to crystallize? And then my second question, on Euro 6c, what's the value proposition there in terms of potential uplift? I think you've given it before, but it slipped my mind.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Neil Carson (Executives)】\nJohn, could you have a go at those?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Walker (Executives)】\nYes. I think diesel-to-gasoline in Europe, in the numbers that we have in the book, are 51-49, diesel 51, gasoline 49 for Western Europe. And...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Neil Carson (Executives)】\nThat's the market sales. And we don't really talk about our sales. And you probably don't have that data, I'm imagining.\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Walker (Executives)】\nWe're probably a little bit heavier in diesel and in gasoline than the market. And typically, it takes about 3 years to roll out the new legislation.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Neil Carson (Executives)】\nBut the impact per vehicle on Euro 6b and c, we have talked about that before, I think.\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Walker (Executives)】\nYes. Euro 6b, we're saying sales will be up 20%. And Euro 6c, we're saying it's going be double the value of the gasoline catalyst sale.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert MacLeod (Executives)】\nCan I just be clear on the Euro 6c? It's not for all gasoline cars. It's only the direct injection gasoline cars, which are around about half of them. So it's not the entire -- you kind of take -- it's half of will be roughly double of the other half.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Walsh (Analysts)】\nUp to 40% rather than...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert MacLeod (Executives)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Neil Carson (Executives)】\nThank you. Rakesh? You haven't changed your name, Rakesh?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rakesh Patel (Analysts)】\nNo, I haven't changed my name. I have 2 questions, I guess. 1 just on PT. And I know you've kind of said not to judge it on each quarter, but just looking at some of the comments from, I think, your customers saying that, especially in the U.S., there kind of -- there might be some delays or actually delayed installation of new petrochemical plants not by sort of a quarter but sort of 1 to 2 years, if not more, so I'm kind of wondering to what extent we should still continue to expect double-digit growth out of PT day in, day out. And this year was kind of impacted by the acquisition of Formox. And then secondly, just on pgm refining, you've talked a little bit about increased competition, and I wanted to know, to what extent is Johnson Matthey wedded to pgm refining? I mean do you -- would you ever look to exit this business? And then finally, just on heavy duty diesel in China, the usual question which comes up every quarter in terms of where we are in market share, if you're still thinking 1/3, 1/3, 1/3; as we go out, how the mechanical shift of your share in HDD should evolve over time.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Neil Carson (Executives)】\nOkay, quite a list there. Could you want to start with the PT ones, Larry? I shall worry [ph] about the future and the timing, et cetera.\n\n---\n\n【回答: L. Pentz (Executives)】\nSure. We're confident in the future. We've always said the PT business is a lumpy business, and I -- that hasn't changed. The timing of licensing orders, the timing of rather large catalyst sales, difficult to predict, but our guidance hasn't changed. We still see on average double-digit growth in PT.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Neil Carson (Executives)】\nAnd yes, the projects never come in earlier than they say. There's always some slippage, and that's a kind of fact of life, really.\n\n---\n\n【回答: L. Pentz (Executives)】\nEngineers are optimists, yes. That's a general rule, yes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Neil Carson (Executives)】\nThat's right, yes. In the Refining -- pgm refining side, we are absolutely wedded to this business, but the first question was about the competitive nature of the business. We haven't lost any volume, but there are people out there competing for business, which has had a small effect on the margins, but that, to us, is a kind of second-order issue because we are the biggest pgm refiners of secondary material. That's a really handy thing to be when your main source of primary supply is on strike for 3, 4 months. And it's difficult to predict what the future will be in terms of reliability of supply from South Africa, and the other big supplier is Russia. So this is very strategic for us and for that reason. For a number of years, we've been investing in a new flowsheet for that business, which will make it better and more efficient. And there's no prospect of us exiting that business anytime soon because there's no way we can with being in this precious metal business. And HDD in China, about 1/3 of that, John, is that how you see it going forward?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Walker (Executives)】\nYes. I think China HDD, we would say, going forward, 1/3, 1/3, 1/3, and the other 10% being local Chinese companies. So I don't think we're changing our guidance there. We probably did a little bit better than that on the first 10%, on the bus fitment, but that's probably a one-off thing. And there's a couple of interesting things that are happening that should help heavy duty in China. The one thing is they finally sorted out the fuel so that, from the 1st of January 2015, the Euro fuel -- Euro IV fuel should be available nationwide. So that should eliminate any of these people who were saying that they cannot fit emission control equipment to heavy duty vehicles there. And it looks like they're coming close to a particle number requirement for Beijing. So there's the possibility that, that should add some -- don't get too carried away here, but should add some filters to city vehicles.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Neil Carson (Executives)】\nRather than partial filters.\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Walker (Executives)】\nRather than partial filters.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Neil Carson (Executives)】\nYes. So positive. And another question down here, please. Thank you.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Simon Fickling (Analysts)】\nSimon Fickling from Exane, please. A first question on HDD and the Euro VI legislation there. The -- you flagged in this release and, I think, at Q3 that sort of early orders are filling the pipeline. An assessment, please, of where you think inventories are and the risk maybe for the next couple of quarters that orders are slightly softer and the momentum is slightly weaker given the level of inventories in the system. ECT, more broadly, process efficiency, is there much more to come in terms of that? And finally, on the M&A side, there's been a bit less in the year just ended. There's the A123 deal, but wondering sort of where that may focus, and perhaps an indication as well on appetite for bigger deals that could perhaps involve a rights issue or sort of more transformation on the portfolio.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Neil Carson (Executives)】\nOkay, Simon, thank you. HDD, John, Euro VI inventories, and is it all going to fall off a cliff?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Walker (Executives)】\nVisibility of inventory in Europe is less than in North America, for example, but the dreaded dip of the post prebuy, I think I can confidently say that, that's not happening in the first quarter. And I feel a little bit better that it's going to be less of an impact on the second quarter as well, but I still point out that we don't really know what the inventory situation is. So there could be a slight softening, but I would say that's probably less than we thought before. On process efficiencies, as you know, we just are finishing up our second phase of Macedonia and also finishing up the filter investment in Royston. And in particular, Macedonia, we're 3/4 of the way through to filling up, or we're 100% in filling up the first build and we're starting to increase the utilization of the second build. Line three has been up and running now for several months, and process efficiencies from that plant are very good and improving. So yes, I'd say there will still be more to come in terms of leveraging that investment.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Neil Carson (Executives)】\nAnd globally, the Manufacturing Excellence effort is having an effect everywhere in all 15 plants, so...\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Walker (Executives)】\nWe have a very embedded Manufacturing Excellence program right now, and that's going very well. So yes, I support Neil's comments there.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Neil Carson (Executives)】\nOn M&A, well, we don't make that much M&A, and it's because now in our -- most of our businesses, we've got higher market shares in small-ish markets, and the things we want to buy, we're not able to do. We have aspirations to make large M&A, but there's nothing particularly on the horizon, I have to say. But more of the M&A will be of the kind that we've seen with A123, so buying some specific assets that we need to give us a route to market for some of our new technologies in New Businesses. I think that will kind of sum it up. Is that okay? Lady in the middle of the back. And then you're Andrew [ph], aren't you? Yes, you are. Middle at the back?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Evgenia Molotova (Analysts)】\nIt's Evgenia Molotova from Berenberg. I have 3 questions. On ECT, on your improved product mix in diesel, how sustainable is -- I think it stopped working somehow -- how sustainable is the product mix improvement? And how long will this contract last? And also, just one question on the comparables. Will you still experience stronger growth because of this gain of this contract in the first half of the year? Just when did it start the product mix change? And the second question -- the third question is on pgm refining. So when primary miners are on strike, does it mean that you have higher competition because they can actually refine more of the secondary products because they don't get resource from the mining, or not?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Neil Carson (Executives)】\nYes, I don't think we were talking about one contract in the...\n\n---\n\n【質問: Evgenia Molotova (Analysts)】\nI didn't -- I meant as a whole.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Neil Carson (Executives)】\nYes. John, pretty sustainable product mix of the book [ph]?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Walker (Executives)】\nYes, I think the -- for at least the next several years, the trends that we're seeing are going to continue. So what we saw for the year ended, '13, '14, over the next 2 to 3 years, we should see something similar. Those extra filters that we have will remain. And again, it's not any one contract. It's a variety of things.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Neil Carson (Executives)】\nAnd then the new legislations coming along, which will add value again per vehicle. So we don't see this going backwards.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert MacLeod (Executives)】\nLet's just be clear on that. So just to be clear, that boosted the year we're in because, comparative to the year before, we didn't have that product mix benefit. So now it's in the comparatives. So now going forward, you're not going to have another boost. That contract is still there, so it's that we'll maintain that rather than drop like that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Evgenia Molotova (Analysts)】\nWhat I wanted to know is if contracts will still be the same.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Neil Carson (Executives)】\nI think our overall guidance remains the same, which is we -- in cars, we ought to outperform the market by a couple of percent in terms of our sales. We've done a little bit better than that in the last couple of years, but that will be the guidance that we'll have you take on. And yes, exactly the point that you made, the primary producers have got refineries not doing so much and so have the availability of capacity to compete in the secondary market, and that's something they'd really like to do. But as I also said, when mining comes back, maybe that will go away. I don't know. So it's not something that has shifted much, but it's been a depressor of the margins a little bit. Is that enough? Okay. Adam there, just in front.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Adam Collins (Analysts)】\nIt's Adam Collins, Liberum. A couple of questions, please, on the catalysts side. So firstly, on the platinum procurement risks associated with the strikes in South Africa, we've had roughly 20% of world supply offline for 4 months now, and even if they restarted today, it would be roughly 3 months before they could supply the market again. Clearly, you haven't had a problem so far. And there would appear to be quite a lot of plate supply out there but maybe some shortages around sponge. I wonder if you could just talk more broadly about your experience so far in getting the metal you need; and whether we need to worry, if strikes continue for the rest of the year, about this becoming a supply problem for you; and how, if that was the case, that mining powder business, whether a force majeure like that and supply problems that you're in would impact your business or whether there are some contractual arrangements for you to recover there. That's the first question.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Neil Carson (Executives)】\nThank you, Adam. So we're going to pause for breath, and I'll have Andrew -- or Alan answer that one for you, Alan Myers, who runs that business.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alan Myers (Executives)】\nYes. Thank you. So far, we've met all of our obligations to customers. As Neil talked -- pointed out, we built substantial stocks prior to knowing that the strike was coming. We've had a very strong conversion program of converting ingot to sponge in place for several months to meet our customer commitments. And really, we're in excellent position. We're the largest secondary refiner in the world. That gives us momentum that our competition doesn't have. And therefore, we really see no issue in the medium term. Obviously, if the strike went on for a long time, that would change the fundamentals of the whole marketplace, but today and for the medium term, we expect really no issue with supplying to our customers.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Neil Carson (Executives)】\nAnd with that changing the market fundamentals means much higher prices, which means potentially metal coming out of jewelry, metal coming out of lots of other applications through our refinery. We signed up agreements with other mines for more processing of primary supply too. So we're in about as best shape as anyone could be, although you're right to flag it as a long-term concern. [indiscernible]? Next question, yes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Adam Collins (Analysts)】\nYes, okay. The second question is on margin expansion in ECT, quite a noticeable uplift in the second half of last year. And I just wondered if you could sort of talk about what drove that. To what extent was that down to the diesel value add issues in light duty? Would it have quite a lot to do with the Euro VI ramp in HDD? I think, in the past, you've talked about the fact that the expansion of Euro VI HDD would be margin dilutive because of the high-value substrates in filters. You then adjust that to saying it would be broadly neutral for divisional margin. I suspect it may be actually accretive, from the look of the second half results. Is that the case? Would you expect margin to increase further in the coming year as HDD becomes a larger part of the sales basket?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Neil Carson (Executives)】\nJohn?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Walker (Executives)】\nThere's several reasons for margin improvement, but specifically on the heavy duty side, I guess one of the things that happened is that a large proportion of our European heavy duty sales were manufactured in Germany in the past. And as we especially entered the fourth quarter and now going forward, more of our heavy duty sales on the flow-through side are being made in Macedonia. So again, it's another efficiency benefit that is having a knock-on effect on margins. So yes, I...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Neil Carson (Executives)】\nSo it's alive, isn't it?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Walker (Executives)】\nYes, yes, and that's going to continue.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Neil Carson (Executives)】\nYes, so that's the major effect, I think.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Adam Collins (Analysts)】\nIn HDD?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Neil Carson (Executives)】\nNo, but the efficiency. I mean HDD has an -- is an element of it, but it's the efficiency of the newer plants and the benefits of the Manufacturing Excellence programs. You're looking skeptical, so have a word with John afterwards.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert MacLeod (Executives)】\nI'm sure he will.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Neil Carson (Executives)】\nYes. Thomas? Sorry, Andrew [ph], we'll get to you, but after that -- afterwards.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thomas Gilbert (Analysts)】\nTwo questions. Unless I fell asleep in the -- during the Capital Markets Day, you didn't talk a lot about the chloralkali catalysis. So is the reason you're flagging this now as a new opportunity in PT is that because the coal price has fallen, customers are starting to embrace the technology? Or do you -- did you have a breakthrough on the R&D side there? And can you sort of dimensionize your position in that chloralkali business relative to competition? And then the second one is more short term. Just clarifying, I mean some of the suppliers to the U.S. refinery industry, we're talking about revenues down 10% because of weather and outages. And you are saying U.S. Refining has been strong, will be strong. And so you're saying there was no impact of the weather on inventories in your business and just you're sailing through the U.S. Refining market like a knife through butter. Is that what you're saying?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Neil Carson (Executives)】\nLet's have Geoff handle that one. He's never used the weather as an excuse so far, so...\n\n---\n\n【回答: G. Otterman (Executives)】\nWell, we can now. Just on the first one, the chloralkali comment, well, I need to talk to Nick here because that's not a business that we do anything in.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Neil Carson (Executives)】\nHe's talking about VCM.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thomas Gilbert (Analysts)】\nYes, on VCM...\n\n---\n\n【回答: G. Otterman (Executives)】\nOh, VCM. Okay, on VCM side, yes. It's something we just bought technology from Jacobs. And we're also building a catalyst plant now in Shanghai to supply that market with a different technology.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Neil Carson (Executives)】\nDifferent technology. We invented some technology. We were sharing the technology with Jacobs half and half. We bought their half, so that's now a viable opportunity for the future.\n\n---\n\n【回答: G. Otterman (Executives)】\nAnd what -- we really like it. It's a mercury-free replacement catalyst for China, which we think will have good uptake over the next several years.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Neil Carson (Executives)】\nWhich is actually legislated for.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thomas Gilbert (Analysts)】\nThe -- so that's the legislation. Because the reason I'm asking is, when coal prices were high, the Chinese PVC or VCM, they were running 60% utilization. And now that the coal price is low, now they're running 85%, 90% [indiscernible]. But you're saying this legislation will be a...\n\n---\n\n【回答: G. Otterman (Executives)】\nWell, there's legislation to get rid of the mercury catalyst that's used presently. And the product we have should be a reasonable -- I wouldn't say quite drop-in on the old process, but we can retrofit the existing processes, and then going forward, we have the technology to go forward.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thomas Gilbert (Analysts)】\nAnd how much advantage do you have to competition on that mercury-free side?\n\n---\n\n【回答: G. Otterman (Executives)】\nWell, we're the only one that, I mean, we have patent position on it, we're the only ones right now. So on the weather question, I don't think we really saw any effect. And I'm not sure that we see it -- we're quite as sophisticated to tell what's -- what the effect is on -- from weather on some of our demand, yes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Neil Carson (Executives)】\nSo we're still selling out some additives and hydrogen gas.\n\n---\n\n【回答: G. Otterman (Executives)】\nSold, yes. We had a good year in the U.S. on both the hydrogen side and on additives, so we really didn't see any effect.\n\n---\n\n【回答: L. Pentz (Executives)】\nRemember, the additives bit of our business has 2 roles to play. There's an environmental role, okay, in which case there's still tightening of environmental requirements on petroleum refineries. So that's -- in the U.S., that's allowing us to add capacity, add sales.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Neil Carson (Executives)】\nThank you, Thomas. Andrew [ph]? Do you still have that question, Andrew [ph]? Yes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Attendee (Attendees)】\nSo it's really around New Businesses and particularly the A123 deal. You said you've bought some of it, not all of it. I just wonder if you could be a bit more detailed on that. So what have you left behind, and why? How does it link into Axeon, if at all? Why did you -- what was the specific attraction of this asset? And then staying with that whole new business enterprise, I just wondered what the definition of -- or some better definition of \"some time\" is, so sometime before the division moves into profit. I mean just a sense of the key drivers and a sense of the timetable. And then the second question is completely different, on -- back to HDD. We don't talk a lot -- or haven't talked a lot about the non-road business. And I see from your presentation, non-road is now 10% of HDD. I could be wrong. It feels a bit behind plan, but maybe I'm wrong. And I just wondered if you could just update us on what you're seeing in non-road.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Neil Carson (Executives)】\nNick, do you want to handle what we've actually bought from A123, and how it fits?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nick Garner (Executives)】\nI shall try. Andrew, your name right, the ambition in the batteries area for us has always been about the attachment in the materials side. That's the fit to us. It's tackling this challenge of the energy density, which is sort of the electrochemical barrier created by materials deficiencies in the current technologies. And so it's always been about materials production, and that's the assets we're buying out of A123. We've never been keen on the cell manufacturing space. It's not what we do. It's not what we want to do. It's about materials development. So we've got battery development capabilities which we're building, but we didn't have those manufacturing assets, which have current access and route into market, and that's what we're delivering. So to be quite specific, it's a manufacturing plant based in China and some of the technologies around that. That's what we're getting from A123. So relatively limited but allowing us a route to market. Is that satisfying?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Neil Carson (Executives)】\nAnd we get some business with it, too.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nick Garner (Executives)】\nI mean we get the ongoing business into A123, which is as a successful cell manufacturers. So that's what we signed up onto. And we have a long-term arrangement we are establishing with them.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Neil Carson (Executives)】\nThe second part of that question is a tougher one, in terms of predicting profits. I mean this is, by its very nature, difficult to predict. What we can tell you for sure is we've got some really strong technologies, but that's not all you need. You need to have a route to market. That's what Nick is putting in place in batteries. And you need some compliant customers who really like what you've got to offer, and that takes a number of years. So I don't think we can be all that more specific. We can be -- we can give you a -- you know what our target is for the long term, so from when we started a few years ago. It was to have a significant business out of one of these things, i.e. 200 million-ish of sales 10 years from when we started, and we're a good 3 or 4 years in.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert MacLeod (Executives)】\nThat's right. And I think we just got to be patient with this a bit. I mean, as Neil said in his earlier comment, I mean we've now got nearly GBP 600 million of sales in HDD, and the R&D of that started nearly 20 years ago. What we've got here is, if you take the loss that we've got, GBP 18 million, more than 1/2 of it's in the fuel cell business, which we've had for some time. So the rest of the investment is a relatively small component of the overall investment we're making as a business. And I think sort of GBP 8 million, GBP 9 million a year, x the fuel cell business, is probably not a bad place to -- yes, a reasonable amount of money, I think, to invest.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Neil Carson (Executives)】\nAnd the final part was non-road. I guess that we could refer you back to the wave chart that we've printed a while ago. And I don't know exactly what non-road ought to be, but by the end of 2015, it was -- I can't remember. Was it GBP 0.5 billion or something?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert MacLeod (Executives)】\n[indiscernible]\n\n---\n\n【回答: Neil Carson (Executives)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert MacLeod (Executives)】\nWell, how are we doing, John, there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Neil Carson (Executives)】\nYes?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Walker (Executives)】\nWell, in the year just ended, we grew our non-road sales by 21%, so in line with the growth in heavy duty. And I think the thing that's changed a little bit since we talked about this 1.5 years ago or 2 years ago is that there's probably less filters on some of the non-road applications than we had originally thought. So some engine manufacturers have found ways to buy tuning and other adjustments to be able to avoid putting filters onto as many engines as we thought when we first talked about this. So I guess, directionally, yes, you're right, the -- compared to what we first said, the non-road numbers will be down a little bit, not dramatically.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Neil Carson (Executives)】\nThank you. One in the front here.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Pick (Analysts)】\nCharles Pick of Numis. Three questions, please. You mentioned a slight market share loss in respect of Europe on the HDD side after the Euro VI came in. I just wonder, when did -- why that arose, please? In Asia, the LDV catalyst sales were up about 12% in the first half. It's about 19% for the full year. And there's mention of some extra business being secured in China. I wondered if you could sort of elaborate on that, please. And was it just in China you're gaining the extra business? And finally, on the Process Technologies side, there's mention of how some extra CapEx may be sanctioned. I wondered if you could give an indication of the scale of that, please.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Neil Carson (Executives)】\nMarket share loss, John, in HDD? We started, obviously, with a very high market share, which we never really expected to maintain, but -- and when the technology changes, there's an opportunity for our -- I think we've done pretty well, haven't we?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Walker (Executives)】\nYes. I think that it's kind of a mixing configuration thing. When some manufacturers made the change from Euro V to Euro VI, it changed the number of catalysts that were on some of the vehicles. So there was a -- it wasn't like we lost any business, but it effectively is a market share loss because the number of catalysts, in some cases, was lower on some of the European vehicles. But yes, we would say that, our heavy duty market share globally, we probably lost 5%. The other part of that has nothing to do with Europe, and that's just the natural dilution effect of the, as we talked earlier, 30%, 30%, 30% in China first getting [ph] because of the volumes as China comes on. It's just mathematics. So our market share number will be reducing globally because of that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Neil Carson (Executives)】\nAnd the Asian business, light duty, picked up a bit?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Walker (Executives)】\nAsian business. The big boom in Asia, I guess, was a combination of China, where we had some market share gains at -- in particular 2 customers, who will remain unnamed. And Southeast Asia, I think we've done very well. I think the scary thing is that if Thailand wasn't under martial law, we might have even done better, so...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Neil Carson (Executives)】\nAnd extra CapEx in PT?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert MacLeod (Executives)】\nYou asked -- the question was about our CapEx, or the customer's CapEx?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Pick (Analysts)】\n[indiscernible] in the statement as to how you're considering other opportunities that may increase the CapEx going forward.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Neil Carson (Executives)】\nAll right.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert MacLeod (Executives)】\nAll right. Yes, I mean this is, for us, it's -- I mean we're looking at investing in China to give us the facilities. And Geoff talked a little bit about VCM already and then also SNG assets maybe we need to put on the ground. And we're also investing in Germany to add capacity for our chemical catalysts too. So it's a range of things. And then there's always long-term opportunities as well with GTL, whether that -- if those come through in the U.S., then maybe we'll need some more capacity for those too, but that's a longer-term play.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Neil Carson (Executives)】\nThanks. John...\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Pick (Analysts)】\n[indiscernible] order of magnitude then.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert MacLeod (Executives)】\nNo order of magnitude today.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Neil Carson (Executives)】\nWe're going to stay within our guidance that you've got on Robert's bit in terms of the company. Thank you, Charles. One at the back there.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Peter Michaelis (Analysts)】\nPeter Michaelis from Alliance Trust Investments. Just on the sustainability side. I mean it's very impressive, what you've achieved over the last sort of 7 years. What's the ambition for the rest of the sustainability program? And where should we see it coming through? Is it a margin question, or is it actually improve your relationships with customers? Or where does it actually hit the profitability line?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Neil Carson (Executives)】\nIt's a journey that isn't complete, obviously. We're not at 2017 yet. We've hit one of our targets already, and we're pretty close to some of the others. So the job in the near term will be to set some more targets for the future and to go well past our 200th birthday. And where does it appear when it appears? All over the place in the numbers really but broadly on the cost side. So had we not reduced our electricity consumption per unit of sales by 44%, we'd be spending a lot more money on electricity. But this is not why the guys on the shop floor do this. They do this because they like the sustainability idea rather than the saving money idea. So that's what's gained a head of steam in Johnson Matthey, the fact that people think this is a thing they ought to be doing for when they're working for a company like JM. So it's a pretty powerful thing. And it fits now across -- it meshes very nicely now with Manufacturing Excellence, which if you would look at it from a different perspective is almost exactly the same kind of thing, so...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert MacLeod (Executives)】\nAnd it's also a very good motivator for our staff. I mean the graduates and the new employees, one of the things they like about coming to a company like Johnson Matthey is we do talk about sustainability and how it really matters. And so it's good for the bottom line, but it's also good for our employees and, hopefully, for all our stakeholders.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Neil Carson (Executives)】\nThank you, Peter. Any final questions before we draw a close?\r\nThen thank you very much, guys. It's been a pleasure working with you. Good luck for the future. Thank you.",

And here with me today are Ignacio Fernández, our CFO; and Marcos López, Capital Markets Director.\r\nThe results for the first quarter 2014 show that Inditex continues its global multi-concept, multi-channel growth. Inditex operating performance in the quarter has been strong. The store and online sales in local currencies have grown 11%. Our operations have also shown high efficiency and tight operating control over the period. Let me also tell you that in terms of expansion, our space growth and online launches for the year are on track. We have opened stores in 26 different markets over the period, demonstrating the global reach of Inditex business model. We have continued our global online rollout during the quarter. \r\nThe next steps will be the launch of online sales in South Korea and Mexico in September. We also plan to open Zara in Tmall in China over the Autumn-Winter season. We continue to see significant growth opportunities for Inditex globally. \r\nLet me now hand over to Ignacio, who will provide you some -- with some detail behind the headline numbers. And I will join you later for the outlook section.\n\n---\n\nThank you. In the first quarter 2014, Inditex achieved net sales of EUR 3.7 billion, EBITDA of EUR 732 million and net income of EUR 406 million. Inditex has had a strong operating performance. As you have seen in our financial release, currency translation due to the strong yield of business, several currencies has been the future of the period. \r\nTempe is a supplier of shoes and accessories for Inditex, in which Inditex has a 50% interest. According to the new IASB rule, it is mandatory to consolidate its 50% interest in Tempe according to the equity method. This interest was previously consolidated on a proportional basis. It is just a presentation issue on the profit and loss account with no impact on net income.\r\nStarting with sales. I want to tell you that Inditex sales performance in the quarter has been satisfactory. Store and online sales in local currencies have grown 11%. Reported sales have grown 4%. Evolution of currencies against the euro has deducted 6 percentage points from this line. Additionally, the change in the consolidation method of Tempe has deducted around 1% from reported sales. \r\nIn line with our comments at the time of our fiscal 2015 results, we expect the impact of currency translation to diminish markedly over 2014, so the currencies remain at current levels. Gross profit has increased 3% to EUR 2.2 billion, resulting in a 58.9% gross margin on sales. We have sustained our commercial policies over the period. \r\nOperating expenses are tightly under control. They have grown 6%, facilitating mainly the growth in the space, and include all the start-up costs from new openings. Operating working capital remains negative as a consequence of the business model. The working capital evolution is in line with the performance over the period. \r\nI will now hand over to Marcos, who will elaborate on the performance of the Inditex concepts.\n\n---\n\nIn terms of space addition and online launches, we are on track. Continuing with our global expansion, we have opened stores in 26 markets over the period. Regarding the performance by concept, in the first quarter of 2014, Zara and the younger concepts group, together, have performed broadly in line with each other with some minor differences. Regarding the younger concepts, Oysho, Uterqüe, Massimo Dutti and Zara Home have performed above the average, and Bershka below the average. \r\nI will now hand over to Pablo for the outlook section.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Marcos. With respect to expansion in 2014, let me highlight that space growth and online launches are on track. Regarding the outlook for the first half of 2014, I would like to add that the store sales in local currencies from the 1st of February to the 8th of June have grown by 11%. Inditex Board of Directors has proposed a 5-for-1 stock split to the general shareholders meeting to be held on 15th, July. If approved, each Inditex shareholder on record at the close of business on 25th, July will receive 5 new shares for every existing share held on the record date. Trading of the new shares will begin on 28th, July. For the rest of 2014, we will continue to invest, profitably expanding our business in a number of markets with attractive long-term returns through our multi-concept and multi-channel strategy. \r\nInditex is present on 5 continents and in all the key markets, demonstrating the group's global reach. We manage a diversified sales platform in 88 markets. The current base offers huge growth potential for the coming years. Inditex enjoys a fully-integrated, globally-scalable online operation, which fits perfectly into our business model. This has allowed a rapid growth of our online presence in conjunction with our retail expansion. We have established online sales in Europe, the United States, China, the Russian Federation, Japan and Canada, the world's main economies. We will continue rolling out online sales in selected markets to enhance our global presence. To this end, Zara will launch online sales in South Korea and Mexico in September. We also plan to open Zara in Tmall in China over the Autumn-Winter season. \r\nOur online operations take advantage of the central inventory position of our business model and employ online stockroom -- stockrooms to enhance last mile distribution. Following a strong online sales growth, we have opened our third European online stockroom in Poland in May to service Central Europe. We have also opened our second online stockroom in the United States, in Los Angeles to service the strong demand on the West Coast. \r\nBefore closing, I would like to cover a number of initiatives carried out by Inditex concepts and some selected store openings. Pull&Bear has opened a flagship store of 700 square meters at Milan's Corso Vittorio Emanuele. Massimo Dutti has recently launched a new store image that can be seen in its flagship at El Borne in Mallorca. Bershka has launched a new store image to be rolled out in all its new stores. Stradivarius has launched in Japan with a number of stores, including Tokyo Bay. Oysho has developed a new yoga collection and sponsors -- sponsored free yoga sessions in Milan, Madrid and Barcelona. Zara Home continues its expansion in Japan with a flagship store at Aoyama in Tokyo. Uterqüe has launched a new store image that is now being rolled out in all new openings. \r\nZara Serrano in Madrid is a flagship of 3,700 square meters with a new store image and very powerful architectural features. Zara has opened a flagship at Bahnhofstrasse in Zürich last Friday. This is one of the most relevant stores in Switzerland. Zara will open a global flagship at Queen's Road in Hong Kong in the coming days. This will be one of the most prominent stores in Asia. Zara is opening a flagship store at Miami's Lincoln Road today. This is one of our most high-profile stores in the United States. Zara has opened a flagship store at Figueroa in Downtown Los Angeles last Thursday. Zara has also opened at Seattle's Westlake Center with a very strong reception. We have opened a store in South Africa at Cresta Shopping Centre in Johannesburg. \r\nAnd finally, we would like to close this presentation with the Zara store opening at Chadswood in Sydney. And this is all from us. We will be pleased to answer any questions you may have.",

      "transcript_text3": "A question from my part on the operating expenditure expected in the second half of the year. Given the projects online that you have in H2, do you expect the OpEx growth to materially differ from what we've seen in Q1 and what you expect in Q2?\n\n---\n\nWell, in terms of operating expenses, first of all, we would like to say that we always manage very carefully costs. The main driver behind cost growth is always space growth. Then, of course, you had -- you must have in mind a like-for-like sales growth because we have part of the costs, which are variable and, of course, also currencies. Regarding currencies, the impact on currencies on costs, we always say that it is half of the impact on sales, more or less. So thinking about the year 2014, these will be the main drivers. What you were mentioning about online is not having any type of relevant impact that -- regarding our costs. We always try to have cost growth below a like-for-like sales growth, and this will continue being our target.\n\n---\n\nI've got 2 questions. First of all, on the online stockrooms, could you remind us how many of you -- how many of these you have around the world, and whether they act for all of the concepts, and not just Zara? And then secondly, on currency translation, what do you think the impact will be in Q2 and also the second half as things stand at the moment?\n\n---\n\nWell, regarding the online stockrooms, what you always must have in mind, and this is what we always have been mentioning, that our online operations is very scalable from every point of view. Well -- and also, first of all, as you perfectly know, and we were saying during the presentation that we believe very much in this multi-channel approach, having a complete integration between store sales, between stores, between online. We always say and you know that we have a lot of in-store deliveries, in-store returns, the possibility to order online from the stores, the way we manage returns. And then online is perfectly adapted to our business model. We have a central inventory position, which is helping us a lot. We have new garments every week, sending to all our stores in the world and, of course, being offered online. That is why our online business is very scalable. This, what we call online stockrooms, and we were mentioning during the presentation. Sometimes, we call these online stores. But for us, it's very easy because it is like a stockroom of our biggest store, being served by all our logistic platforms twice every week as any other store. And we were mentioning this in the presentation because, currently, in the last month of May, we have opened 2 additional ones, 1 in Poland. So now for Europe, we have 3, plus Russia, so we have 4. We have 1 in Madrid, 1 in the U.K., 1 in Poland, and the Russian one. And then in the U.S., we -- at the beginning, we had the Boston online stockroom, and we have very recently opened a new one in Los Angeles that, well, is very relevant for the West Coast demand. And also, it will mean improving our service because in most of the cases, we will have 1-day delivery as the standard delivery to our customers. And of course, as far as we are beginning our online operations in Mexico and South Korea, we will also have online stockrooms. Currently in Asia, we have in Shanghai, we have in Tokyo, we will have a new one in Seoul. And then this one in Mexico. Here, we are talking about Zara online stockrooms. You must have in mind that in many cases, the other brands are not selling online in some markets. So it is not exactly applicable to all the brands. For example, in Japan, we are only present with Zara. In the U.S., we are present with Zara, Massimo Dutti and Zara Home. There are other markets, of course, in which we are present with all the different brands, and then it has to do with volumes and so on. So this map we are presenting in the presentation is very specific about Zara. So globally, a very scalable operation, fully-integrated with our stores, and something which is a very, very relevant for us, central inventory position, which is, this is in one of the characteristics of our business model. So very scalable. If you remember, very short time ago, we were beginning our online operations with an online stockroom in Madrid, that was the beginning not so long ago. And you see now this global presence -- global online presence, so many different online stores or online stockrooms. So this is what I would say regarding your question. So very easy for us to continue opening online stores or to continue opening online stockrooms, which is a different way to call the same thing.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And the currency translation for Q2 and the second half?\n\n---\n\nYes. Perhaps, Marcos, you can elaborate a little bit on currencies.\n\n---\n\nYes. And as you have seen in our presentation in Slide #8, we clearly expect that the currency translation, should currencies remain at this levels, will drop markedly over the year. We have established minus 6% in this first quarter. But if things remain as they are, we mentioned at the end of last year that we were expecting a currency impact of around minus 3% for the whole year, and this remains the case. But what we're seeing is a very sharp drop on currency translation over the quarters, if things remain as they are.\n\n---\n\nI have a question about operating expenses. Could you detail the impact on operating expenses from the change in accounting for Tempe, and also the impact on depreciation and amortization for the group, please?\n\n---\n\nYes, Fraser. Thank you very much for this question. Very much what we mentioned in the presentation is that Tempe is a supplier of shoes and accessories for Inditex, in which Inditex has a 50% interest. As we have discussed, under a new IASB rule, joint agreements, the companies controlled by more than 1 shareholder, must be consolidated from 2014 under the equity method in the percentage of net income and not under proportional consolidation principles as before. That's a percentage of revenue line of the P&L. According to this rule, we have changed to this new method, and what we would like to tell you is this is a purely presentation issue with no impact on net income. The adjustment is just immaterial. It is around 1% in each of the profit and loss lines that you have described. And the net result is now included below EBIT in the line results from companies consolidated by the equity method. And just to give you an idea, last year in 2014 -- '13, to show that is totally immaterial, the impact would have been EUR 21 million.\n\n---\n\nEUR 21 million?\n\n---\n\nNow this is only for presentation and technical issue. And if you need further information, please get back to us.\n\n---\n\nSo it's operating expenses, it would've been EUR 21 million, yes?\n\n---\n\nAround 1% of each of the lines you have mentioned. This EUR 21 million in 2013, so immaterial. And again, it's just a presentation issue.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And sorry, to clarify on the...\n\n---\n\nAnd then neutral for net income.\n\n---\n\nOn net? Okay. On depreciation and amortization, the growth was very limited. But I think, last year, there were some provision write-back or something in the depreciation line. So how was the depreciation affected by this?\n\n---\n\nNo. You see, that was in the first quarter. But for the year, which is what we're discussing, is around 1%. It's still that in the depreciation line last year. There was a reversion of impairment, and this is why it is not a very good quarter to compare. But we're talking about the year. Again, the effects will be totally immaterial and net income neutral.\n\n---\n\nI've got 1 question on gross margins and 1 on store openings. On gross margins, I know you don't tend to discuss gross margins on a quarterly basis. But clearly, FX has had a much more significant effect than usual. Would you be prepared to tell us if all of the gross margin decline was caused by FX? And secondly, on store openings, you actually closed about 50 during the quarter. I think, previously, you've guided for 80 to 100 closures for the year. Is that still a number you'd stick by? And could you also tell us how many refurbs you did in the quarter of flagships?\n\n---\n\nYes. Well, regarding your first question, as you were saying, we don't like to elaborate very much on the gross margin on a quarterly basis. The gross margin, as you perfectly know, is a combination of many different things. It has to do with markups. It has to do with fashion trends. It has a lot to do with like-for-like sales growth. And you must have in mind that -- and of course, it has a lot to do with currencies. So in this first quarter gross margin, we have had a negative currency impact and a positive like-for-like sales growth impact because, as you see, the operating performance of the company has been very strong with this 11% sales growth on local currencies. So it's a combination of many different things. What we can tell you is that for the year, we continue seeing stable gross margin as we anticipated during last year's -- last full year's presentation in the month of March. So we'll continue seeing this stable gross margin during the year, knowing, as we always say, that is stable for us, means plus/minus 50 basis points. So a combination of many different things. Of course, when there is a negative currency impact on sales, there is a negative currency impact on the gross margin. And then, of course, when there is a strong like-for-like sales growth, as it is -- as it has been during this quarter, this has also a positive impact regarding the gross margin. And related with your second question, you must suggest the -- what we anticipated to you in March remains exactly the same. You must always have in mind that when you are thinking about absorptions, the first quarter is always the most relevant one because there are a lot of stores that we wait until the end of the Autumn-Winter sales to absorb them, no? So to absorb them at the end of the season. So it is always more relevant in the first quarter than in the other quarters. So the guidance that we gave to you in March remains exactly the same.\n\n---\n\nAnd flagship refurbishments, were there any major in the quarter?\n\n---\n\nWell, yes. But now in the normal way of doing things, of course, there are always relevant flagship refurbishments in every quarter -- sorry, in every year, but not with a significant impact in terms of the evolution of space conversion or in terms of the evolution of sales growth. So it was something very much in line with what could be the normal average of the group in terms of refurbishments.\n\n---\n\nAnd if I may, could you give a bit more detail on the Bershka new format, new flagship? And then that will be my last question.\n\n---\n\nWell, this has a lot to do with the commercial initiatives for our brands. You must always have in mind that, well, in every presentation when we talk about the new image of the -- this is something that -- this is happening permanently inside the company. So we always have the presentation of the new image of 1 brand, of 2 brands because our company is very, very active from a commercial point of view, so always trying to improve the image of the different brands. We pay a lot of attention to the stores. So very much in line with what is the normal evolution of the business and the commercial initiatives inside our company. We were also mentioning the new image of Uterqüe. So this is something which is -- Pull&Bear very recently, Massimo Dutti presented a new image also during these last few months, so this has a lot to do with the normal evolution of our business in the different brands.\n\n---\n\nA couple of questions, please. Firstly, in terms of your average transaction value online, I think, historically, it was maybe $100 to $120 or euros. Has that changed at all with the sort of more expansive coverage of the online proposition worldwide?\n\n---\n\nWhat we can tell you is that we're very satisfied with the online performance. What we have stated is that the online order tends to combine 3 to 4 items, and you know that our average selling price is EUR 15 to EUR 20, depending on the markets. So this is as far as we want to go right now. We're very satisfied. I think that the most relevant factor at this stage is that we're scaling online globally in a very, very easy way. And clearly, we believe that the combination of stores and online is the winning formula in this sector. And as we can combine the business model of online and other stores in a very, very natural way, we believe we have a lot of growth ahead of us in this matter.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And in terms of your pricing, has there been any sort of [ph] price adjustments and something that perhaps more currency from the core markets, like in Japan or in Russia? Has Inditex sort of implemented any price changes?\n\n---\n\nWell, in general, Rebecca, we are maintaining our prices stable in the different markets. They are always -- there could be some exceptions here and there. But our approach to the different markets is always a medium- and long-term approach. And globally, we could say that our pricing policy has remained stable. As I was mentioning to you, with some exceptions here and there, but our global approach is to maintain our prices stable in the different geographies. And then our idea in the countries in which there has been devaluations, we will try to compensate that more with like-for-like sales growth, with efficiencies in the way we manage our costs than through price increases. Always -- we always -- regarding any particular market, we always have in mind a medium- and long-term approach. We are a global company. We are operating in 88 different markets. There could be years in which we would have currency impact positive, negative in different geographies. And we are not at all adjusting immediately our prices in the different markets, always having in mind this medium- and long-term approach. And this will continue being the case.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And just finally -- sorry. According to your monitor, online accounts for 6% of the apparel market in Spain in 2013. Is that -- do you think that's a fair sort of statement? Or do you think your monitor have got it wrong?\n\n---\n\nSorry, Rebecca. But this final question, we didn't understand quite well because of the line.\n\n---\n\nSorry. According to your monitor, online accounts of 6% of Spanish apparel sales. Do you think that this is a fair number?\n\n---\n\nWe prefer not to elaborate about that. As Marcos was saying, our approach is a multichannel approach. Online is completely integrated with the stores. The online is perfectly adapted to our business model, and we prefer not to elaborate very much on the level of sales that it represents. Sorry. Thank you.\n\n---\n\nI'll stick to one question. Could you just talk a little bit about the Tmall agreement that you have reached for Zara, the motivations behind that and how the mechanics of the agreement will work?\n\n---\n\nWell, yes, as you know that we have decided to -- also to have our offer online in China through Tmall, typically, in most of the markets, our offer online is through our own web page. As we were saying, we always have said that there could be specific cases in which we would consider something different. I mean, in this case of Tmall, something which has been very, very relevant is that Zara operations in Tmall will be totally consistent with our image and our commercial proposition. So it's very similar to opening a store in a shopping mall, so our image -- it's very, very consistent with our image. And then the reason behind that is that, well, how relevant for us, is China and how relevant is Tmall in China. So first of all, that -- it will be our image. Second, that China is a very relevant market for us online -- a very relevant online market. And third, that Tmall is very relevant inside China. So we will continue selling online through our own web page, and we will also offer to our Chinese customers the possibility to buy through Tmall. In terms of how it works, it is nothing different to our online sales through our own web page. So it is like opening a store in a shopping mall. We are very happy, and we think it's something which is going to be very positive. And our Chinese customers will be very happy -- for our presence in Tmall.\n\n---\n\nA sort of question going back to your online stockrooms, can you say how that's helped your delivery times, whether you can actually get the product to customers faster and if you got any specific examples of that? And just as a follow-up, for Zara, in particular, can you say if online is now over 10% of sales in any of its markets?\n\n---\n\nWell, regarding the second part of your question, I would say the same, that we prefer not to elaborate very much on how much online represents. I'm sorry, but we would prefer this. It's very, very integrated with our stores, and we prefer not to elaborate very much. And then regarding the delivery times, you know that in all the markets, we have the possibility of in-store delivery, the possibility of a standard delivery and then the possibility of express delivery. And then regarding a standard delivery, in more and more of the cases, it is becoming 24 hours or 48 maximum -- the 48 hours maximum delivery because, of course, this idea of approaching the stock to where our customer is, is also helping in this direction. So typically, in the standard delivery, the real delivery takes place significantly before the maximum time that we announce to our customers, and this will be, for example, very evident for our West Coast customers. As I was saying to you, in most of the cases now, the standard delivery is beginning to take place the day after the order. So it's nearly a standard delivery, which becomes express delivery, approaching the stock to our customer is, for us, it's very easy, as I was saying to you before, because we have centralized the inventory. So it's just a stockroom. It's like opening a -- we were saying today that we have very recently opened a store -- a new store in L.A., in Figueroa Street, and we are saying that we have opened a new online store in L.A. So for us, it's very similar to opening a new store. So it's not an issue at all. It's opening -- as I always say, it's like opening a store without the store, only with the stockroom, like a big flagship, but only the stockroom. And then this flagship is receiving from our central logistic platforms twice per week, as any other flagship in the world. So it's very -- that is why it's very scalable, as I was mentioning to you before.\n\n---\n\nAnd do you see a noticeable sales improvement when you move standard delivery down to 24 hours?\n\n---\n\nWell, it's one of the elements. Of course, it's not the only one, but it's one of the elements. So well -- and also that we are servicing better our customers, which is very satisfactory for us, no? So it's -- of course, it's one of the different elements. Also, as you can imagine, from the point of view of costs, when we opened our second stockroom in the U.S., we are saving costs because we are saving a lot in transport when we're thinking about the deliveries to our customers in the West Coast.\n\n---\n\nFirst question, on the gross margin, in helping us analyze that a bit, could you shed some light on the average margin differential you've got between Europe and the emerging markets? And the second question, on store openings, given that your store growth is around 5.5% this quarter, but I do understand that the space growth must have been much higher, given that you opened your stores. Are you willing to tell us what the space growth is at this age, and whether there are any timing issues with your store openings and how that could develop into the rest of the year?\n\n---\n\nWell, regarding the gross margin, we always say that globally, we have in mind our 4 regions: Spain; Europe, x Spain; and Asia; and the Americas. There are not big differences regarding the margins in the different regions, and this continues being the case. And regarding our store opening plan, as we anticipated at the beginning of the year, space growth will be between 8% and 10%, which is also our long-term guidance, and this will continue being the case. Always, in terms of store openings, the second half of the year is more relevant than the first half. So everything is according to our plans, and the space growth will be between 8% to 10%.\n\n---\n\nOkay. If I may, one quick one on Tmall again. You know that you have very good brand recognition in China. What is behind your decision to move in Tmall? And would you be willing to comment a bit about the traffic on your Chinese website and how this has grown in the past quarter?\n\n---\n\nWell, about -- I would say the same I was saying before, no one when we were talking about this. Of course, we will continue selling online through our own web page, which is having a satisfactory evolution. And at the same time, we have considered appropriates, having in mind that in Tmall, we have our own image. So it's very, very consistent from an image point of view. And having in mind how relevant is China for us and how relevant is Tmall in China, we have decided to offer also our product online through Tmall. So nothing really -- nothing more to say. We think it's something very -- it's going to be something quite positive, and something that is going to be very appreciated by our customers. So there's nothing more to say.\n\n---\n\nAny comment on the traffic on your website in China?\n\n---\n\nNo. But we prefer not to enter into -- sorry, into the traffic in the specific regions. We have online presence in 27 different markets. So traffic globally is growing in a very significant way, particularly, as we always say, with mobile, with smartphones, with tablets. So traffic is growing in a very significantly way globally. And of course, this is applicable to the Chinese market.\n\n---\n\nGood morning, everybody. So we're going to go through the questions from the webcast platform. The first question is regarding online. In the past, you have mentioned that your online margins were not diluted, would this still be the case?\n\n---\n\nYes. This is -- of course, this continues being the case. We have developed -- or we are developing our online presence in all the different markets. And as we have said previously, we can confirm that our online margins are not at all diluted.\n\n---\n\nThe next question is regarding CapEx. Are there any comments regarding your CapEx expectations going forward?\n\n---\n\nWell, what I would say is that, as you perfectly know, the main driver of CapEx growth is space growth. Of course, there is also some CapEx which has to do with refurbishments, with logistics, with IT investments. Well, what we can say is that space growth will continue being, of course, the main driver behind CapEx growth. But having in mind that we have grown during the period of 2012 to 2014 through our relevant effort in terms of logistics, in terms of increasing our central -- the headquarters, we can say that in the coming years, CapEx growth will be below space growth.\n\n---\n\nOkay. We have some questions regarding Tmall and currency that have been covered during the presentation. So I think the last question is regarding the United States, you've mentioned some relevant openings during the presentation. Are there any comments that you want to make regarding your strategy in that market?\n\n---\n\nIt remains the same. A combination between relevant openings and online growth. It remains the same. Today, we were mentioning that last week, we were opening a relevant store in Figueroa Street in Downtown L.A., that today, we are opening a very relevant flagship in Lincoln Road in Miami. Well, this will continue being the case. And we are also saying that we have very recently opened an online stockroom in L.A. So it's a combination between relevant openings and online growth.\n\n---\n\nThank you. That concludes the questions from the webcast platform.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Thank you. Thank you very much. And in any case, as always, through our Capital Markets Department, we will be ready to answer any additional questions you may have. Thank you.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Cedric Lecasble (Analysts)】\nA question from my part on the operating expenditure expected in the second half of the year. Given the projects online that you have in H2, do you expect the OpEx growth to materially differ from what we've seen in Q1 and what you expect in Q2?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nWell, in terms of operating expenses, first of all, we would like to say that we always manage very carefully costs. The main driver behind cost growth is always space growth. Then, of course, you had -- you must have in mind a like-for-like sales growth because we have part of the costs, which are variable and, of course, also currencies. Regarding currencies, the impact on currencies on costs, we always say that it is half of the impact on sales, more or less. So thinking about the year 2014, these will be the main drivers. What you were mentioning about online is not having any type of relevant impact that -- regarding our costs. We always try to have cost growth below a like-for-like sales growth, and this will continue being our target.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Anne Critchlow (Analysts)】\nI've got 2 questions. First of all, on the online stockrooms, could you remind us how many of you -- how many of these you have around the world, and whether they act for all of the concepts, and not just Zara? And then secondly, on currency translation, what do you think the impact will be in Q2 and also the second half as things stand at the moment?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nWell, regarding the online stockrooms, what you always must have in mind, and this is what we always have been mentioning, that our online operations is very scalable from every point of view. Well -- and also, first of all, as you perfectly know, and we were saying during the presentation that we believe very much in this multi-channel approach, having a complete integration between store sales, between stores, between online. We always say and you know that we have a lot of in-store deliveries, in-store returns, the possibility to order online from the stores, the way we manage returns. And then online is perfectly adapted to our business model. We have a central inventory position, which is helping us a lot. We have new garments every week, sending to all our stores in the world and, of course, being offered online. That is why our online business is very scalable. This, what we call online stockrooms, and we were mentioning during the presentation. Sometimes, we call these online stores. But for us, it's very easy because it is like a stockroom of our biggest store, being served by all our logistic platforms twice every week as any other store. And we were mentioning this in the presentation because, currently, in the last month of May, we have opened 2 additional ones, 1 in Poland. So now for Europe, we have 3, plus Russia, so we have 4. We have 1 in Madrid, 1 in the U.K., 1 in Poland, and the Russian one. And then in the U.S., we -- at the beginning, we had the Boston online stockroom, and we have very recently opened a new one in Los Angeles that, well, is very relevant for the West Coast demand. And also, it will mean improving our service because in most of the cases, we will have 1-day delivery as the standard delivery to our customers. And of course, as far as we are beginning our online operations in Mexico and South Korea, we will also have online stockrooms. Currently in Asia, we have in Shanghai, we have in Tokyo, we will have a new one in Seoul. And then this one in Mexico. Here, we are talking about Zara online stockrooms. You must have in mind that in many cases, the other brands are not selling online in some markets. So it is not exactly applicable to all the brands. For example, in Japan, we are only present with Zara. In the U.S., we are present with Zara, Massimo Dutti and Zara Home. There are other markets, of course, in which we are present with all the different brands, and then it has to do with volumes and so on. So this map we are presenting in the presentation is very specific about Zara. So globally, a very scalable operation, fully-integrated with our stores, and something which is a very, very relevant for us, central inventory position, which is, this is in one of the characteristics of our business model. So very scalable. If you remember, very short time ago, we were beginning our online operations with an online stockroom in Madrid, that was the beginning not so long ago. And you see now this global presence -- global online presence, so many different online stores or online stockrooms. So this is what I would say regarding your question. So very easy for us to continue opening online stores or to continue opening online stockrooms, which is a different way to call the same thing.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Anne Critchlow (Analysts)】\nGreat. And the currency translation for Q2 and the second half?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nYes. Perhaps, Marcos, you can elaborate a little bit on currencies.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Marcos García (Executives)】\nYes. And as you have seen in our presentation in Slide #8, we clearly expect that the currency translation, should currencies remain at this levels, will drop markedly over the year. We have established minus 6% in this first quarter. But if things remain as they are, we mentioned at the end of last year that we were expecting a currency impact of around minus 3% for the whole year, and this remains the case. But what we're seeing is a very sharp drop on currency translation over the quarters, if things remain as they are.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Fraser Ramzan (Analysts)】\nI have a question about operating expenses. Could you detail the impact on operating expenses from the change in accounting for Tempe, and also the impact on depreciation and amortization for the group, please?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Marcos García (Executives)】\nYes, Fraser. Thank you very much for this question. Very much what we mentioned in the presentation is that Tempe is a supplier of shoes and accessories for Inditex, in which Inditex has a 50% interest. As we have discussed, under a new IASB rule, joint agreements, the companies controlled by more than 1 shareholder, must be consolidated from 2014 under the equity method in the percentage of net income and not under proportional consolidation principles as before. That's a percentage of revenue line of the P&L. According to this rule, we have changed to this new method, and what we would like to tell you is this is a purely presentation issue with no impact on net income. The adjustment is just immaterial. It is around 1% in each of the profit and loss lines that you have described. And the net result is now included below EBIT in the line results from companies consolidated by the equity method. And just to give you an idea, last year in 2014 -- '13, to show that is totally immaterial, the impact would have been EUR 21 million.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Fraser Ramzan (Analysts)】\nEUR 21 million?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Marcos García (Executives)】\nNow this is only for presentation and technical issue. And if you need further information, please get back to us.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Fraser Ramzan (Analysts)】\nSo it's operating expenses, it would've been EUR 21 million, yes?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Marcos García (Executives)】\nAround 1% of each of the lines you have mentioned. This EUR 21 million in 2013, so immaterial. And again, it's just a presentation issue.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Fraser Ramzan (Analysts)】\nOkay. And sorry, to clarify on the...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Marcos García (Executives)】\nAnd then neutral for net income.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Fraser Ramzan (Analysts)】\nOn net? Okay. On depreciation and amortization, the growth was very limited. But I think, last year, there were some provision write-back or something in the depreciation line. So how was the depreciation affected by this?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Marcos García (Executives)】\nNo. You see, that was in the first quarter. But for the year, which is what we're discussing, is around 1%. It's still that in the depreciation line last year. There was a reversion of impairment, and this is why it is not a very good quarter to compare. But we're talking about the year. Again, the effects will be totally immaterial and net income neutral.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Warwick Okines (Analysts)】\nI've got 1 question on gross margins and 1 on store openings. On gross margins, I know you don't tend to discuss gross margins on a quarterly basis. But clearly, FX has had a much more significant effect than usual. Would you be prepared to tell us if all of the gross margin decline was caused by FX? And secondly, on store openings, you actually closed about 50 during the quarter. I think, previously, you've guided for 80 to 100 closures for the year. Is that still a number you'd stick by? And could you also tell us how many refurbs you did in the quarter of flagships?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nYes. Well, regarding your first question, as you were saying, we don't like to elaborate very much on the gross margin on a quarterly basis. The gross margin, as you perfectly know, is a combination of many different things. It has to do with markups. It has to do with fashion trends. It has a lot to do with like-for-like sales growth. And you must have in mind that -- and of course, it has a lot to do with currencies. So in this first quarter gross margin, we have had a negative currency impact and a positive like-for-like sales growth impact because, as you see, the operating performance of the company has been very strong with this 11% sales growth on local currencies. So it's a combination of many different things. What we can tell you is that for the year, we continue seeing stable gross margin as we anticipated during last year's -- last full year's presentation in the month of March. So we'll continue seeing this stable gross margin during the year, knowing, as we always say, that is stable for us, means plus/minus 50 basis points. So a combination of many different things. Of course, when there is a negative currency impact on sales, there is a negative currency impact on the gross margin. And then, of course, when there is a strong like-for-like sales growth, as it is -- as it has been during this quarter, this has also a positive impact regarding the gross margin. And related with your second question, you must suggest the -- what we anticipated to you in March remains exactly the same. You must always have in mind that when you are thinking about absorptions, the first quarter is always the most relevant one because there are a lot of stores that we wait until the end of the Autumn-Winter sales to absorb them, no? So to absorb them at the end of the season. So it is always more relevant in the first quarter than in the other quarters. So the guidance that we gave to you in March remains exactly the same.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Warwick Okines (Analysts)】\nAnd flagship refurbishments, were there any major in the quarter?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nWell, yes. But now in the normal way of doing things, of course, there are always relevant flagship refurbishments in every quarter -- sorry, in every year, but not with a significant impact in terms of the evolution of space conversion or in terms of the evolution of sales growth. So it was something very much in line with what could be the normal average of the group in terms of refurbishments.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Warwick Okines (Analysts)】\nAnd if I may, could you give a bit more detail on the Bershka new format, new flagship? And then that will be my last question.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nWell, this has a lot to do with the commercial initiatives for our brands. You must always have in mind that, well, in every presentation when we talk about the new image of the -- this is something that -- this is happening permanently inside the company. So we always have the presentation of the new image of 1 brand, of 2 brands because our company is very, very active from a commercial point of view, so always trying to improve the image of the different brands. We pay a lot of attention to the stores. So very much in line with what is the normal evolution of the business and the commercial initiatives inside our company. We were also mentioning the new image of Uterqüe. So this is something which is -- Pull&Bear very recently, Massimo Dutti presented a new image also during these last few months, so this has a lot to do with the normal evolution of our business in the different brands.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rebecca McClellan (Analysts)】\nA couple of questions, please. Firstly, in terms of your average transaction value online, I think, historically, it was maybe $100 to $120 or euros. Has that changed at all with the sort of more expansive coverage of the online proposition worldwide?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Marcos García (Executives)】\nWhat we can tell you is that we're very satisfied with the online performance. What we have stated is that the online order tends to combine 3 to 4 items, and you know that our average selling price is EUR 15 to EUR 20, depending on the markets.

And globally, we could say that our pricing policy has remained stable. As I was mentioning to you, with some exceptions here and there, but our global approach is to maintain our prices stable in the different geographies. And then our idea in the countries in which there has been devaluations, we will try to compensate that more with like-for-like sales growth, with efficiencies in the way we manage our costs than through price increases. Always -- we always -- regarding any particular market, we always have in mind a medium- and long-term approach. We are a global company. We are operating in 88 different markets. There could be years in which we would have currency impact positive, negative in different geographies. And we are not at all adjusting immediately our prices in the different markets, always having in mind this medium- and long-term approach. And this will continue being the case.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rebecca McClellan (Analysts)】\nOkay. And just finally -- sorry. According to your monitor, online accounts for 6% of the apparel market in Spain in 2013. Is that -- do you think that's a fair sort of statement? Or do you think your monitor have got it wrong?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nSorry, Rebecca. But this final question, we didn't understand quite well because of the line.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rebecca McClellan (Analysts)】\nSorry. According to your monitor, online accounts of 6% of Spanish apparel sales. Do you think that this is a fair number?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nWe prefer not to elaborate about that. As Marcos was saying, our approach is a multichannel approach. Online is completely integrated with the stores. The online is perfectly adapted to our business model, and we prefer not to elaborate very much on the level of sales that it represents. Sorry. Thank you.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jamie Merriman (Analysts)】\nI'll stick to one question. Could you just talk a little bit about the Tmall agreement that you have reached for Zara, the motivations behind that and how the mechanics of the agreement will work?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nWell, yes, as you know that we have decided to -- also to have our offer online in China through Tmall, typically, in most of the markets, our offer online is through our own web page. As we were saying, we always have said that there could be specific cases in which we would consider something different. I mean, in this case of Tmall, something which has been very, very relevant is that Zara operations in Tmall will be totally consistent with our image and our commercial proposition. So it's very similar to opening a store in a shopping mall, so our image -- it's very, very consistent with our image. And then the reason behind that is that, well, how relevant for us, is China and how relevant is Tmall in China. So first of all, that -- it will be our image. Second, that China is a very relevant market for us online -- a very relevant online market. And third, that Tmall is very relevant inside China. So we will continue selling online through our own web page, and we will also offer to our Chinese customers the possibility to buy through Tmall. In terms of how it works, it is nothing different to our online sales through our own web page. So it is like opening a store in a shopping mall. We are very happy, and we think it's something which is going to be very positive. And our Chinese customers will be very happy -- for our presence in Tmall.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Hughes (Analysts)】\nA sort of question going back to your online stockrooms, can you say how that's helped your delivery times, whether you can actually get the product to customers faster and if you got any specific examples of that? And just as a follow-up, for Zara, in particular, can you say if online is now over 10% of sales in any of its markets?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nWell, regarding the second part of your question, I would say the same, that we prefer not to elaborate very much on how much online represents.

And then regarding a standard delivery, in more and more of the cases, it is becoming 24 hours or 48 maximum -- the 48 hours maximum delivery because, of course, this idea of approaching the stock to where our customer is, is also helping in this direction. So typically, in the standard delivery, the real delivery takes place significantly before the maximum time that we announce to our customers, and this will be, for example, very evident for our West Coast customers. As I was saying to you, in most of the cases now, the standard delivery is beginning to take place the day after the order. So it's nearly a standard delivery, which becomes express delivery, approaching the stock to our customer is, for us, it's very easy, as I was saying to you before, because we have centralized the inventory. So it's just a stockroom. It's like opening a -- we were saying today that we have very recently opened a store -- a new store in L.A., in Figueroa Street, and we are saying that we have opened a new online store in L.A. So for us, it's very similar to opening a new store. So it's not an issue at all. It's opening -- as I always say, it's like opening a store without the store, only with the stockroom, like a big flagship, but only the stockroom. And then this flagship is receiving from our central logistic platforms twice per week, as any other flagship in the world. So it's very -- that is why it's very scalable, as I was mentioning to you before.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Hughes (Analysts)】\nAnd do you see a noticeable sales improvement when you move standard delivery down to 24 hours?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nWell, it's one of the elements. Of course, it's not the only one, but it's one of the elements. So well -- and also that we are servicing better our customers, which is very satisfactory for us, no? So it's -- of course, it's one of the different elements. Also, as you can imagine, from the point of view of costs, when we opened our second stockroom in the U.S., we are saving costs because we are saving a lot in transport when we're thinking about the deliveries to our customers in the West Coast.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chris Chaviaras (Analysts)】\nFirst question, on the gross margin, in helping us analyze that a bit, could you shed some light on the average margin differential you've got between Europe and the emerging markets? And the second question, on store openings, given that your store growth is around 5.5% this quarter, but I do understand that the space growth must have been much higher, given that you opened your stores. Are you willing to tell us what the space growth is at this age, and whether there are any timing issues with your store openings and how that could develop into the rest of the year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nWell, regarding the gross margin, we always say that globally, we have in mind our 4 regions: Spain; Europe, x Spain; and Asia; and the Americas. There are not big differences regarding the margins in the different regions, and this continues being the case. And regarding our store opening plan, as we anticipated at the beginning of the year, space growth will be between 8% and 10%, which is also our long-term guidance, and this will continue being the case. Always, in terms of store openings, the second half of the year is more relevant than the first half. So everything is according to our plans, and the space growth will be between 8% to 10%.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chris Chaviaras (Analysts)】\nOkay. If I may, one quick one on Tmall again. You know that you have very good brand recognition in China. What is behind your decision to move in Tmall? And would you be willing to comment a bit about the traffic on your Chinese website and how this has grown in the past quarter?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nWell, about -- I would say the same I was saying before, no one when we were talking about this. Of course, we will continue selling online through our own web page, which is having a satisfactory evolution. And at the same time, we have considered appropriates, having in mind that in Tmall, we have our own image. So it's very, very consistent from an image point of view. And having in mind how relevant is China for us and how relevant is Tmall in China, we have decided to offer also our product online through Tmall. So nothing really -- nothing more to say. We think it's something very -- it's going to be something quite positive, and something that is going to be very appreciated by our customers. So there's nothing more to say.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chris Chaviaras (Analysts)】\nAny comment on the traffic on your website in China?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nNo. But we prefer not to enter into -- sorry, into the traffic in the specific regions. We have online presence in 27 different markets. So traffic globally is growing in a very significant way, particularly, as we always say, with mobile, with smartphones, with tablets. So traffic is growing in a very significantly way globally. And of course, this is applicable to the Chinese market.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nGood morning, everybody. So we're going to go through the questions from the webcast platform. The first question is regarding online. In the past, you have mentioned that your online margins were not diluted, would this still be the case?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nYes. This is -- of course, this continues being the case. We have developed -- or we are developing our online presence in all the different markets. And as we have said previously, we can confirm that our online margins are not at all diluted.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nThe next question is regarding CapEx. Are there any comments regarding your CapEx expectations going forward?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nWell, what I would say is that, as you perfectly know, the main driver of CapEx growth is space growth. Of course, there is also some CapEx which has to do with refurbishments, with logistics, with IT investments. Well, what we can say is that space growth will continue being, of course, the main driver behind CapEx growth. But having in mind that we have grown during the period of 2012 to 2014 through our relevant effort in terms of logistics, in terms of increasing our central -- the headquarters, we can say that in the coming years, CapEx growth will be below space growth.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nOkay. We have some questions regarding Tmall and currency that have been covered during the presentation. So I think the last question is regarding the United States, you've mentioned some relevant openings during the presentation. Are there any comments that you want to make regarding your strategy in that market?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nIt remains the same. A combination between relevant openings and online growth. It remains the same. Today, we were mentioning that last week, we were opening a relevant store in Figueroa Street in Downtown L.A., that today, we are opening a very relevant flagship in Lincoln Road in Miami. Well, this will continue being the case. And we are also saying that we have very recently opened an online stockroom in L.A. So it's a combination between relevant openings and online growth.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nThank you. That concludes the questions from the webcast platform.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nOkay. Thank you. Thank you very much. And in any case, as always, through our Capital Markets Department, we will be ready to answer any additional questions you may have. Thank you.",
