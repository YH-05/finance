Joining me on the call today are Bill Cobb, our President and CEO; and Greg Macfarlane, our CFO. Jason Houseworth, President, U.S. Tax Product Strategy and Development; and Mark Ciaramitaro, Vice President of Health Care, will be available during our Q&A session.\r\nIn connection with this call, we have posted today's press release on the Investor Relations website at hrblock.com. Some of the figures that we'll discuss today are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We've reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP figures in the schedules attached to our press release.\r\nBefore we begin our prepared remarks, I'd like to remind everyone that this call will include forward-looking statements as defined under the securities laws. Such statements are based on current information and management's expectations as of this date and are not guarantees of future performance. Forward-looking statements involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. As a result, our actual outcomes and results could differ materially.\r\nYou can learn more about these risks in our Form 10-K for fiscal 2014 and our other SEC filings. H&R Block undertakes no obligation to publicly update these risk factors or forward-looking statements.\r\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Bill.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Colby, and good afternoon, everyone. Earlier today, we announced our fiscal 2015 results. This has been a challenging tax season as the first year implementation of the Affordable Care Act and the continued and growing issue of tax fraud impacted the industry as a whole. We expected industry volume unit growth of approximately 1% to 2%, consistent with growth in employment, instead, total filings increased less than 1%, and assisted returns were essentially flat to the prior year.\r\nI'm pleased that despite these challenges, we delivered top line revenue growth for the third consecutive year. We saw positive changes in our assisted return mix. Our DIY business did very well, delivering 12% revenue growth on volume growth of 8%. Our tax professionals delivered expert ACA advise to our clients and are positioned to be trusted ACA advisers for years to come. We also successfully launched a timely new product, Tax Identity Shield, designed to combat the growing threat of tax identity theft faced by all Americans.\r\nGreg will provide more details on our fiscal year-end results later, but now, I'd like to focus on 3 specific areas: first, the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and its impact on the industry and our results; second, the growing reality of fraud within the industry; and third, our performance.\r\nLet's start with the ACA. Taxes in health care intersected for the first time this year, causing confusion and affecting refunds for millions. Prior to the season, we anticipated that 25% of our clients would be impacted in some way by the ACA, whether by completing an advanced premium tax credit reconciliation, claiming an exemption or paying a penalty. Actual results were below expectations, and we completed the season with 16% of our clients impacted as the greater number indicated that they were covered by nonmarketplace insurance than expected. Remember, this year, a tax payer did not have to provide documentation to make this claim, but that will change next year when a 1095-B or -C notice form will be required for a taxpayer to claim coverage.\r\nThe vast majority of our clients who were impacted either paid a penalty or claimed an exemption. The average penalty was $178, which was much higher than the $95 many taxpayers expected. For the small percentage of clients that completed an advance premium tax credit reconciliation, almost 2/3 underestimated their annual household income and had their refunds reduced an average of $729, representing a full 30% of their refund. 25% overestimated their household income and received, on average, an additional refund of $425.\r\nAs we've been saying for quite some time, it will be several years before the full impact of the ACA is felt. In fact, there are several important changes coming in just the next year. First, total marketplace enrollment is expected to increase over 65% to nearly 12 million people. Next, penalties for not obtaining health care will essentially double to $325 per adult or 2% of household income, whichever is greater. And finally, new documentation requirements will impact those taxpayers claiming to have employer-provided or private insurance.\r\nIt's clear that taxpayers will continue to feel the impact of the ACA through their tax returns for years to come. Because of the clients we serve, we believe H&R Block is the best-positioned tax-preparation company to meet taxpayers' ACA needs. And the work we have done has positioned us to be their trusted adviser going forward.\r\nNext, tax fraud continues to have a significant and growing impact on our country. Specifically, there are 2 areas in which our industry has seen significant trends over the past several years, tax identity theft and EITC fraud. We'll start by talking about tax identity theft.\r\nTo fully understand how tax identity theft occurs, let's walk through a typical scenario. A taxpayer prepares his tax return and electronically files it with the IRS. This return is rejected by the IRS because someone else, a fraudster, stole his personal information, prepared a fraudulent tax return in his name using a DIY product and filed it with the IRS to improperly receive a refund. The legitimate taxpayer then faces substantial paperwork to prove the return is fraudulent, which leads to lengthy interactions with government and legal authorities. It may take several months or even years of effort to resolve the theft, resulting in significant delays in receiving his tax refund.\r\nIn just 1 year, from 2012 to 2013, tax identity theft occurrences increased over 60%, from 1.8 million to 2.9 million. This increase of over 1 million returns is roughly the same amount as the assisted to DIY shift for the same time period. The stories I've heard from discussions with others in the business community regarding people impacted by tax identity theft have been shocking. And while we don't yet have official numbers from the last tax season, we believe the overall growth in this type of fraud will be stunning.\r\nTurning to the Earned Income Tax Credit. In 2014, the government estimated that 27% of all EITC returns contain errors, and that improper payments related to the EITC cost the U.S. Treasury $16 billion to $19 billion annually, up from an estimate of $13 billion to $15 billion just 1 year earlier. We believe this number will be even higher this year.\r\nAdditionally, for those obtaining the EITC, the disparity in requirements between assisted and DIY tax filings has been a factor influencing the material shift in EITC clients tax preparation methods. In fact, without the shift in EITC filings to DIY, assisted tax filings would have grown over the last several years.\r\nAdditionally, as we have seen through our acquisition and development efforts, fraudulent or inaccurate payments are not limited to the DIY space. There are numerous independent tax preparers whose tax preparation methods illegally achieve higher EITC payments and overall refunds for their clients at the expense of tax law compliance. Whether these efforts are purposeful or due to lack of understanding of tax regulations, it places those completing accurate and compliant returns, such as H&R Block at a disadvantage.\r\nH&R Block has been advocating for actions to address tax fraud for several years. Now meaningful attention within the tax preparation industry is finally being paid to these issues that continue to cause taxpayers billions of dollars. We have led the industry's fight against fraud, and we remain focused on advocating for change that benefits consumers by strengthening anti-fraud measures. There are some common sense solutions that should be implemented immediately, including minimum standards for paid tax preparers, parity between assisted and DIY returns for claiming refundable credits and more stringent information security measures within DIY tax software, such as uniform authentication requirements.\r\nI will be in Washington, D.C. later this week with the IRS commissioner and others in the industry to continue this discussion with the hope of implementing real change before the 2016 tax season. As investors and analysts, we believe it is important that you understand how serious this growing problem is. These matters require immediate attention, and we will continue to lead the charge to bring solutions to the industry.\r\nNow that I have provided some context on the season, I'd like to focus on our performance. For the third consecutive year, we grew the top line and delivered strong margins despite a decline in returns prepared by and through H&R Block of 0.1% to 24.2 million worldwide. This was primarily the result of a 4.4% decrease in returns prepared through our U.S. assisted offices to 13 million, which was mainly driven by the continued decline of returns containing the EITC and, to a lesser extent, the second year impact of the company's decision to discontinue the free federal 1040EZ promotion. The decline in volume also negatively impacted volumes of some of our Tax Plus products, including refund transfers and the H&R Block Emerald Prepaid MasterCard.\r\nDespite these challenges, we had numerous successes this season. Our DIY products had a very strong year, increasing revenues, return counts and market share. Considering the market pressure placed by our top competitor who gave away certain products for free, I'm very pleased with our revenue and volume share gains, which demonstrate H&R Block's outstanding user experience and effective marketing. And while we achieved an 8% increase in accepted e-files, I'm especially pleased in our 12% revenue growth, which outpaced the industry. Our advertising and promotion efforts were strong, increasing product awareness 6 points. And by improving our product and the overall user experience, we were better able to monetized and improved our mix.\r\nInternationally, our operations in Canada and Australia continued their strong performance, growing local currency revenue by 8%. Our Tax Plus products continue to provide tremendous value to our clients. We launched Tax Identity Shield, a timely product that helps to protect our clients from the growing threat of tax identity theft. Sold as a bundle with Peace of Mind, the product met our expectations and helped to drive Peace of Mind attach rates, which improved 2 points.\r\nOther products, such as the refund transfer and Emerald Card, were negatively impacted by the decline in volume and the shift away from EITC returns but continue to be profitable offerings that our clients value.\r\nAnd on an operational note, we were ready for the ACA. Our significant investments in training, systems and marketing ensured that we were well positioned to assist our clients who navigated the intersection between tax and health care for the first time this year.\r\nWe also focused on our infrastructure to ensure we are well positioned for success going forward. We implemented a new tax preparation tool in our assisted channel. The new software allows our tax professionals to better use their tax knowledge while providing an improved client experience. The majority of company-owned offices have now been upgraded to achieve a more welcoming, professional look and feel. And we purchased an integrated approximately 340 franchise offices into the company management structure that we believe are best suited to be company-run locations.\r\nIn summary, although this season had its challenges, we achieved much of what we set out to accomplish. We served our customers well, continue to deliver value to our shareholders, invested wisely with an eye towards the future and advocated for improvements within the industry. As we head into fiscal year 2016, we will capitalize on our successes and continue our focus on profitable growth, ensuring we continue to provide value to our clients and deliver for you, our shareholders.\r\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Greg to discuss our results in more detail.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Bill, and good afternoon, everybody. This year, we were able to achieve both top line and strong EBITDA margin growth despite a decline in total returns, the growing impact of fraud in the industry and the negative effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\r\nTotal revenues increased $54 million or 1.8% to $3.1 billion, and our adjusted EBITDA margin of 30.8% was slightly better than our guidance and was consistent with the prior year.\r\nEarnings per share from continuing operations on an adjusted non-GAAP basis declined 2.2% to $1.75. Free cash flow totaled $283 million, and the company ended the fiscal year with unrestricted cash of $2 billion.\r\nIn our tax services segment, U.S. assisted tax preparation fees and royalties combined increased 2.3% to $2.1 billion. This was the result of pricing increases, improved return mix and the impact of franchise acquisitions, which together, offset a 4.4% decrease in assisted returns prepared.\r\nI'd like to spend some time walking through the details of the increase in tax preparations and royalty revenues. First, we achieved price increases of approximately 3% this year, in line with our plans. We were pleased with the results of our pricing efforts, which were consistent in both our company-owned and franchise network. This does not include the impact of pricing related to the ACA or offers, such as the 50% off promotion. Second, we saw a mix improvement of approximately 2.4% due to declines in EITC and EZ returns and the impact of ACA-related forms. Finally, the remaining increase was due to the impact of franchise buybacks and discount controls, offset by the midseason 50% off promotion.\r\nNow as Bill mentioned, our DIY business had a very successful year. Increased product awareness and improved user experience and a well-designed promotions contributed to 8% client growth and improved monetization. The overall result was a 12% increase in digital tax return preparation revenue to $228 million.\r\nInternational return volume increased 4%, and local currency revenues increased 8%. The negative impact of foreign exchange rate translation, however, reduced current year revenues by $18 million. For the second consecutive year, Canada's tax season was extended to May 5, which resulted in a similar revenue shift out of fiscal 2015, as we experienced the previous year.\r\nTurning to our Tax Plus products. Both refund transfer and Emerald Card units were negatively impacted by lower versus assisted volume. Additionally, with a fewer EITC and 1040EZ clients, attach rates declined for both products. Overall, we sold approximately 5.1 million refund transfers and issued 2 million Emerald Cards.\r\nOffsetting the decline in volume and attach, Emerald Card average deposits and usage increased, which resulted in revenue of $51 per card, up from $44 in the prior year. This was a continuation of our multiyear effort to drive usage, which has resulted in a 40% increase in revenue per card since 2012. Additionally, Peace of Mind attach rates increased 2 points to 26.5%, and we achieved strong take rates with our new product, Tax Identity Shield. Because revenue is recognized over multiple years for Peace of Mind and over 2 years for Tax Identity Shield, the majority of the financial impact on increased volume for these products is not realized in the year of sale.\r\nOperating expenses increased 5.1% to $2.2 billion. Franchise acquisitions drove much of the increase, specifically resulting in higher occupancy and equipment expense of $12 million and amortization of $18 million. Additionally, the office upgrade Bill discussed increased depreciation and amortization by another $17 million. Because of the acquisitions and other infrastructure investments, depreciation and amortization is expected to remain elevated for the next few years at $170 million to $180 million. Approximately 1/3 of this amount is attributable to amortization of intangibles related to the repurchase of franchisees or acquisition of other businesses.\r\nMarketing cost and increased variable compensation also contributed to the increase in operating expenses.\r\nIn our corporate segment, pretax loss decreased $19 million to $80 million, mainly due to lower interest expense as a result of repaying the $400 million note in October of 2014. Additionally, the provision for losses related to our mortgage loans held for investment decreased as loan performance improved and property values increased.\r\nFinally, our effective tax rate was 34.5%, which was consistent with the prior year.\r\nTurning to discontinued operations. The net loss of $13 million was an improvement of $12 million from the prior year. As we discussed during the third quarter call, Sand Canyon entered into a settlement agreement with a counterparty related to certain of its representation and warranty obligations. This settlement was fully covered by prior accruals and was paid in the fiscal third quarter. Sand Canyon continues to engage in constructive settlement discussions with the counterparties from which it has received a significant majority of its asserted claims. At year end, the representation of accrual was $150 million. As a reminder, Sand Canyon is and always has been operated as a separate legal entity from H&R Block. We continue to believe our legal position is strong on any potential corporate veil-piercing arguments.\r\nTurning to cash flow and our balance sheet. We continue to maintain a strong financial position. By focusing on expense management, we have been able to invest significant dollars back into the business while achieving a 30.8% EBITDA margin.\r\nAfter dividends, we achieved free cash flow of $283 million in fiscal 2015. And as of April 30, total unrestricted cash was $2 billion, and total outstanding debt was $506 million.\r\nAs we have mentioned previously, until the bank sale is complete, we will continue to maintain the considerable amount of capital on our books due to regulatory requirements. While this year's free cash flow increased the amount of available capital, the pay down of our $400 million note in October offset that increase.\r\nAs such, we continue to expect to have approximately $1 billion of excess capital in the balance sheet when the bank deal closes. It is the desire of the board and management to use this capital and also incur some incremental net debt, while maintaining an investment-grade rating to return capital to shareholders. More details regarding the capital plan will be shared after the bank deal closes.\r\nBefore concluding, I would like to spend a few minutes talking about a key metric in the tax preparation industry, unit count. Unit or return count is widely used to evaluate performance in our industry. It is generally viewed as a proxy for market share. So given the differences in tax fire [ph] complexity and methods of filing, we believe that revenue share is a more relevant measure. And while unit count is viewed as an important measure, it is not clearly defined. One may assume that a unit equals a tax return, but this is not always the case. Consider the example of desktop software sold in a box at a retail location. When it's sold, it can be clearly counted as 1 unit. However, 1 box can be used to prepare multiple returns. Further, the unit count method used by 1 tax-preparation company may differ from other tax-preparation companies or even from the IRS. A tax preparation fraud becomes more prevalent. Without a defined methodology, we were not able to clearly quantify the impact, identity theft and other irregularities their having on unit counts. For more than 10 years, taxpayers have used an assisted tax preparation method approximately 60% of the time; and a DIY method, including software, the remaining 40%.\r\nIn the past 5 years, however, there has been a slow, gradual shift from assisted to DIY. Considering that the vast majority of tax identity fraud occurs to the DIY channel, in our opinion, this is impacting unit counts. For example, from 2012 to 2013, the number of tax identity theft victims increased by 1.1 million. In 2012, following the 60-40 filing pattern, approximately 700,000 of the returns would have been filed using a assisted method and approximately 400,000 using a DIY method. Then when the identity thefts occurred in 2013, virtually all 1.1 million of those returns would have been filed using a DIY method, effectively decreasing the returns prepared in the assisted channel by 700,000 returns.\r\nTo be crystal clear, we believe the shift from assisted to DIY is driven by fraud. In fact, if you took a reasonable position on the level of fraud in the DIY category, including tax identity theft and the EITC fraud, the DIY category actually declined over the past 5 years. Said differently, despite the increasing number of free DIY options, if we were to exclude the impact of fraud, we believe the proportion of DIY returns would have actually decreased while the proportion of assisted returns would have increased.\r\nHaving said all this, there is some benefit in providing unit counts. For this measure to be valuable, however, it's important it is clearly defined. Thus, we are taking a lead in fully disclosing how we define a unit. A key element of our account methodology is a need for a payment, which we believe discourages fraudsters.\r\nFor assisted returns, a unit is defined as a individual tax return that has been accepted by the client who has either paid for our services or settled with a refund transfer, regardless of whether the return was electronically filed or printed and mailed. This includes returns for both the current and prior tax years. Also included in our assisted returns are extensions in business returns, each of which account for less than 1% of assisted returns.\r\nFor desktop and online returns, we define a unit as a return that has been electronically filed and accepted by the IRS. We also count online returns purchased with a credit card and printed for mailing, which constitute a very small portion of our total. We do not count state-only returns as part of our desktop and online returns.\r\nNow that we have taken the first step and shared our unit count methodology, we strongly encourage others in the industry to provide transparency to the methods they use to record and report tax return units.\r\nNow with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Bill.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Greg. Before we conclude, I'd like to comment on H&R Block Bank. Let me be clear. While we respect the work of the regulators, we are frustrated by this process and the length of time it is taking for the transaction to come to conclusion. We continue to work with VMI [ph] and our regulators and believe that, on its merits, this transaction should be approved. We understand your desire for additional information as the approval process time line lengthens and appreciate your patience throughout this process. At this time, however, we do not have any additional information to share. We remain committed to providing updates when appropriate.\r\nTo wrap it up, we are pleased with our performance this year, growing revenues, gaining share in DIY, maintaining strong margins and advocating for industry-wide fraud controls. We're already at hard work the next tax season and are excited about what the future has in store.\r\nWith that, I'll now open it up for your questions. Operator?",

Our DIY products had a very strong year, increasing revenues, return counts and market share. Considering the market pressure placed by our top competitor who gave away certain products for free, I'm very pleased with our revenue and volume share gains, which demonstrate H&R Block's outstanding user experience and effective marketing. And while we achieved an 8% increase in accepted e-files, I'm especially pleased in our 12% revenue growth, which outpaced the industry. Our advertising and promotion efforts were strong, increasing product awareness 6 points. And by improving our product and the overall user experience, we were better able to monetized and improved our mix.\r\nInternationally, our operations in Canada and Australia continued their strong performance, growing local currency revenue by 8%. Our Tax Plus products continue to provide tremendous value to our clients. We launched Tax Identity Shield, a timely product that helps to protect our clients from the growing threat of tax identity theft. Sold as a bundle with Peace of Mind, the product met our expectations and helped to drive Peace of Mind attach rates, which improved 2 points.\r\nOther products, such as the refund transfer and Emerald Card, were negatively impacted by the decline in volume and the shift away from EITC returns but continue to be profitable offerings that our clients value.\r\nAnd on an operational note, we were ready for the ACA. Our significant investments in training, systems and marketing ensured that we were well positioned to assist our clients who navigated the intersection between tax and health care for the first time this year.\r\nWe also focused on our infrastructure to ensure we are well positioned for success going forward. We implemented a new tax preparation tool in our assisted channel. The new software allows our tax professionals to better use their tax knowledge while providing an improved client experience. The majority of company-owned offices have now been upgraded to achieve a more welcoming, professional look and feel. And we purchased an integrated approximately 340 franchise offices into the company management structure that we believe are best suited to be company-run locations.\r\nIn summary, although this season had its challenges, we achieved much of what we set out to accomplish. We served our customers well, continue to deliver value to our shareholders, invested wisely with an eye towards the future and advocated for improvements within the industry. As we head into fiscal year 2016, we will capitalize on our successes and continue our focus on profitable growth, ensuring we continue to provide value to our clients and deliver for you, our shareholders.\r\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Greg to discuss our results in more detail.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nThank you, Bill, and good afternoon, everybody. This year, we were able to achieve both top line and strong EBITDA margin growth despite a decline in total returns, the growing impact of fraud in the industry and the negative effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\r\nTotal revenues increased $54 million or 1.8% to $3.1 billion, and our adjusted EBITDA margin of 30.8% was slightly better than our guidance and was consistent with the prior year.\r\nEarnings per share from continuing operations on an adjusted non-GAAP basis declined 2.2% to $1.75. Free cash flow totaled $283 million, and the company ended the fiscal year with unrestricted cash of $2 billion.\r\nIn our tax services segment, U.S. assisted tax preparation fees and royalties combined increased 2.3% to $2.1 billion. This was the result of pricing increases, improved return mix and the impact of franchise acquisitions, which together, offset a 4.4% decrease in assisted returns prepared.\r\nI'd like to spend some time walking through the details of the increase in tax preparations and royalty revenues. First, we achieved price increases of approximately 3% this year, in line with our plans. We were pleased with the results of our pricing efforts, which were consistent in both our company-owned and franchise network. This does not include the impact of pricing related to the ACA or offers, such as the 50% off promotion. Second, we saw a mix improvement of approximately 2.4% due to declines in EITC and EZ returns and the impact of ACA-related forms. Finally, the remaining increase was due to the impact of franchise buybacks and discount controls, offset by the midseason 50% off promotion.\r\nNow as Bill mentioned, our DIY business had a very successful year. Increased product awareness and improved user experience and a well-designed promotions contributed to 8% client growth and improved monetization. The overall result was a 12% increase in digital tax return preparation revenue to $228 million.\r\nInternational return volume increased 4%, and local currency revenues increased 8%. The negative impact of foreign exchange rate translation, however, reduced current year revenues by $18 million. For the second consecutive year, Canada's tax season was extended to May 5, which resulted in a similar revenue shift out of fiscal 2015, as we experienced the previous year.\r\nTurning to our Tax Plus products. Both refund transfer and Emerald Card units were negatively impacted by lower versus assisted volume. Additionally, with a fewer EITC and 1040EZ clients, attach rates declined for both products. Overall, we sold approximately 5.1 million refund transfers and issued 2 million Emerald Cards.\r\nOffsetting the decline in volume and attach, Emerald Card average deposits and usage increased, which resulted in revenue of $51 per card, up from $44 in the prior year. This was a continuation of our multiyear effort to drive usage, which has resulted in a 40% increase in revenue per card since 2012. Additionally, Peace of Mind attach rates increased 2 points to 26.5%, and we achieved strong take rates with our new product, Tax Identity Shield. Because revenue is recognized over multiple years for Peace of Mind and over 2 years for Tax Identity Shield, the majority of the financial impact on increased volume for these products is not realized in the year of sale.\r\nOperating expenses increased 5.1% to $2.2 billion. Franchise acquisitions drove much of the increase, specifically resulting in higher occupancy and equipment expense of $12 million and amortization of $18 million. Additionally, the office upgrade Bill discussed increased depreciation and amortization by another $17 million. Because of the acquisitions and other infrastructure investments, depreciation and amortization is expected to remain elevated for the next few years at $170 million to $180 million. Approximately 1/3 of this amount is attributable to amortization of intangibles related to the repurchase of franchisees or acquisition of other businesses.\r\nMarketing cost and increased variable compensation also contributed to the increase in operating expenses.\r\nIn our corporate segment, pretax loss decreased $19 million to $80 million, mainly due to lower interest expense as a result of repaying the $400 million note in October of 2014. Additionally, the provision for losses related to our mortgage loans held for investment decreased as loan performance improved and property values increased.\r\nFinally, our effective tax rate was 34.5%, which was consistent with the prior year.\r\nTurning to discontinued operations. The net loss of $13 million was an improvement of $12 million from the prior year. As we discussed during the third quarter call, Sand Canyon entered into a settlement agreement with a counterparty related to certain of its representation and warranty obligations. This settlement was fully covered by prior accruals and was paid in the fiscal third quarter. Sand Canyon continues to engage in constructive settlement discussions with the counterparties from which it has received a significant majority of its asserted claims. At year end, the representation of accrual was $150 million. As a reminder, Sand Canyon is and always has been operated as a separate legal entity from H&R Block. We continue to believe our legal position is strong on any potential corporate veil-piercing arguments.\r\nTurning to cash flow and our balance sheet. We continue to maintain a strong financial position. By focusing on expense management, we have been able to invest significant dollars back into the business while achieving a 30.8% EBITDA margin.\r\nAfter dividends, we achieved free cash flow of $283 million in fiscal 2015. And as of April 30, total unrestricted cash was $2 billion, and total outstanding debt was $506 million.\r\nAs we have mentioned previously, until the bank sale is complete, we will continue to maintain the considerable amount of capital on our books due to regulatory requirements. While this year's free cash flow increased the amount of available capital, the pay down of our $400 million note in October offset that increase.\r\nAs such, we continue to expect to have approximately $1 billion of excess capital in the balance sheet when the bank deal closes. It is the desire of the board and management to use this capital and also incur some incremental net debt, while maintaining an investment-grade rating to return capital to shareholders. More details regarding the capital plan will be shared after the bank deal closes.\r\nBefore concluding, I would like to spend a few minutes talking about a key metric in the tax preparation industry, unit count. Unit or return count is widely used to evaluate performance in our industry. It is generally viewed as a proxy for market share. So given the differences in tax fire [ph] complexity and methods of filing, we believe that revenue share is a more relevant measure. And while unit count is viewed as an important measure, it is not clearly defined. One may assume that a unit equals a tax return, but this is not always the case. Consider the example of desktop software sold in a box at a retail location. When it's sold, it can be clearly counted as 1 unit. However, 1 box can be used to prepare multiple returns. Further, the unit count method used by 1 tax-preparation company may differ from other tax-preparation companies or even from the IRS. A tax preparation fraud becomes more prevalent. Without a defined methodology, we were not able to clearly quantify the impact, identity theft and other irregularities their having on unit counts. For more than 10 years, taxpayers have used an assisted tax preparation method approximately 60% of the time; and a DIY method, including software, the remaining 40%.\r\nIn the past 5 years, however, there has been a slow, gradual shift from assisted to DIY. Considering that the vast majority of tax identity fraud occurs to the DIY channel, in our opinion, this is impacting unit counts. For example, from 2012 to 2013, the number of tax identity theft victims increased by 1.1 million. In 2012, following the 60-40 filing pattern, approximately 700,000 of the returns would have been filed using a assisted method and approximately 400,000 using a DIY method. Then when the identity thefts occurred in 2013, virtually all 1.1 million of those returns would have been filed using a DIY method, effectively decreasing the returns prepared in the assisted channel by 700,000 returns.\r\nTo be crystal clear, we believe the shift from assisted to DIY is driven by fraud. In fact, if you took a reasonable position on the level of fraud in the DIY category, including tax identity theft and the EITC fraud, the DIY category actually declined over the past 5 years. Said differently, despite the increasing number of free DIY options, if we were to exclude the impact of fraud, we believe the proportion of DIY returns would have actually decreased while the proportion of assisted returns would have increased.\r\nHaving said all this, there is some benefit in providing unit counts. For this measure to be valuable, however, it's important it is clearly defined. Thus, we are taking a lead in fully disclosing how we define a unit. A key element of our account methodology is a need for a payment, which we believe discourages fraudsters.\r\nFor assisted returns, a unit is defined as a individual tax return that has been accepted by the client who has either paid for our services or settled with a refund transfer, regardless of whether the return was electronically filed or printed and mailed. This includes returns for both the current and prior tax years. Also included in our assisted returns are extensions in business returns, each of which account for less than 1% of assisted returns.\r\nFor desktop and online returns, we define a unit as a return that has been electronically filed and accepted by the IRS. We also count online returns purchased with a credit card and printed for mailing, which constitute a very small portion of our total. We do not count state-only returns as part of our desktop and online returns.\r\nNow that we have taken the first step and shared our unit count methodology, we strongly encourage others in the industry to provide transparency to the methods they use to record and report tax return units.\r\nNow with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Bill.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: William Cobb (Executives)】\nThanks, Greg. Before we conclude, I'd like to comment on H&R Block Bank. Let me be clear. While we respect the work of the regulators, we are frustrated by this process and the length of time it is taking for the transaction to come to conclusion. We continue to work with VMI [ph] and our regulators and believe that, on its merits, this transaction should be approved. We understand your desire for additional information as the approval process time line lengthens and appreciate your patience throughout this process. At this time, however, we do not have any additional information to share. We remain committed to providing updates when appropriate.\r\nTo wrap it up, we are pleased with our performance this year, growing revenues, gaining share in DIY, maintaining strong margins and advocating for industry-wide fraud controls. We're already at hard work the next tax season and are excited about what the future has in store.\r\nWith that, I'll now open it up for your questions. Operator?",
      "transcript_text3": "Bill, following up on the bank, the -- realize, no update at this time. Just curious, though, are you in regular dialogue with the regulators? Have you -- has it been radio silent for a while? Or is there interaction back and forth?\n\n---\n\nYes. Scott, I'm not going to comment on the specific work we're doing with the regulators. Suffice it to say that any questions they have, we answered timely and quickly. The discussions have been professional, courteous, thorough. And like I said, all along, on its merits, we believe the transaction will be approved.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Curious, on ACA, I think in the press release you mentioned 15% of Block clients ACA affected. I think that's a little lower than what Block anticipated going into the season. I'm just curious, is that, in fact, accurate? And what drove that? What do you think was the dynamic affecting it, if so?\n\n---\n\nYes. I'll have Mark comment in a second. I do want to say that while we did think that it was going to be upwards of 25% of our clients impacted, we have said repeatedly that this is going to unfold over a few years, that with all the consumer confusion and all of the -- really, the newness of taxes intersecting with health care that this was going to take a while to unfold. Now specifically, I'll let Mark speak to the difference between the 16% that actually occurred and the 25% we're anticipating.\n\n---\n\nYes. Scott, this is Mark. We came up with that figure out of 20% to 25% based upon kind of survey market research work. But what we found this past tax season is that more of our clients actually filed indicating coverage, nonmarketplace coverage for them and their household members. We think this is related to the fact that the IRS had really limited mechanisms in place, really, to enforce compliance. And a lot of people use the check box process as a way of avoiding ACA-related penalties.\n\n---\n\nGreat. A couple more, if I may. The franchise, the acquisitions of franchisees and the company-owned stores, Greg, any quantification of impact of that and -- to the extent you can comment? And then following up on that, what is the strategy going forward with regard to M&A and perhaps buying any additional franchisees.\n\n---\n\nYes. So we -- as we outlined back in the last quarter and then again, in December, we had a unique opportunity this year to buy back a number of our franchise locations that, at one point, were actually company-run territories. We think that the total population of those is somewhere in the 600 office range. This past season, we completed 341 store acquisitions. That was the old territory that we bought back. For the most part, we think that program is coming to the end of it, and we go back to our normal level of independent acquisitions, which were in every season, and while that ebbs and flows a little bit, we think it'll be in line with historical experience.\n\n---\n\nAnd Scott, I think this is a healthy piece for a franchisor to our enable franchisees to have an exit strategy. In addition to some of the acquisitions we made, we are also working with some of our franchisees who are looking to buy other franchisees. So this is a pretty dynamic environment we think is going to ultimately lead a healthier system.\n\n---\n\nOne final one, and I think I get it. Bill, you have a quote in the press release saying, \"Tax season challenging impacted by changes in the timing of tax filings.\" And I think Greg made -- may have answered it with regard to Canada. But I'm curious, should we read in any more to that? Is that what that comment was? Or were you alluding to something else?\n\n---\n\nNo, I think that, that's consistent with what we were getting.\n\n---\n\nYes. There's one subtly though, Scott, and it's actually one of those kind of important details that -- it's just an industry thing. But this season, there a lot more balance due clients than we had in the last several years. This is a situation where many Americas had an amount due to the IRS. And we know from many years ago, when that's true, they tend to wait later in the season to file. That's one of the reasons there was more of a back-end load this year. As an operational statement, that obviously would -- if we had known that better in advance, we would have better sort of a way we market it in terms of timing, our labor model and things like that. But in the grand scheme of things, it wasn't a huge issue, but it was one of the things that we spent a lot of time talking about.\n\n---\n\nSo return volumes were impacted this year by EITC-related filings. Can you discuss what your expectations are for the behavioral shifts associated with the EITC filers and if you expect stabilization or this is a structural issue where volumes will need to be made up for elsewhere?\n\n---\n\nWell, I think -- and Greg, if you want to add anything. There is -- there's a couple of components here. One is the shift of EITC filers from assisted to DIY that has occurred over the last 6 or 7 years, which we think is driven in large part by the disparity in documentation requirements between having to file with a paid preparer and having to file yourself. The other piece is the increase in fraud or improper payments, whatever term you want to use, that we have seen occurring with EITC filers, for this specifically. We continue to study this part of what I'm talking -- going to Washington so frequently for is to look at ways to -- this is not good for anybody to be having fraudulent returns filed and having improper payments taken from the U.S. Treasury. So I do think it is a combination of both of those issues, both of which can be solved with some common sense solutions.\r\nI don't know, Greg, if there's anything you want to add to that.\n\n---\n\nYes. Maybe I'll address the broader question you were asking as well, George. So an EIC form and the clients that use them, but the reality is this an area that has a traditional strength for H&R Block. We have a lot of experience with this type of client. We've got retail locations in a lot of the neighborhoods that bias that way. This is a complicated form that has very real consequences getting it wrong, and it is has very real consequences being it right as well. It has represented a very significant refund amount for those clients who are eligible. The fact that there is a problem here is not something -- in addition to the government strategy that Bill talked about, is not lost on Block. And we spending -- are spending a lot of time talking about other solutions, which, for competitive reasons, we're not going to get into right now. I will say that in December, we'll -- you'll probably hear more robust answer to this question.\n\n---\n\nVery helpful. And drilling deeper into the ACA impact, assuming that 25% of your clients were impacted by the ACA this year, how much of an additional mix benefit do you estimate you would have seen on a percentage basis?\n\n---\n\nYes, do you want to...\n\n---\n\nYes. I mean, we're not going to -- I'm not going to hit into a sort of hypothetical numbers here for you. What we do know is that Block is in the best position in the tax industry to take our clients through this challenging time the next -- this year and the years to come here. The Block client themselves is twice likely to be impacted by the ACA. We don't think that, as a general idea, is going to change much. I think that many people, for the first time, begin to realize that their taxes and health care decisions are related, and we believe that Block is in the best position to take advantage of those.\r\nMark, do you have a comment?\n\n---\n\nYes. And I -- probably, George, it would be good to mention that next year, we believe that things are going to kind of -- the ante is going to be upped even more. We're going to have penalties increasing, but one of the big substantial changes next year is we expect IRS compliance to increase. And because really everyone who has received any kind of coverage is going to have to provide that verification to a 1095-A, -B or -C. So we do think the combination of increased enrollment, increased penalties and, really, this verification process is going to increase the number of filers impacted by ACA going forward.\n\n---\n\nGot it. And you mentioned that about 2.4% mix impact is attributable to a combined combination of the EITC, the 1040EZ and the ACA. Is it possible to split out that 2.4% between those 3 components?\n\n---\n\nSo we stated that roughly 2/3 of the loss is more on the EIC and the 1/3 at EZ. Now offsetting that, of course, was we had a very successful mid-season promotion, the 50% off promotion. That was really targeted between the first peak and the second peak, so we call that the trough in the industry. And that was a very successful program where we found that we were able to attract a lot of high-value clients for the first year with the understanding that a high number of those will be retained for year 2, 3 and beyond.\n\n---\n\nGot it. And then lastly, digital is doing well in both sales and monetization. Can you discuss what product and marketing initiatives over the next 12 to 18 months you have in place to help drive the same share gains in digital?\n\n---\n\nYes, George. We're not going to talk specifically about the future, but I will let Jason address, generally, the journey we've been on, which I think has been quite successful. He's done a remarkable job leading that business. So why don't you talk, in general terms, about what we've been trying to do?\n\n---\n\nSure. And as you said, George, our goal every year is to outpace the industry in digital growth and improve our average revenue per user. And our results this year, plus 8% unit growth, plus 12% revenue growth, it really demonstrates the strong execution by our product team, delivering on what has been a multiyear product redesign. It has really started out as a journey just to make our product responsive, but what we've seen along the way is product innovation. And highlighted this year was our Refund Reveal feature. And I'm not going to give away a lot of where we're going, but I think that, that's really a great example of what I call intelligence to the service and what we're going to continue to see as features, which really help the user not only understand how they get the most refund back with H&R Block but also how the software really helps make the process a lot easier as they do their taxes.\n\n---\n\nA couple of related questions. In your prepared remarks, you talked about the fact that the regulator hasn't approved -- or isn't -- doesn't seem to have any merits for not approving the bank sale. It sounds like you're maybe implying that there's other factors at hand here. And if that's the case, and even if it's not the case, and the regulator is going to say an unknown period of time to approve it, doesn't that make this the new normal? And if it is the new normal and given in consideration of other things that you talked about in terms of volumes and unit accounting, how do you generate earnings growth on a sustainable basis going forward without a bank sale? How -- unit's been assisted regardless of accounting decline. Is that sustainable for you to be able to generate earnings growth for a full-on period of time with declining units within assisted, especially where this year, you've seen it dragged down your Tax Plus product as well? And then on margins, you talked about a range. In the past, you're still at the high end of that range with less revenue growth and again, the inability of buying back shares, wouldn't you want to stretch that margin target upwards in order to generate sustainable earnings per share gains even without the ability to get rid of the bank?\n\n---\n\nAll right. There is a lot there, Gil, so thank you for that. Let me take the beginning part and make sure that we're clear in terms of what we're saying on the bank update. And then Greg, I think if you want to take in, in general amount, pipe in if there's something you want to add. I don't think we wanted to indicate anything other than there's no information at this time. And while we're frustrated by the pace of the project, we don't see any reason why this wouldn't -- transaction would not be approved on its merits. Now -- so there's no signaling. There's no nothing on it, other than this seems to be taking long. That is from our perspective, and probably, many people would view it the same way. I'm not sure if the regulator does. And for those of you who deal with other banks and this whole industry, things are taking a long time in terms of any kind of deals that are being approved. I don't want to speak for the regulators, but I don't think they think this is -- I think they feel they're being thorough and complete as they approach this transaction. So while it's frustrating, while I would've thought we would've had an answer by now, there's nothing -- and hopefully, we've gotten this through, there's nothing that indicate that anything other than this will move forward. However, the timing is something that is still in the hands of the regulators. And I think from their perspective, and again, I can't speak for them, I don't think they're going to speak about this, I think the timing is consistent with some of the ways they look at other deals. Now as for what the implications of that are, and again, I think everyone of us -- also, I want to be very clear, we are very -- we are not going to change our minds, if you will. We do not want to be regulated as a savings and loan holding company any further. And we will -- we are -- our intention is to exit on our holding -- owning our own bank. So in terms of share counts and things like that, we'll get to that at the appropriate time. But our intent has never wavered on this with -- this is a particular transaction. We believe it will be approved, but that is not going to waver.\r\nNow as for the long-term growth, let me turn that over to Greg.\n\n---\n\nYes. And the broader point that you're making, really, is about the investment pieces. And what I would say is that we continue to believe very strongly that our investment pieces remain true, specifically the growth levers that we've got, international growth, our digital growth. Our Tax Plus strategy, we believe is on our favorable tailwind in this business. We've had a good story on pricing. We've had a good story on mix. The unit count has been disappointing, but we're narrowing down the issue. And actually, if you sort of neutralize just this past season, for -- you guys have seen EZ, we actually grew, and that's exactly what we wanted to do. Importantly and something that we've about before is, that's why I got on this in my prepared remarks is that all units are not created equal. In fact, if you look at the lifetime value, there is a major discrepancy between a more -- sort of a more sophisticated tax return client and what one that has a more simple return. So as an example, our decision to get rid of EZ was the right decision then, and we continue to believe it was the right decision. We gave up a lot of units, but the overall client experience of those clients to the left are better. Now we're going to have a deeper relationship with them, and they're higher-value clients from a financial perspective. The EIC solution is one that we're working on. There's multiple solutions that we're talking about. We talked about a couple of them publicly. We've got a couple of other ideas there. That's one that we will be addressing more formally as we get into the next tax season. But overall, we believe very much that the investment pieces around the growth company remain solid here.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Let me just follow up on one aspect here. It's great to hear about your resolve about not wanting to be in the bank charter business is unchanged, is there not a possibility for you to unwind the bank without having to sell it, and therefore, not have to go through that, say, regulatory approval cycle? Is that not a possibility that you would have if this process was to keep going on or will this end with an unfavorable ruling?\n\n---\n\nYes. So -- I mean, the important point, number one, is what Bill said, is we're going to get out of this business, right? That's just something we've committed to do. We will get it figured out. It's been frustrating, but we believe that the transaction we've been in into, both being talked about with all of you many times, is the way to go. As a hypothetical, in the event that doesn't work out, was sort of the next backup. There is a way to separate the going forward bank support that this company needs to continue to sell Tax Plus products, which we're very committed to, and the actual formalities involved of having a bank balance sheet. So effectively, we want to still be in the business of offering bank products, and we need a partner bank to do that. So think of that as one transaction. We do have a legacy bank. We've got deposits. We've got liabilities. Other liabilities, we've got assets that require a bank charter seating to find a home for those. So that would be -- have to be a second step of that transaction. And frankly, it's really the second part that's really the hang up in terms of getting that taken care of because whoever buys those will need to get approval from their regulator. Put clearly, if you keep it small and go to a much larger bank, it makes a little bit easier because these are all considerations that we've got. But really, just to finish up my kind of response to your question, the plan that we have with BofI is the right plan to [indiscernible] on the merits it will be approved.\n\n---\n\nOn the bank sale, at the end of April, on earnings, BofI said that they believe their positive resolution would happen relatively soon. Do you share their kind of timing optimism at all?\n\n---\n\nWell, I'm out of the forecasting business. I think what we shared and that we continue to work very closely with BofI. We're both -- we're committed to them. I think they're a terrific partner. We think the deal is going to be approved. But I -- as for timing, I -- we've been wrong a couple of times on this, that's why I'm out of the timing business.\n\n---\n\nI mean, you have to keep in mind that -- I mean, we can be optimistic. They can be optimistic. But we're not the one who's making the decision here. It's up to our regulators. So I think it -- our position on this, it's just better not to comment. Greg and the BofI guys can do what they can -- what they want to do. But I don't think there's any difference of opinion, overall. It's really just how we want to represent the decision of the greater estimate.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then, Greg, as an answer to the last question, you talked about potentially winding down about -- or restructuring the transaction. As it stands, if I remember correctly, you estimated it'd be about -- the sale to BofI, the dilution would be about $0.07 to $0.09 a year. If you were to go down kind of plan B, any help on how to think about the ongoing dilution?\n\n---\n\nOkay. I mean, just to be clear, I talked about it as a hypothetical. I didn't say there was any plans for restructuring by any means. And I guess the specific answer to your question is -- the best estimate I could give you is in line with what we currently understand, the $0.07 to $0.09. But it would clearly be a reflection of if there was feedback from a regulator. A different party may have a different viewpoint when they structure it differently. But I couldn't answer those questions specifically right now, so I'd say $0.07 to $0.09 is still the right number.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then just final question for me. So your survey work has suggested that 25% of your filers will be impacted by ACA, came in at 16%. You obviously invested some money both onetime and then ongoing in terms of ACA. Have you thought about -- at all, about rightsizing the investment? You're very good at kind of driving efficiency a few years ago. I'm just wondering if you think your shares [ph]are something similar now.\n\n---\n\nYes. I think, Thomas, we're obviously looking to starting our planning for '16, and we'll take a look at that. But I do think the investment we made in training, in marketing that really established us certainly from the research we've gotten back as the people to turn in to when it comes to the -- this issue. I think our people were very well prepared, handled all of the simple and complex areas of this tax law change. I think our feedback on our marketing efforts was very strong. So it was an investment, I think, that we've established that. Therefore, do we have to spend that same level, probably not, but we're not prepared at this point to get into the specifics going forward. You'll obviously hear more about that in December.\n\n---\n\nBut just to be clear, that is not a reflection. We continue to be very bullish about the ACA in our business. Reduction in investment is really just a reflection of the 1 year startup cost going away theoretically.\n\n---\n\nYes. And I also think -- and also, I think all the feedback we've got, which I think shows that, that investment was worthwhile.\n\n---\n\nFirst off, I just wanted to touch on the decline attributable to their EZ clients. Do you have any sense as to how these clients may react next year? Do you foresee any sort of a carryover impact you saw this year into next? Or do you believe that we've worked through most of that decline?\n\n---\n\nYes. So we think that most of the impact of the decision has been worked through the system at this point. So it's really going to be a -- mostly a nonissue for us last year. And just as a reminder, I mean, we ran this sort of free EZ promotion for several years. It had a life. We did a lot of financial assessment of the value of those clients, retention of those lines, propensity to buy new products. We believe that the program has run of life -- we terminate the products, of course, there was that 1 year benefit because they started charging for it again, but we lost a lot of units. There was a bit of an echo effect of this year. But to be clear, our research and our belief is that a lot of those clients who left us are extremely price-sensitive, and all they will do is continue to shop around. They're not loyal to any particular company, so any company that's sort of declaring victory over capturing a bunch of those units, I think, is a little bit misguided in what the real right value those clients are, unless they keep their prices at the low end.\n\n---\n\nOkay, got it. And sorry to belabor this point, but the 25% of your clients being impacted that you talked about at the Analyst Day versus the 16% you saw, do you still think the true number is 25%? Is -- was the result this year just impacted by really no control around documentation? Just wondering if you still believe the 25% figure is the accurate one or is it -- if it's closer to the 16%.\n\n---\n\nI'll take the first part, and then Mark, you should -- you add your perspective. I do think it is. I think it's a combination of not only the documentation requirements that will enhance next year but also the sheer number of people who are going to be enrolled in the exchanges, coupled with, I think, a greater awareness that this is something that you have to comply with. But Go ahead, Mark.\n\n---\n\nYes. I think the Supreme Court ruling notwithstanding that, really, you -- if you look at the drivers of volume going forward, Bill already mentioned them. Compliance is a big factor. We think that, that obviously explained one of the big area of the shortfall this year. But just the doubling of enrollment and the continuing clients in enrollment, if you look at the CBO estimates, eventually climbing close to 20 million, will have a significant impact on the number of people impacted by ACA. So we absolutely believe, over the long run, that will be in that 20% to 25% range.\n\n---\n\nYes. I think I will add. I think that if you go back to our statements, we did -- we have believed all along that we didn't -- sort of -- we kept hedging on the first year. We weren't sure where we were going to land. Okay, so now we have, if you will, a baseline. So we have felt all along that this would take a few years to really unfold, and we'll see if that's true. But we do believe it will be.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Got it. I'm not sure if I missed this, but another one on ACA. I realize there was a lot of confusion and delay in mailing out the forms from the IRS. But did the sort of profile of the clients that were ACA impacted, could you discuss how many of those were assisted versus DIY? Was there any shared shift from those clients that were H&R Block clients last year? Just hoping to better understand what the dynamics are between assisted and DIY as it relates to the ACA-impacted population.\n\n---\n\nYes. What I would say, and then Mark, correct me if I don't augment this, there was -- the impact was about the same between both assisted and DIY. There was not much of a shift either way. I think, primarily, because as people walked in using their filing methods and many, many people, the high, high percentage in this industry, stay within their filing method, there is some degree of switching, but I think that contributed to that. So there was not a material shift, and the impact was about the same, whether you sought assistance or did it yourself.\n\n---\n\nYes. I think a slightly -- just slightly higher in the assisted side, Bill, because of the client mix there. But I agree, we did not see any significant evidence of shifting going forward. That doesn't mean that as complexity increases with more people having to go through the reconciliation process and really facing the refund impacts of that, that we aren't going to see the potential for some shifting going forward. What we have learned this year is that when people do see refund impact -- impacts and we do see delays in the issuing of forms and corrective forms, that does have the potential to alter both filing behavior, timing and method. But we didn't see substantial impacts this year.\n\n---\n\nOkay, got it. And one final one for me. If you could just help us with what retention rates look like in DIY and assisted on -- in the latter, particularly, for the, let's say, the non-EZ filers and how that might have compared to your branded retail competitors?\n\n---\n\nDo you want to take that or...\n\n---\n\nYes. They were actually very pleased with our retention overall in the assisted side. They crept up. It wasn't quite a point but a little bit shy of that. So all things being equally, which included, by the way, the issues we've talked about, so that's actually a very good result.\r\nAnd then, Jason, you want to about DIY?\n\n---\n\nYes, on the online side, although I still think we have a lot of room for growth, in online, we were up about 200 basis points; and in desktop software, we were up about 160 basis points.\n\n---\n\nI apologize for going back to the bank with a couple of quick follow-up questions. If the deal does go through, can you just remind us what steps are needed and the time line for any potential capital return?\n\n---\n\nHappy to. So upon receipt of regulatory approval, what would happen is at that point we would have, what I would call, mechanical close process with both the -- the steps themselves are really administrative in nature. We don't have, for example, financing contingencies or things like that. The amount of time, there's like client notices, there's like articles and corporation you have to exchange. There's some bid transfers you have to go through and just very mechanical things. That would be somewhere between 30 to 45 days. Our preference is typically to try to close the transaction at the end of a month. It just makes all the accounting easier. So that might just have to factor in. But the 30 to 45 days would take to close the transaction, and we would think effectively means not precisely but effectively, that at the same point, we would then no longer be deemed to savings and loan holding company. So call that concurrent as it were. And then at that point, we'd wash our hands. BofI would then be responsible for our tax products going forward that bank-related, and we'd look forward to a successful tax season with them really running the engine for us. That would be how the process works.\n\n---\n\nAnd then again, after that, is there any issue in terms of timing for you with being able to return capital to shareholders?\n\n---\n\nWell, I mean, there's always a consideration. We have a historical blackout period and things like that but these are things that we well understand. And our intent would be, of course, just given the time line that we've already gone through, to be fairly quick and expeditious in getting information back to the shareholder base about what our plans and thinking would be. So I'd say it's fairly much when we close is we get up and to start talking to people more publicly what our plans and thinking are.\n\n---\n\nOkay, that's great. And then if the deal does not happen, any restrictions on the share repurchase and any increase in dividends? Are they still enforced?\n\n---\n\nSo we are a savings and loan holding company at the parent company level and we're actually regulated by the Federal Reserve Bank. That's the parent company regulated -- the bank itself is regulated by the OCC. So we follow the parent company under all the capital requirements and things that bank holding companies typically are. We have been in a period now for 2 years effectively, where we've been building capital to meet those requirements. We don't believe there's any issues with the pace at which we're doing that, so that's one thing I just sort of set aside. Then of course, when the bank transaction completes, at that point we start with the $1 billion number we mentioned earlier and then any potential incremental debt we may want to raise, and of course, it also has impacted go-forward capital policy at that point.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then if I could just focus back on the core business, I know it's still too early to look at fiscal year 2016 and with the caveat you gave us regarding just looking at volume growth. But with that being said, is there any reason that we should not expect the industry volume growth to increase 1% to 2% next year as you thought might have occurred in 2015?\n\n---\n\nJeff, I mean, that's a great question that obviously we're contemplating right now. We were surprised this year that the unit count was under 1%. So we're studying that. I'm not trying to kick the can down the road, but I guess I am to December. We'll look at that. You would not -- there is no obvious reason why it wouldn't -- it's been pretty consistent for 50-plus years, pretty much in line with nonfarm [ph] employment, but we've got to study what -- when we get the full information, which, frankly, from the IRS perspective we really don't get until the fall, then we can really understand why we're short this year. So more to come, but your supposition is not a bad one. But we were surprised this year with the growth in employment and everything that it didn't even to some extent go toward the higher end of that 1% to 2% range.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Fair enough. And just a couple of quick modeling questions for fiscal year '16? What tax rate should we be using and what should we be modeling for both capital spending and any potential franchise or purchases?\n\n---\n\nYes, I mean, we can certainly get into more detailed conversation offline. But in general, I would say that at this point, we've had great success in the tax rate this year with 34.5%, in line with last year. A lot of reasons for that were special one-offs type things and that we've had a couple good years there. So we're pretty happy with that. But what we said is the core based tax rate that the company continues to be at the 38% to 39% range. At some point in the near future, we'll give you a better indicator when we think that will be long term, but for now I keep it there. And then as we've said consistently we think the right CapEx level for this company is really between 3% and 4% of revenues. It's been a little higher than that or  trended toward the high end really as we made up a few years several years ago that were underspent, but we think we revert back to 3%, 4%. That's the best guidance I can give you.\n\n---\n\nAll right. Great. And any potential franchise or purchases built in?\n\n---\n\nNothing just like we've seen this year would be my position.\n\n---\n\nBut we will continue on that path, as Greg said, in terms of we're in discussions right now. That usually occurs after the tax season. It takes a while. So we don't really have anything to report except we will probably proceed in that manner again but, as Greg said, not to the level that we did this past year.\n\n---\n\nSo following up on a couple of things that have discussed, one, ACA, could you give us the cost that you incurred this year for ACA? And secondly, regarding the balance due increase, you'd think -- or maybe I should say, I would think that would be beneficial to Block and official to assisted probably detrimental to do-it-yourself and maybe certainly suggest that the economy is improving so we have that unknown fact. But going forward, what does more balance do suggest to you?\n\n---\n\nWell, it's an interesting question, Mike, does that -- with the interest here, Jason is coming -- would the balance do impact -- I can't see a reason why it would impact do-it-yourself versus assisted, but maybe I'm missing the point there because I think it's a matter of no matter how you filed, the balance due was higher this year for a variety of reasons. In terms of the specific cost, we're not going to break out specifically what it costs. Obviously you can see in our some of our numbers, we did increase marketing, we did increased training and we felt it was an important investment. We think it was a good investment but we're not going to break out anything specifically...\n\n---\n\nYes, I mean, I can break the cost in 3 buckets for you, and Bill mentioned a couple of them. The marketing cost per share, which includes merchandising, in-store merchandising, signs and things like that, that may be a season-to-season type of thing. It might not go up, it may not go down because we continue to be very bullish about ACA. The second bucket is really all the changes we had to make to our systems, programming changes that required a fair amount of hours and cost money. Those, for the most part, are one-time in nature. We're not going to have the same level this coming season and beyond. And then third is really the training. And there was, as you can imagine, a big blip upfront to get people up to speed on the law itself, the changes, but that's fairly durable now. So most of that will go away next year. We're not going to, as Bill said, quantify specifically, but these are not immaterial amounts of money that are not in the nonrecurring buckets.\n\n---\n\nGetting back to the balance due, I would expect that Block would generally do better than the retail firms. On the other hand, maybe the CPAs take market share. Do you have some thoughts regarding that?\n\n---\n\nJason, do you want to give your perspective on that?\n\n---\n\nWell, I think when we talk about complexity change, complexity is perceived. So if I have a balance due  change, and ultimately, I feel like because of that, I'm now more complex, then that's something that I think that getting back to your original question, Michael, I mean that's something that I can stand but -- or I can understand. But as far as how we approach the CPAs and the independents, I mean, not just on balance due but in every aspect, I mean, we think about this as how we create a superior experience, and that's something that we're certainly designing for as we look forward to next year and beyond.\n\n---\n\nI will say that we mentioned it briefly but I'll repeat it, the 50% off promotion was -- worked out really well from our perspective and it was probably somewhat because of the balance due clients, people saw that and felt that may be a good chance to come talk to us, and so we were sort of saw those intersection points quite clearly.\n\n---\n\nOkay. We'd like to thank everyone for joining us, and this will conclude today's call.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Scott Schneeberger (Analysts)】\nBill, following up on the bank, the -- realize, no update at this time. Just curious, though, are you in regular dialogue with the regulators? Have you -- has it been radio silent for a while? Or is there interaction back and forth?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nYes. Scott, I'm not going to comment on the specific work we're doing with the regulators. Suffice it to say that any questions they have, we answered timely and quickly. The discussions have been professional, courteous, thorough. And like I said, all along, on its merits, we believe the transaction will be approved.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Schneeberger (Analysts)】\nOkay. Curious, on ACA, I think in the press release you mentioned 15% of Block clients ACA affected. I think that's a little lower than what Block anticipated going into the season. I'm just curious, is that, in fact, accurate? And what drove that? What do you think was the dynamic affecting it, if so?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nYes. I'll have Mark comment in a second. I do want to say that while we did think that it was going to be upwards of 25% of our clients impacted, we have said repeatedly that this is going to unfold over a few years, that with all the consumer confusion and all of the -- really, the newness of taxes intersecting with health care that this was going to take a while to unfold. Now specifically, I'll let Mark speak to the difference between the 16% that actually occurred and the 25% we're anticipating.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Ciaramitaro (Executives)】\nYes. Scott, this is Mark. We came up with that figure out of 20% to 25% based upon kind of survey market research work. But what we found this past tax season is that more of our clients actually filed indicating coverage, nonmarketplace coverage for them and their household members. We think this is related to the fact that the IRS had really limited mechanisms in place, really, to enforce compliance. And a lot of people use the check box process as a way of avoiding ACA-related penalties.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Schneeberger (Analysts)】\nGreat. A couple more, if I may. The franchise, the acquisitions of franchisees and the company-owned stores, Greg, any quantification of impact of that and -- to the extent you can comment? And then following up on that, what is the strategy going forward with regard to M&A and perhaps buying any additional franchisees.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nYes. So we -- as we outlined back in the last quarter and then again, in December, we had a unique opportunity this year to buy back a number of our franchise locations that, at one point, were actually company-run territories. We think that the total population of those is somewhere in the 600 office range. This past season, we completed 341 store acquisitions. That was the old territory that we bought back. For the most part, we think that program is coming to the end of it, and we go back to our normal level of independent acquisitions, which were in every season, and while that ebbs and flows a little bit, we think it'll be in line with historical experience.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nAnd Scott, I think this is a healthy piece for a franchisor to our enable franchisees to have an exit strategy. In addition to some of the acquisitions we made, we are also working with some of our franchisees who are looking to buy other franchisees. So this is a pretty dynamic environment we think is going to ultimately lead a healthier system.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Schneeberger (Analysts)】\nOne final one, and I think I get it. Bill, you have a quote in the press release saying, \"Tax season challenging impacted by changes in the timing of tax filings.\" And I think Greg made -- may have answered it with regard to Canada. But I'm curious, should we read in any more to that? Is that what that comment was? Or were you alluding to something else?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nNo, I think that, that's consistent with what we were getting.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nYes. There's one subtly though, Scott, and it's actually one of those kind of important details that -- it's just an industry thing. But this season, there a lot more balance due clients than we had in the last several years. This is a situation where many Americas had an amount due to the IRS. And we know from many years ago, when that's true, they tend to wait later in the season to file. That's one of the reasons there was more of a back-end load this year. As an operational statement, that obviously would -- if we had known that better in advance, we would have better sort of a way we market it in terms of timing, our labor model and things like that. But in the grand scheme of things, it wasn't a huge issue, but it was one of the things that we spent a lot of time talking about.\n\n---\n\n【質問: George Tong (Analysts)】\nSo return volumes were impacted this year by EITC-related filings. Can you discuss what your expectations are for the behavioral shifts associated with the EITC filers and if you expect stabilization or this is a structural issue where volumes will need to be made up for elsewhere?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nWell, I think -- and Greg, if you want to add anything. There is -- there's a couple of components here. One is the shift of EITC filers from assisted to DIY that has occurred over the last 6 or 7 years, which we think is driven in large part by the disparity in documentation requirements between having to file with a paid preparer and having to file yourself. The other piece is the increase in fraud or improper payments, whatever term you want to use, that we have seen occurring with EITC filers, for this specifically. We continue to study this part of what I'm talking -- going to Washington so frequently for is to look at ways to -- this is not good for anybody to be having fraudulent returns filed and having improper payments taken from the U.S. Treasury. So I do think it is a combination of both of those issues, both of which can be solved with some common sense solutions.\r\nI don't know, Greg, if there's anything you want to add to that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nYes. Maybe I'll address the broader question you were asking as well, George. So an EIC form and the clients that use them, but the reality is this an area that has a traditional strength for H&R Block. We have a lot of experience with this type of client. We've got retail locations in a lot of the neighborhoods that bias that way. This is a complicated form that has very real consequences getting it wrong, and it is has very real consequences being it right as well. It has represented a very significant refund amount for those clients who are eligible. The fact that there is a problem here is not something -- in addition to the government strategy that Bill talked about, is not lost on Block. And we spending -- are spending a lot of time talking about other solutions, which, for competitive reasons, we're not going to get into right now. I will say that in December, we'll -- you'll probably hear more robust answer to this question.\n\n---\n\n【質問: George Tong (Analysts)】\nVery helpful. And drilling deeper into the ACA impact, assuming that 25% of your clients were impacted by the ACA this year, how much of an additional mix benefit do you estimate you would have seen on a percentage basis?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nYes, do you want to...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nYes. I mean, we're not going to -- I'm not going to hit into a sort of hypothetical numbers here for you. What we do know is that Block is in the best position in the tax industry to take our clients through this challenging time the next -- this year and the years to come here. The Block client themselves is twice likely to be impacted by the ACA. We don't think that, as a general idea, is going to change much. I think that many people, for the first time, begin to realize that their taxes and health care decisions are related, and we believe that Block is in the best position to take advantage of those.\r\nMark, do you have a comment?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Ciaramitaro (Executives)】\nYes. And I -- probably, George, it would be good to mention that next year, we believe that things are going to kind of -- the ante is going to be upped even more. We're going to have penalties increasing, but one of the big substantial changes next year is we expect IRS compliance to increase. And because really everyone who has received any kind of coverage is going to have to provide that verification to a 1095-A, -B or -C. So we do think the combination of increased enrollment, increased penalties and, really, this verification process is going to increase the number of filers impacted by ACA going forward.\n\n---\n\n【質問: George Tong (Analysts)】\nGot it. And you mentioned that about 2.4% mix impact is attributable to a combined combination of the EITC, the 1040EZ and the ACA. Is it possible to split out that 2.4% between those 3 components?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nSo we stated that roughly 2/3 of the loss is more on the EIC and the 1/3 at EZ. Now offsetting that, of course, was we had a very successful mid-season promotion, the 50% off promotion. That was really targeted between the first peak and the second peak, so we call that the trough in the industry. And that was a very successful program where we found that we were able to attract a lot of high-value clients for the first year with the understanding that a high number of those will be retained for year 2, 3 and beyond.\n\n---\n\n【質問: George Tong (Analysts)】\nGot it. And then lastly, digital is doing well in both sales and monetization. Can you discuss what product and marketing initiatives over the next 12 to 18 months you have in place to help drive the same share gains in digital?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nYes, George. We're not going to talk specifically about the future, but I will let Jason address, generally, the journey we've been on, which I think has been quite successful. He's done a remarkable job leading that business. So why don't you talk, in general terms, about what we've been trying to do?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jason Houseworth (Executives)】\nSure. And as you said, George, our goal every year is to outpace the industry in digital growth and improve our average revenue per user. And our results this year, plus 8% unit growth, plus 12% revenue growth, it really demonstrates the strong execution by our product team, delivering on what has been a multiyear product redesign. It has really started out as a journey just to make our product responsive, but what we've seen along the way is product innovation. And highlighted this year was our Refund Reveal feature. And I'm not going to give away a lot of where we're going, but I think that, that's really a great example of what I call intelligence to the service and what we're going to continue to see as features, which really help the user not only understand how they get the most refund back with H&R Block but also how the software really helps make the process a lot easier as they do their taxes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gil Luria (Analysts)】\nA couple of related questions. In your prepared remarks, you talked about the fact that the regulator hasn't approved -- or isn't -- doesn't seem to have any merits for not approving the bank sale. It sounds like you're maybe implying that there's other factors at hand here. And if that's the case, and even if it's not the case, and the regulator is going to say an unknown period of time to approve it, doesn't that make this the new normal? And if it is the new normal and given in consideration of other things that you talked about in terms of volumes and unit accounting, how do you generate earnings growth on a sustainable basis going forward without a bank sale? How -- unit's been assisted regardless of accounting decline. Is that sustainable for you to be able to generate earnings growth for a full-on period of time with declining units within assisted, especially where this year, you've seen it dragged down your Tax Plus product as well? And then on margins, you talked about a range. In the past, you're still at the high end of that range with less revenue growth and again, the inability of buying back shares, wouldn't you want to stretch that margin target upwards in order to generate sustainable earnings per share gains even without the ability to get rid of the bank?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nAll right. There is a lot there, Gil, so thank you for that. Let me take the beginning part and make sure that we're clear in terms of what we're saying on the bank update. And then Greg, I think if you want to take in, in general amount, pipe in if there's something you want to add. I don't think we wanted to indicate anything other than there's no information at this time. And while we're frustrated by the pace of the project, we don't see any reason why this wouldn't -- transaction would not be approved on its merits. Now -- so there's no signaling. There's no nothing on it, other than this seems to be taking long. That is from our perspective, and probably, many people would view it the same way. I'm not sure if the regulator does. And for those of you who deal with other banks and this whole industry, things are taking a long time in terms of any kind of deals that are being approved. I don't want to speak for the regulators, but I don't think they think this is -- I think they feel they're being thorough and complete as they approach this transaction. So while it's frustrating, while I would've thought we would've had an answer by now, there's nothing -- and hopefully, we've gotten this through, there's nothing that indicate that anything other than this will move forward. However, the timing is something that is still in the hands of the regulators. And I think from their perspective, and again, I can't speak for them, I don't think they're going to speak about this, I think the timing is consistent with some of the ways they look at other deals. Now as for what the implications of that are, and again, I think everyone of us -- also, I want to be very clear, we are very -- we are not going to change our minds, if you will. We do not want to be regulated as a savings and loan holding company any further. And we will -- we are -- our intention is to exit on our holding -- owning our own bank. So in terms of share counts and things like that, we'll get to that at the appropriate time. But our intent has never wavered on this with -- this is a particular transaction. We believe it will be approved, but that is not going to waver.\r\nNow as for the long-term growth, let me turn that over to Greg.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nYes. And the broader point that you're making, really, is about the investment pieces. And what I would say is that we continue to believe very strongly that our investment pieces remain true, specifically the growth levers that we've got, international growth, our digital growth. Our Tax Plus strategy, we believe is on our favorable tailwind in this business. We've had a good story on pricing. We've had a good story on mix. The unit count has been disappointing, but we're narrowing down the issue. And actually, if you sort of neutralize just this past season, for -- you guys have seen EZ, we actually grew, and that's exactly what we wanted to do. Importantly and something that we've about before is, that's why I got on this in my prepared remarks is that all units are not created equal. In fact, if you look at the lifetime value, there is a major discrepancy between a more -- sort of a more sophisticated tax return client and what one that has a more simple return. So as an example, our decision to get rid of EZ was the right decision then, and we continue to believe it was the right decision. We gave up a lot of units, but the overall client experience of those clients to the left are better. Now we're going to have a deeper relationship with them, and they're higher-value clients from a financial perspective. The EIC solution is one that we're working on. There's multiple solutions that we're talking about. We talked about a couple of them publicly. We've got a couple of other ideas there. That's one that we will be addressing more formally as we get into the next tax season. But overall, we believe very much that the investment pieces around the growth company remain solid here.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gil Luria (Analysts)】\nOkay. Let me just follow up on one aspect here. It's great to hear about your resolve about not wanting to be in the bank charter business is unchanged, is there not a possibility for you to unwind the bank without having to sell it, and therefore, not have to go through that, say, regulatory approval cycle? Is that not a possibility that you would have if this process was to keep going on or will this end with an unfavorable ruling?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nYes. So -- I mean, the important point, number one, is what Bill said, is we're going to get out of this business, right? That's just something we've committed to do. We will get it figured out. It's been frustrating, but we believe that the transaction we've been in into, both being talked about with all of you many times, is the way to go. As a hypothetical, in the event that doesn't work out, was sort of the next backup. There is a way to separate the going forward bank support that this company needs to continue to sell Tax Plus products, which we're very committed to, and the actual formalities involved of having a bank balance sheet. So effectively, we want to still be in the business of offering bank products, and we need a partner bank to do that. So think of that as one transaction. We do have a legacy bank. We've got deposits. We've got liabilities. Other liabilities, we've got assets that require a bank charter seating to find a home for those. So that would be -- have to be a second step of that transaction. And frankly, it's really the second part that's really the hang up in terms of getting that taken care of because whoever buys those will need to get approval from their regulator. Put clearly, if you keep it small and go to a much larger bank, it makes a little bit easier because these are all considerations that we've got. But really, just to finish up my kind of response to your question, the plan that we have with BofI is the right plan to [indiscernible] on the merits it will be approved.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thomas Allen (Analysts)】\nOn the bank sale, at the end of April, on earnings, BofI said that they believe their positive resolution would happen relatively soon. Do you share their kind of timing optimism at all?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nWell, I'm out of the forecasting business. I think what we shared and that we continue to work very closely with BofI. We're both -- we're committed to them. I think they're a terrific partner. We think the deal is going to be approved. But I -- as for timing, I -- we've been wrong a couple of times on this, that's why I'm out of the timing business.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nI mean, you have to keep in mind that -- I mean, we can be optimistic. They can be optimistic. But we're not the one who's making the decision here. It's up to our regulators. So I think it -- our position on this, it's just better not to comment. Greg and the BofI guys can do what they can -- what they want to do. But I don't think there's any difference of opinion, overall. It's really just how we want to represent the decision of the greater estimate.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thomas Allen (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then, Greg, as an answer to the last question, you talked about potentially winding down about -- or restructuring the transaction. As it stands, if I remember correctly, you estimated it'd be about -- the sale to BofI, the dilution would be about $0.07 to $0.09 a year. If you were to go down kind of plan B, any help on how to think about the ongoing dilution?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nOkay. I mean, just to be clear, I talked about it as a hypothetical. I didn't say there was any plans for restructuring by any means. And I guess the specific answer to your question is -- the best estimate I could give you is in line with what we currently understand, the $0.07 to $0.09. But it would clearly be a reflection of if there was feedback from a regulator. A different party may have a different viewpoint when they structure it differently. But I couldn't answer those questions specifically right now, so I'd say $0.07 to $0.09 is still the right number.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thomas Allen (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then just final question for me. So your survey work has suggested that 25% of your filers will be impacted by ACA, came in at 16%. You obviously invested some money both onetime and then ongoing in terms of ACA. Have you thought about -- at all, about rightsizing the investment? You're very good at kind of driving efficiency a few years ago. I'm just wondering if you think your shares [ph]are something similar now.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nYes. I think, Thomas, we're obviously looking to starting our planning for '16, and we'll take a look at that. But I do think the investment we made in training, in marketing that really established us certainly from the research we've gotten back as the people to turn in to when it comes to the -- this issue. I think our people were very well prepared, handled all of the simple and complex areas of this tax law change. I think our feedback on our marketing efforts was very strong. So it was an investment, I think, that we've established that. Therefore, do we have to spend that same level, probably not, but we're not prepared at this point to get into the specifics going forward. You'll obviously hear more about that in December.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nBut just to be clear, that is not a reflection. We continue to be very bullish about the ACA in our business. Reduction in investment is really just a reflection of the 1 year startup cost going away theoretically.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nYes. And I also think -- and also, I think all the feedback we've got, which I think shows that, that investment was worthwhile.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Anjaneya Singh (Analysts)】\nFirst off, I just wanted to touch on the decline attributable to their EZ clients. Do you have any sense as to how these clients may react next year? Do you foresee any sort of a carryover impact you saw this year into next? Or do you believe that we've worked through most of that decline?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nYes. So we think that most of the impact of the decision has been worked through the system at this point. So it's really going to be a -- mostly a nonissue for us last year. And just as a reminder, I mean, we ran this sort of free EZ promotion for several years. It had a life. We did a lot of financial assessment of the value of those clients, retention of those lines, propensity to buy new products. We believe that the program has run of life -- we terminate the products, of course, there was that 1 year benefit because they started charging for it again, but we lost a lot of units. There was a bit of an echo effect of this year. But to be clear, our research and our belief is that a lot of those clients who left us are extremely price-sensitive, and all they will do is continue to shop around. They're not loyal to any particular company, so any company that's sort of declaring victory over capturing a bunch of those units, I think, is a little bit misguided in what the real right value those clients are, unless they keep their prices at the low end.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Anjaneya Singh (Analysts)】\nOkay, got it. And sorry to belabor this point, but the 25% of your clients being impacted that you talked about at the Analyst Day versus the 16% you saw, do you still think the true number is 25%? Is -- was the result this year just impacted by really no control around documentation? Just wondering if you still believe the 25% figure is the accurate one or is it -- if it's closer to the 16%.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nI'll take the first part, and then Mark, you should -- you add your perspective. I do think it is. I think it's a combination of not only the documentation requirements that will enhance next year but also the sheer number of people who are going to be enrolled in the exchanges, coupled with, I think, a greater awareness that this is something that you have to comply with. But Go ahead, Mark.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Ciaramitaro (Executives)】\nYes. I think the Supreme Court ruling notwithstanding that, really, you -- if you look at the drivers of volume going forward, Bill already mentioned them. Compliance is a big factor. We think that, that obviously explained one of the big area of the shortfall this year. But just the doubling of enrollment and the continuing clients in enrollment, if you look at the CBO estimates, eventually climbing close to 20 million, will have a significant impact on the number of people impacted by ACA. So we absolutely believe, over the long run, that will be in that 20% to 25% range.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nYes. I think I will add. I think that if you go back to our statements, we did -- we have believed all along that we didn't -- sort of -- we kept hedging on the first year. We weren't sure where we were going to land. Okay, so now we have, if you will, a baseline. So we have felt all along that this would take a few years to really unfold, and we'll see if that's true. But we do believe it will be.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Anjaneya Singh (Analysts)】\nOkay. Got it. I'm not sure if I missed this, but another one on ACA. I realize there was a lot of confusion and delay in mailing out the forms from the IRS. But did the sort of profile of the clients that were ACA impacted, could you discuss how many of those were assisted versus DIY? Was there any shared shift from those clients that were H&R Block clients last year? Just hoping to better understand what the dynamics are between assisted and DIY as it relates to the ACA-impacted population.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nYes. What I would say, and then Mark, correct me if I don't augment this, there was -- the impact was about the same between both assisted and DIY. There was not much of a shift either way. I think, primarily, because as people walked in using their filing methods and many, many people, the high, high percentage in this industry, stay within their filing method, there is some degree of switching, but I think that contributed to that. So there was not a material shift, and the impact was about the same, whether you sought assistance or did it yourself.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Ciaramitaro (Executives)】\nYes. I think a slightly -- just slightly higher in the assisted side, Bill, because of the client mix there. But I agree, we did not see any significant evidence of shifting going forward. That doesn't mean that as complexity increases with more people having to go through the reconciliation process and really facing the refund impacts of that, that we aren't going to see the potential for some shifting going forward. What we have learned this year is that when people do see refund impact -- impacts and we do see delays in the issuing of forms and corrective forms, that does have the potential to alter both filing behavior, timing and method. But we didn't see substantial impacts this year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Anjaneya Singh (Analysts)】\nOkay, got it. And one final one for me. If you could just help us with what retention rates look like in DIY and assisted on -- in the latter, particularly, for the, let's say, the non-EZ filers and how that might have compared to your branded retail competitors?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nDo you want to take that or...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nYes. They were actually very pleased with our retention overall in the assisted side. They crept up. It wasn't quite a point but a little bit shy of that. So all things being equally, which included, by the way, the issues we've talked about, so that's actually a very good result.\r\nAnd then, Jason, you want to about DIY?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jason Houseworth (Executives)】\nYes, on the online side, although I still think we have a lot of room for growth, in online, we were up about 200 basis points; and in desktop software, we were up about 160 basis points.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jeffrey Silber (Analysts)】\nI apologize for going back to the bank with a couple of quick follow-up questions. If the deal does go through, can you just remind us what steps are needed and the time line for any potential capital return?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nHappy to. So upon receipt of regulatory approval, what would happen is at that point we would have, what I would call, mechanical close process with both the -- the steps themselves are really administrative in nature. We don't have, for example, financing contingencies or things like that. The amount of time, there's like client notices, there's like articles and corporation you have to exchange. There's some bid transfers you have to go through and just very mechanical things. That would be somewhere between 30 to 45 days. Our preference is typically to try to close the transaction at the end of a month. It just makes all the accounting easier. So that might just have to factor in. But the 30 to 45 days would take to close the transaction, and we would think effectively means not precisely but effectively, that at the same point, we would then no longer be deemed to savings and loan holding company. So call that concurrent as it were. And then at that point, we'd wash our hands. BofI would then be responsible for our tax products going forward that bank-related, and we'd look forward to a successful tax season with them really running the engine for us. That would be how the process works.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jeffrey Silber (Analysts)】\nAnd then again, after that, is there any issue in terms of timing for you with being able to return capital to shareholders?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nWell, I mean, there's always a consideration. We have a historical blackout period and things like that but these are things that we well understand. And our intent would be, of course, just given the time line that we've already gone through, to be fairly quick and expeditious in getting information back to the shareholder base about what our plans and thinking would be. So I'd say it's fairly much when we close is we get up and to start talking to people more publicly what our plans and thinking are.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jeffrey Silber (Analysts)】\nOkay, that's great. And then if the deal does not happen, any restrictions on the share repurchase and any increase in dividends? Are they still enforced?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nSo we are a savings and loan holding company at the parent company level and we're actually regulated by the Federal Reserve Bank. That's the parent company regulated -- the bank itself is regulated by the OCC. So we follow the parent company under all the capital requirements and things that bank holding companies typically are. We have been in a period now for 2 years effectively, where we've been building capital to meet those requirements. We don't believe there's any issues with the pace at which we're doing that, so that's one thing I just sort of set aside. Then of course, when the bank transaction completes, at that point we start with the $1 billion number we mentioned earlier and then any potential incremental debt we may want to raise, and of course, it also has impacted go-forward capital policy at that point.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jeffrey Silber (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then if I could just focus back on the core business, I know it's still too early to look at fiscal year 2016 and with the caveat you gave us regarding just looking at volume growth. But with that being said, is there any reason that we should not expect the industry volume growth to increase 1% to 2% next year as you thought might have occurred in 2015?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nJeff, I mean, that's a great question that obviously we're contemplating right now. We were surprised this year that the unit count was under 1%. So we're studying that. I'm not trying to kick the can down the road, but I guess I am to December. We'll look at that. You would not -- there is no obvious reason why it wouldn't -- it's been pretty consistent for 50-plus years, pretty much in line with nonfarm [ph] employment, but we've got to study what -- when we get the full information, which, frankly, from the IRS perspective we really don't get until the fall, then we can really understand why we're short this year. So more to come, but your supposition is not a bad one. But we were surprised this year with the growth in employment and everything that it didn't even to some extent go toward the higher end of that 1% to 2% range.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jeffrey Silber (Analysts)】\nOkay. Fair enough. And just a couple of quick modeling questions for fiscal year '16? What tax rate should we be using and what should we be modeling for both capital spending and any potential franchise or purchases?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nYes, I mean, we can certainly get into more detailed conversation offline. But in general, I would say that at this point, we've had great success in the tax rate this year with 34.5%, in line with last year. A lot of reasons for that were special one-offs type things and that we've had a couple good years there. So we're pretty happy with that. But what we said is the core based tax rate that the company continues to be at the 38% to 39% range. At some point in the near future, we'll give you a better indicator when we think that will be long term, but for now I keep it there. And then as we've said consistently we think the right CapEx level for this company is really between 3% and 4% of revenues. It's been a little higher than that or  trended toward the high end really as we made up a few years several years ago that were underspent, but we think we revert back to 3%, 4%. That's the best guidance I can give you.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jeffrey Silber (Analysts)】\nAll right. Great. And any potential franchise or purchases built in?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nNothing just like we've seen this year would be my position.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nBut we will continue on that path, as Greg said, in terms of we're in discussions right now. That usually occurs after the tax season. It takes a while. So we don't really have anything to report except we will probably proceed in that manner again but, as Greg said, not to the level that we did this past year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Millman (Analysts)】\nSo following up on a couple of things that have discussed, one, ACA, could you give us the cost that you incurred this year for ACA? And secondly, regarding the balance due increase, you'd think -- or maybe I should say, I would think that would be beneficial to Block and official to assisted probably detrimental to do-it-yourself and maybe certainly suggest that the economy is improving so we have that unknown fact. But going forward, what does more balance do suggest to you?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nWell, it's an interesting question, Mike, does that -- with the interest here, Jason is coming -- would the balance do impact -- I can't see a reason why it would impact do-it-yourself versus assisted, but maybe I'm missing the point there because I think it's a matter of no matter how you filed, the balance due was higher this year for a variety of reasons. In terms of the specific cost, we're not going to break out specifically what it costs. Obviously you can see in our some of our numbers, we did increase marketing, we did increased training and we felt it was an important investment. We think it was a good investment but we're not going to break out anything specifically...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nYes, I mean, I can break the cost in 3 buckets for you, and Bill mentioned a couple of them. The marketing cost per share, which includes merchandising, in-store merchandising, signs and things like that, that may be a season-to-season type of thing. It might not go up, it may not go down because we continue to be very bullish about ACA. The second bucket is really all the changes we had to make to our systems, programming changes that required a fair amount of hours and cost money. Those, for the most part, are one-time in nature. We're not going to have the same level this coming season and beyond. And then third is really the training. And there was, as you can imagine, a big blip upfront to get people up to speed on the law itself, the changes, but that's fairly durable now. So most of that will go away next year. We're not going to, as Bill said, quantify specifically, but these are not immaterial amounts of money that are not in the nonrecurring buckets.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Millman (Analysts)】\nGetting back to the balance due, I would expect that Block would generally do better than the retail firms. On the other hand, maybe the CPAs take market share. Do you have some thoughts regarding that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nJason, do you want to give your perspective on that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jason Houseworth (Executives)】\nWell, I think when we talk about complexity change, complexity is perceived. So if I have a balance due  change, and ultimately, I feel like because of that, I'm now more complex, then that's something that I think that getting back to your original question, Michael, I mean that's something that I can stand but -- or I can understand. But as far as how we approach the CPAs and the independents, I mean, not just on balance due but in every aspect, I mean, we think about this as how we create a superior experience, and that's something that we're certainly designing for as we look forward to next year and beyond.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nI will say that we mentioned it briefly but I'll repeat it, the 50% off promotion was -- worked out really well from our perspective and it was probably somewhat because of the balance due clients, people saw that and felt that may be a good chance to come talk to us, and so we were sort of saw those intersection points quite clearly.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Colby Brown (Executives)】\nOkay.

      "transcript_text1": "Thanks, Lavereal, and good morning, everyone. I appreciate your patience. We were trying to accommodate an unusually large group dialing in at the last moment for Brown-Forman's year-end 2015 earnings call. Joining me today are Paul Varga, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Jane Morreau, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Fitzgerald, Chief Accounting Officer.\r\nThis morning's conference call contains forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Numerous risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or projected in these statements. Many of the factors that will determine future results are beyond the company's ability to control or predict. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, and the company undertakes no obligation to update any of these statements whether due to new information, future events or otherwise. \r\nThis morning, we issued a press release containing our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. The release can be found on our website under the section titled Investor Relations. In the press release, we have listed a number of the risk factors that you should consider in conjunction with our forward-looking statements. Other significant risk factors are described in our Form 10-K, 8-K and Form 10-Q reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. \r\nDuring this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures and the reasons, management believes they provide useful information to investors regarding the company's financial conditions and results of operations are contained in the press release. \r\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Jane for her prepared remarks.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our year-end earnings call. I'll cover 3 topics today, which should leave plenty of time for questions after our prepared remarks. First, I'll review our fiscal 2015 results, including recent trends from the fourth quarter. Second, I'll discuss our earnings outlook for fiscal 2016. And finally, I'll update you on our capital investment plans. So with that, let me start by reviewing our fourth quarter. \r\nAs expected, we delivered strong results in the quarter with underlying net sales up 10%. This top line growth flowed nicely to the bottom line and resulted in 22% underlying operating income growth. As a reminder, the fourth quarter benefited from soft sales comparisons and unusually high SG&A in the prior year period. These fourth quarter underlying trends lifted our full year growth rates back into the ranges that we have shared with you since the start of the fiscal year. \r\nUnderlying net sales grew approximately 6.5% in fiscal 2015 with price/mix and volume contributing just under 3 and 4 points, respectively. Price/mix helped us deliver gross margin expansion of 60 basis points in the year and underlying operating income grew over 9% through operating expense leverage. We believe these are terrific growth rates against our public competitors who we estimate are only growing organic operating income a low single digit. \r\nLooking at our business by geography. Results in the U.S. accelerated nicely through fiscal 2015, resulting in 8% underlying net sales growth for the year. Fiscal 2015 marked the fourth consecutive year of volume share gains for Brown-Forman's portfolio in the United States. \r\nLooking at the most recent blended 3-month data for Nielsen and NABCA, Brown-Forman is growing value share at 8.2% versus TDS growth of 6.9%. We believe we are well positioned to keep driving value share gains over the coming years given the momentum in bourbon and American whiskey. \r\nIn fiscal 2015, our U.S. team worked closely with our partners to highlight the heritage and authenticity of our leading portfolio of American whiskey brands. We ended the year with depletions of just under 5 million cases for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey in the United States, an underlying net sales growth of 5%. The U.S. also drove Woodford Reserve's leadership of the superpremium bourbon category with 30% underlying net sales growth, roughly 10 points ahead of the categories growth, as well as accelerated Old Forester, we saw a 34% jump in underlying net sales. \r\nOn the innovation front, we continue to focus on creating long-term value through a disciplined approach, and we couldn't be more pleased with the enduring success of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey brand, growing underlying net sales at 10% as it begins its fifth year in the U.S. market. The brand has helped reinvigorate the entire trademark, bringing in new consumers and allowing Jack Daniel's to participate in new drinking occasions. \r\nWe expect our latest innovation, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire, to be equally adept at expanding our consumer base. After several quarters of testing, we began the nationwide rollout of Tennessee Fire in the U.S. during the fourth quarter and the trade and consumer reaction has been even better than what we experienced with Tennessee Honey. Preliminary takeaway data suggests that the brand is tracking above Honey's results at similar points in the brand's evolution. \r\nDespite its national rollout occurring late in the fiscal year, Tennessee Fire contributed almost 2 of the 8 points of growth in full year underlying net sales in the United States. Premiumization of the Jack Daniel's portfolio has been highly complementary to our flavor innovation, and between the 2, they are increasingly important contributors to our growth. \r\nFor example, in fiscal 2015, we've surpassed the 2 million case milestones globally for Tennessee Honey, Gentleman Jack and Single Barrel combined. These brand extensions of Jack Daniel's enjoyed favorable economics, in addition to fast rates of growth, and are meaningful drivers to the company. \r\nMoving now to non-U.S. markets. Developed markets outside the U.S. grew underlying net sales 4% in fiscal 2015. France, the United Kingdom and Canada continued to grow at a healthy clip. As a reminder, France's reported and underlying results benefited from comparisons with last year's route-to-market changes as we are no longer paying an agent to distribute our products there. \r\nExcluding this change, underlying net sales in France grew 17%. Total growth in developed markets outside of the U.S. was pulled down by 2% decline in Germany, driven by reduced trade promotional activity. Results were also sluggish in Australia, where weak consumer confidence and high spirits taxation is negatively impacting sales growth as well as Japan where a competitor is aggressively discounting its low-priced bourbon brand to drive volume growth. \r\nOur emerging market business grew 9% with great results in Turkey, Brazil, Ukraine, Indonesia and sub-Sahara Africa. Mexico grew underlying net sales 3%, but Poland declined 7%, largely due to the prior year tax increase and subsequent trade loading. Emerging markets, excluding Poland, grew underlying net sales by 14%, fueled by the Jack Daniel's family of brands that grew 19%. \r\nLet's now move to a reconciliation of reported to underlying results. An appreciating U.S. dollar weighed heavily on our reported results throughout fiscal 2015, so while our top line grew over 6% on an underlying basis for the year, foreign exchange negatively impacted our reported net sales by 3 percentage points. An increase in net trade inventories helped reported results by 1 part -- point, due in part to the pipeline fill associated with the U.S. launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire. \r\nNet of FX and inventory changes, reported net sales grew 4%. Underlying SG&A and A&P spend increased 4% in the year with lower rates of reported growth due to a stronger dollar. Our full year growth rate and underlying SG&A is more in line with the levels we are targeting in fiscal 2016 as we continue to focus on leveraging the investments we have been making over the last few years, including the recent route-to-market change in France. \r\nSo putting this all together, we delivered almost 9.5% growth in underlying operating income for the full year and earnings per share of $3.21, up 5%. Foreign exchange was a 7-point drag on reported EPS, including 3 points of transactional impact, 3 points of translational impact and 1 point driven by the higher-than-expected tax rate. \r\nMoving now to my second topic, our outlook for fiscal 2016. We are encouraged to see that the favorable trends that have been fueling our business over the last 4 years appear to be well entrenched and positioned to continue for the foreseeable future. These include strong global demand for authentic American whiskey, consumer interest in flavored whiskey and continued premiumization globally. \r\nIn fiscal 2016, we expect net sales growth of 6% to 7%. This range is consistent with the 6% rate we delivered in both fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015. While fiscal 2016 won't have the 0.5 point top line benefit from the France route-to-market change and we expect Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey to grow at a slower rate than this past year's 28% growth, 2016 does incorporate the anticipated incremental benefit from selling Tennessee Fire in the United States for a full year. And we also anticipate to begin testing the brand in a few markets outside the U.S. this year.\r\nLooking at our outlook by geography. We expect solid momentum in the United States, improving trends in Europe, soft results in Australia and a solid contribution from our rapidly growing emerging markets. In fiscal 2016, we anticipate driving both volume growth and improved price/mix. We have delivered 260 basis points of organic expansion over the past 3 years, but our gross margin should expand more modestly than this past year's 60 point -- basis point improvement, given expectations for higher contribution from volume in fiscal 2016. Gross profit growth should help drive underlying operating income growth of 8% to 10% as we expect operating expenses to grow at a slower rate themselves.\r\nMoving on to foreign exchange. The stronger dollar is forecast to negatively impact reported sales by approximately 3 to 4 points. But assuming current spot rates, we do not expect this dramatic $30 million foreign exchange loss in our other income and expense line that occurred in fiscal 2015 due to the revaluation of non-U.S. net current assets. The absence of this translational loss is expected to result in positive year-over-year variance that offset some of the negative transactional impacts that we are currently forecasting in fiscal 2016. We also anticipate that a reduction in inventory levels will negatively impact reported sales by another point as we comp against fiscal 2015's pipeline fill associated with Tennessee Fire's U.S. launch in the fourth quarter. This inventory reduction should be offset by a lower tax rate of 30% to 31%, and share repurchase should be accretive to the full year EPS based on past repurchases. \r\nIn total, we are anticipating diluted earnings per share of $3.40 to $3.60. For sensitivity on FX, a 10% move in the dollar in either direction would impact full year EPS by approximately $0.13. Just one quick comment on the phasing of fiscal 2016. The launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire in the fourth quarter of 2015 will create a challenging top line comparison in the fourth quarter of 2016. \r\nLet me now move on to the third and final topic, an update on our capital investment plan. Fiscal 2015 CapEx of approximately $120 million was a bit lighter than we expected, largely due to some delayed timing into fiscal 2016, but we continue to evaluate our long-term growth assumptions and the resulting opportunities to invest in meeting our future anticipated demand. This includes plans to invest roughly $200 million in CapEx during fiscal 2016. \r\nFor example, late yesterday, we announced our entry into the Irish whiskey category modeled off our success at Woodford Reserve. Irish whiskey is a small but fast-growing segment, and we believe the business shares many similarities to American whiskey. A total anticipated spend for the project over the next few years is $50 million, and this includes building a new distillery, constructing warehouses and creating a home place for Slane Castle Irish Whiskey at the historic Slane Castle site. \r\nAdditionally, our stepped-up capital spending includes the Old Forester urban distillery as well as plans for a major bottling expansion at Jack Daniel's and the purchase of a new stave mill in Indiana.\r\nTo share some perspective on the reasons to invest in our business, let's look at some of the anticipated 5-year growth rates from fiscal 2012 to fiscal 2016. Over this period, we expect to deliver underlying net sales growth of roughly 40% and underlying volume growth of around 30%.  This type of growth, combined with low market shares in the majority of the market around the world, reinforces our view that these investments in our organic growth are some of the highest return opportunities we possess to create value for our shareholders, and we should be aggressively investing behind them. We are halfway through this stepped-up investment to increase our total capacity, but still delivered an impressive return on invested capital of 22% in fiscal 2015. We expect capital spending to return to a more historic rate as we move past fiscal 2017. \r\nSo in summary, fiscal 2015 was another great year for Brown-Forman as we drove market-leading growth while simultaneously investing in our brands, our people and our assets. We are fortunate that our business model lends itself to visible and sustainable long-term growth. We generate tremendous free cash flow, which allows us to invest in our future and return $718 million of cash to our shareholders in fiscal 2015 through ongoing dividends and buyback programs. \r\nOver the last decade, we returned $4.3 billion to shareholders with nearly half of that occurring over the last 3 years. Other companies are capable of returning these levels of capital, but few do it at the same time that they are rapidly growing their top and bottom lines and investing in future growth at stepped-up rates. We believe that this balancing act featuring reinvesting in the business and returning capital to shareholders is one of the reasons we have generated a market-leading TSR over the last 10 years, well ahead of others in the industry and almost double the S&P 500. \r\nAs we look ahead, we remain focused on delivering top-tier returns for all of our stakeholders by continuing to execute on the strategy necessary to achieve our long-term growth ambitions, enabled by our family control and their commitment to thrive and endure for future generations. \r\nAnd so with that, let me turn the call over to Paul for his comments.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Jane, and good morning, everyone. Jane, I appreciate you taking the time to recap FY '15 and give a good detailed understanding of our forecast for FY '16. Yesterday, in preparation for this morning's call, I glanced back at my comments from the last several fiscal years and I noticed something interesting. Although I've emphasized various points in certain years or said things a bit differently each year, what was interesting was that the themes from each of these last many years were largely the same. As I read through them, some of the words and phrases that I found common were strong organic growth, high margins, led by the Jack Daniel's trademark, focused portfolio of premium spirit brands, successful and impactful innovation, balanced and diversified geographic results, consistent investment behind our brands and people, long-term view. I was really struck by how consistently I was using these same phrases over and over again. There were a few more worth mentioning as well: excellent capital deployment, favorable balance of risk and reward, industry-leading returns on invested capital, strong track record of financial performance and financial responsibility, top-tier total shareholder returns, outperformance relative to the competition, Brown family commitment, engagement and support, and of course, very importantly, diverse group of talented employees that make it all happen. \r\nSo when you put them all together, I think it makes for a very nice list of ingredients in Brown-Forman's recipe for success. It has been such a privilege to be able to discuss our company and its progress using phrases such as these. Know that all of us feel really fortunate. As you can tell from our release this morning and Jane's comments just a moment ago, these same many descriptors can be applied to our FY '15 performance. The largest exception in the last 12 months would be the impact of foreign exchange on our reported results and the drag we believe that has had on our shorter-term TSR. \r\nWhile it is beyond our capacity to precisely forecast future currency rates, when we study the U.S. dollar's historical value against an index of currencies, we observe that its current strength is notably beyond its historical trading range. Now foreign exchange fluctuations aside, it is also our plan for these descriptors to be the relevant themes for FY '16 and of course, we hope they remain relevant for many years to come. I want you to know, however, that we do not take any of them for granted. Inevitably, there are years that present more challenges than others and we have had brands or countries which have struggled. We try to pay close attention to competitive forces and trends that might limit our ability to describe Brown-Forman in this way. I sometimes refer to this as the company's healthy paranoia in evaluating risks and threats. \r\nAs a result, in the face of economic or competitive pressures, we strive to adjust, to innovate, to be adaptive without overreacting, to be balanced, to persist so that these enviable descriptors I've shared with you this morning will still apply when we discuss Brown-Forman's progress in the future.\r\nNow before we take your questions, I thought I would touch just briefly on the news we announced yesterday about our intent to enter the premium Irish whiskey category through a blend of acquisition, innovation, partnership and investment. We believe that the premium-plus Irish whiskey segment has many of the attractive characteristics we've long admired and benefited from in premium American whiskeys and bourbons. These characteristics include: excellent category and segment momentum, high gross margins with the ability to further premiumize, attractive returns on capital once sufficient scale has been achieved, shorter aging horizons relative to some categories, strong heritage and history but with a contemporary flair, the ability to innovate within the same trademark, great usage versatility ranging from straight to mixed, and very importantly, still at very early stages of global development. \r\nSomething we find attractive about the category that is in contrast to the American and Scotch whiskey categories is that there are simply fewer competitors in Irish whiskey today. While I expect this to change over time, this is a uniquely attractive attribute of Irish whiskey at the present time. Given the very limited number of Irish brands and distilleries in existence, along with the fact that few have any interest in selling, we've chosen to take this unique approach to acquire our company's long-term view and over time, try to build something similar to what we've done with Woodford Reserve over the last 20 years or so. Needless to say, it's a very exciting opportunity for Brown-Forman. \r\nWhen you consider this alongside our significant capital investments behind our production operations and consider the enthusiasm we have for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire and Tennessee Honey and consider that we believe the prevailing descriptors of Brown-Forman will remain relevant and further consider that we've stepped up our share repurchase program recently, it brings into focus our belief that the best investment Brown-Forman can make at this time is in Brown-Forman. We will, of course, keep you updated on our progress as it unfolds. \r\nThat concludes our remarks for the morning, and thank you for listing. So we're now happy to take any of your questions.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Jason Koval (Executives)】\nThanks, Lavereal, and good morning, everyone. I appreciate your patience. We were trying to accommodate an unusually large group dialing in at the last moment for Brown-Forman's year-end 2015 earnings call. Joining me today are Paul Varga, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Jane Morreau, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Fitzgerald, Chief Accounting Officer.\r\nThis morning's conference call contains forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Numerous risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or projected in these statements. Many of the factors that will determine future results are beyond the company's ability to control or predict. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, and the company undertakes no obligation to update any of these statements whether due to new information, future events or otherwise. \r\nThis morning, we issued a press release containing our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. The release can be found on our website under the section titled Investor Relations. In the press release, we have listed a number of the risk factors that you should consider in conjunction with our forward-looking statements. Other significant risk factors are described in our Form 10-K, 8-K and Form 10-Q reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. \r\nDuring this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures and the reasons, management believes they provide useful information to investors regarding the company's financial conditions and results of operations are contained in the press release. \r\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Jane for her prepared remarks.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nThanks, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our year-end earnings call. I'll cover 3 topics today, which should leave plenty of time for questions after our prepared remarks. First, I'll review our fiscal 2015 results, including recent trends from the fourth quarter. Second, I'll discuss our earnings outlook for fiscal 2016. And finally, I'll update you on our capital investment plans. So with that, let me start by reviewing our fourth quarter. \r\nAs expected, we delivered strong results in the quarter with underlying net sales up 10%. This top line growth flowed nicely to the bottom line and resulted in 22% underlying operating income growth. As a reminder, the fourth quarter benefited from soft sales comparisons and unusually high SG&A in the prior year period. These fourth quarter underlying trends lifted our full year growth rates back into the ranges that we have shared with you since the start of the fiscal year. \r\nUnderlying net sales grew approximately 6.5% in fiscal 2015 with price/mix and volume contributing just under 3 and 4 points, respectively. Price/mix helped us deliver gross margin expansion of 60 basis points in the year and underlying operating income grew over 9% through operating expense leverage. We believe these are terrific growth rates against our public competitors who we estimate are only growing organic operating income a low single digit. \r\nLooking at our business by geography. Results in the U.S. accelerated nicely through fiscal 2015, resulting in 8% underlying net sales growth for the year. Fiscal 2015 marked the fourth consecutive year of volume share gains for Brown-Forman's portfolio in the United States. \r\nLooking at the most recent blended 3-month data for Nielsen and NABCA, Brown-Forman is growing value share at 8.2% versus TDS growth of 6.9%. We believe we are well positioned to keep driving value share gains over the coming years given the momentum in bourbon and American whiskey. \r\nIn fiscal 2015, our U.S. team worked closely with our partners to highlight the heritage and authenticity of our leading portfolio of American whiskey brands. We ended the year with depletions of just under 5 million cases for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey in the United States, an underlying net sales growth of 5%. The U.S. also drove Woodford Reserve's leadership of the superpremium bourbon category with 30% underlying net sales growth, roughly 10 points ahead of the categories growth, as well as accelerated Old Forester, we saw a 34% jump in underlying net sales. \r\nOn the innovation front, we continue to focus on creating long-term value through a disciplined approach, and we couldn't be more pleased with the enduring success of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey brand, growing underlying net sales at 10% as it begins its fifth year in the U.S. market. The brand has helped reinvigorate the entire trademark, bringing in new consumers and allowing Jack Daniel's to participate in new drinking occasions. \r\nWe expect our latest innovation, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire, to be equally adept at expanding our consumer base. After several quarters of testing, we began the nationwide rollout of Tennessee Fire in the U.S. during the fourth quarter and the trade and consumer reaction has been even better than what we experienced with Tennessee Honey. Preliminary takeaway data suggests that the brand is tracking above Honey's results at similar points in the brand's evolution. \r\nDespite its national rollout occurring late in the fiscal year, Tennessee Fire contributed almost 2 of the 8 points of growth in full year underlying net sales in the United States. Premiumization of the Jack Daniel's portfolio has been highly complementary to our flavor innovation, and between the 2, they are increasingly important contributors to our growth. \r\nFor example, in fiscal 2015, we've surpassed the 2 million case milestones globally for Tennessee Honey, Gentleman Jack and Single Barrel combined. These brand extensions of Jack Daniel's enjoyed favorable economics, in addition to fast rates of growth, and are meaningful drivers to the company. \r\nMoving now to non-U.S. markets. Developed markets outside the U.S. grew underlying net sales 4% in fiscal 2015. France, the United Kingdom and Canada continued to grow at a healthy clip. As a reminder, France's reported and underlying results benefited from comparisons with last year's route-to-market changes as we are no longer paying an agent to distribute our products there. \r\nExcluding this change, underlying net sales in France grew 17%. Total growth in developed markets outside of the U.S. was pulled down by 2% decline in Germany, driven by reduced trade promotional activity. Results were also sluggish in Australia, where weak consumer confidence and high spirits taxation is negatively impacting sales growth as well as Japan where a competitor is aggressively discounting its low-priced bourbon brand to drive volume growth. \r\nOur emerging market business grew 9% with great results in Turkey, Brazil, Ukraine, Indonesia and sub-Sahara Africa. Mexico grew underlying net sales 3%, but Poland declined 7%, largely due to the prior year tax increase and subsequent trade loading. Emerging markets, excluding Poland, grew underlying net sales by 14%, fueled by the Jack Daniel's family of brands that grew 19%. \r\nLet's now move to a reconciliation of reported to underlying results. An appreciating U.S. dollar weighed heavily on our reported results throughout fiscal 2015, so while our top line grew over 6% on an underlying basis for the year, foreign exchange negatively impacted our reported net sales by 3 percentage points. An increase in net trade inventories helped reported results by 1 part -- point, due in part to the pipeline fill associated with the U.S. launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire. \r\nNet of FX and inventory changes, reported net sales grew 4%. Underlying SG&A and A&P spend increased 4% in the year with lower rates of reported growth due to a stronger dollar. Our full year growth rate and underlying SG&A is more in line with the levels we are targeting in fiscal 2016 as we continue to focus on leveraging the investments we have been making over the last few years, including the recent route-to-market change in France. \r\nSo putting this all together, we delivered almost 9.5% growth in underlying operating income for the full year and earnings per share of $3.21, up 5%. Foreign exchange was a 7-point drag on reported EPS, including 3 points of transactional impact, 3 points of translational impact and 1 point driven by the higher-than-expected tax rate. \r\nMoving now to my second topic, our outlook for fiscal 2016. We are encouraged to see that the favorable trends that have been fueling our business over the last 4 years appear to be well entrenched and positioned to continue for the foreseeable future. These include strong global demand for authentic American whiskey, consumer interest in flavored whiskey and continued premiumization globally. \r\nIn fiscal 2016, we expect net sales growth of 6% to 7%. This range is consistent with the 6% rate we delivered in both fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015. While fiscal 2016 won't have the 0.5 point top line benefit from the France route-to-market change and we expect Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey to grow at a slower rate than this past year's 28% growth, 2016 does incorporate the anticipated incremental benefit from selling Tennessee Fire in the United States for a full year. And we also anticipate to begin testing the brand in a few markets outside the U.S. this year.\r\nLooking at our outlook by geography. We expect solid momentum in the United States, improving trends in Europe, soft results in Australia and a solid contribution from our rapidly growing emerging markets. In fiscal 2016, we anticipate driving both volume growth and improved price/mix. We have delivered 260 basis points of organic expansion over the past 3 years, but our gross margin should expand more modestly than this past year's 60 point -- basis point improvement, given expectations for higher contribution from volume in fiscal 2016. Gross profit growth should help drive underlying operating income growth of 8% to 10% as we expect operating expenses to grow at a slower rate themselves.\r\nMoving on to foreign exchange. The stronger dollar is forecast to negatively impact reported sales by approximately 3 to 4 points. But assuming current spot rates, we do not expect this dramatic $30 million foreign exchange loss in our other income and expense line that occurred in fiscal 2015 due to the revaluation of non-U.S. net current assets. The absence of this translational loss is expected to result in positive year-over-year variance that offset some of the negative transactional impacts that we are currently forecasting in fiscal 2016. We also anticipate that a reduction in inventory levels will negatively impact reported sales by another point as we comp against fiscal 2015's pipeline fill associated with Tennessee Fire's U.S. launch in the fourth quarter. This inventory reduction should be offset by a lower tax rate of 30% to 31%, and share repurchase should be accretive to the full year EPS based on past repurchases. \r\nIn total, we are anticipating diluted earnings per share of $3.40 to $3.60. For sensitivity on FX, a 10% move in the dollar in either direction would impact full year EPS by approximately $0.13. Just one quick comment on the phasing of fiscal 2016. The launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire in the fourth quarter of 2015 will create a challenging top line comparison in the fourth quarter of 2016. \r\nLet me now move on to the third and final topic, an update on our capital investment plan. Fiscal 2015 CapEx of approximately $120 million was a bit lighter than we expected, largely due to some delayed timing into fiscal 2016, but we continue to evaluate our long-term growth assumptions and the resulting opportunities to invest in meeting our future anticipated demand. This includes plans to invest roughly $200 million in CapEx during fiscal 2016. \r\nFor example, late yesterday, we announced our entry into the Irish whiskey category modeled off our success at Woodford Reserve. Irish whiskey is a small but fast-growing segment, and we believe the business shares many similarities to American whiskey. A total anticipated spend for the project over the next few years is $50 million, and this includes building a new distillery, constructing warehouses and creating a home place for Slane Castle Irish Whiskey at the historic Slane Castle site. \r\nAdditionally, our stepped-up capital spending includes the Old Forester urban distillery as well as plans for a major bottling expansion at Jack Daniel's and the purchase of a new stave mill in Indiana.\r\nTo share some perspective on the reasons to invest in our business, let's look at some of the anticipated 5-year growth rates from fiscal 2012 to fiscal 2016. Over this period, we expect to deliver underlying net sales growth of roughly 40% and underlying volume growth of around 30%.  This type of growth, combined with low market shares in the majority of the market around the world, reinforces our view that these investments in our organic growth are some of the highest return opportunities we possess to create value for our shareholders, and we should be aggressively investing behind them. We are halfway through this stepped-up investment to increase our total capacity, but still delivered an impressive return on invested capital of 22% in fiscal 2015. We expect capital spending to return to a more historic rate as we move past fiscal 2017. \r\nSo in summary, fiscal 2015 was another great year for Brown-Forman as we drove market-leading growth while simultaneously investing in our brands, our people and our assets.

Needless to say, it's a very exciting opportunity for Brown-Forman. \r\nWhen you consider this alongside our significant capital investments behind our production operations and consider the enthusiasm we have for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire and Tennessee Honey and consider that we believe the prevailing descriptors of Brown-Forman will remain relevant and further consider that we've stepped up our share repurchase program recently, it brings into focus our belief that the best investment Brown-Forman can make at this time is in Brown-Forman. We will, of course, keep you updated on our progress as it unfolds. \r\nThat concludes our remarks for the morning, and thank you for listing. So we're now happy to take any of your questions.",
      "transcript_text3": "My first question has to do with the outlook, please, for price/mix and if you could unpack that a little bit, price versus mix and how that might vary, U.S. versus international.\n\n---\n\nOkay, I can take that. So we talked about the top line. We forecasted the growth in the 6% to 7% range, and we're forecasting that this next year, we have a bit more volume than we had this past year. So volume will be a bigger contributor to our top line growth than it has been this year. But we do continue to expect price to deliver and mix to deliver in the low single digits, a couple percentage points. But I will say what we're doing as it relates to pricing, we'll take a nominal pricing, if you will, in the U.S. and many markets around the world. But in some markets, we are being very focused on pricing. So for instance, I'll focus on el Jimador, which is our largest full-strength tequila. In the Mexico market itself, in our second year of pretty major pricing activity, so in the second year, we're repositioning the brand to be more premium and really kind of improve that brand business, if you will. And we think over the long term, it'll improve the equity of the brand, the growth of the brand, and most importantly, the returns on that brand. And so that's a place where we're focusing heavily on taking pricing. The markets where the FX hurt the results and where we see competitors also taking pricing such as Brazil and Russia, we're also taking pricing in those markets. And so we're obviously very -- looking around and being very aware of what's going on in the marketplace and where the economics support pricing and will take further if things happen to improve in certain markets. But that's kind of the way we're looking at volume and price/mix this next year. I hope that helps.\n\n---\n\nYes, I might add one thing on this. I think it's helpful if you think about the pricing over a multiyear. I mean, if you go back a few years, we have been a little more aggressive, and I would say this year, we're leaning a little bit more on volume than pricing and the total mix and some of that is because we look ahead as well. If you think about the consumer trends and their volumetric interest, particularly for the premium brands where we're already very well positioned, this is a great year for us to get volume, I think. And in future years, because of the capital investments we've been making over these last many years, we'll start to see some of the costs associated with those commemorative [ph]. I think there'll be more responsibility on our part to try to cover some of that with pricing. So if you think about it over like I -- which we try to do over 3- or 5- or 7-year period, the balance of pricing and mix, this is a particularly good year, we think. And I think our people feel that way, too, when we did our planning, that this is a good volumetric year and so we lean a little bit more toward that. And we still get a lot of benefit from the mix, we think.\n\n---\n\nYes, that's a good point, Paul. Just building on Paul's point on mix. You heard us talk about some of our brands -- Jack Daniel brands exceeding 2 million cases this year, our premium end, the Gentleman Jack, the Single Barrel and actually, the Honey brands, and those are our higher-priced brands, if you will. Those, coupled with if you get Woodford Reserve growing over 30%, those are higher priced and that mix alone, as they continue to grow, will help offset the mix.\n\n---\n\nYes, they may become effective price increases on the whiskey.\n\n---\n\nAbsolutely, that's terrific. My second question has to do with your outlook for advertising spending please.\n\n---\n\nYes. So I don't have specific -- I think what we've said, what we're looking to do next year is get, from our operating expenses, some leverage between operating expenses. Most likely it'll come in the form of SG&A. SG&A is the biggest of our 2 components, so we're going to continue to invest behind our people and we will continue to invest behind our brands. I think what you -- what I'd like to do is look, somewhat to what Paul said about pricing, is to look at what we've invested over the last 5 years, particularly as it relates to SG&A. And I think our stepped-up investment, whether it was in route-to-consumers in France or Turkey and Brazil and other places, we've invested quite a bit and we want you to think this is a good year ahead to start leveraging that. As it relates to A&P, we'll continue to invest behind our brands and the markets where we think that the consumers are willing to listen and where we can listen. I think one other point to -- important point to make here is on dark markets. More and more markets are becoming dark and so I think that we need -- we all need to be aware that people are the ones building the brands in those markets, so in those markets, you may see SG&A increase. So we kind of look at the things coming together. You got to have people to grow the brands and they've got to be there to support the A&P spends too.\n\n---\n\nI think within the mix too, Vivian, you would -- as you would imagine, there's quite a bit of -- not quite a bit, but reallocation has been going on within our mix of A&P investment. So like for example in the first half of this year, you would expect us to be spending more money on Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire as it launches and we go out and support its initial reception in the marketplace. Our American whiskeys increasingly have been receiving more A&P because the trends are so favorable to them, and it might be coming like I note, like for example, last year, it came a little bit of the expenses and media budget for Southern Comfort, which had not been traveling as well its trend. So there's been some reallocations within the mix as well. But we think, because of the past investments and the level we're going to have of investing behind it now, I think we're pretty comfortable that we should still get nice leverage.\n\n---\n\nWanted to follow up a little bit on some of the comments about the SG&A leverage on investment. And I guess, what I'm trying to figure out is, you improved the profitability per case by sort of bringing this stuff in-house, but there also was, I guess, a level of investment in terms of building that capability. So as we look at you cycling those, is it 2 benefits as we look out to fiscal year '16 in terms of the additional profit plus the lower spending? Or is it just sort of one benefit from that standpoint?\n\n---\n\nYou might -- can I just ask you to clarify that? Which benefits are you talking about? I maybe missed the first part. Are you talking about the absence or presence of the French investment? I was trying to read into your...\n\n---\n\nYes. Well, I guess, what I would say is, right, my understanding is the investments in France create a business that is structurally a higher profit per case business. And then along with that, you have additional -- were there additional investments? So as we look at the leverage, are there 2 things driving the SG&A leverage as opposed to just 1, if that makes sense?\n\n---\n\nLet me -- I'll take the first part of your question. The benefit from France happened in F '15 in terms of our net sales benefit that we're approaching. You're not going to have another benefit in F '16 as it relates to that. So if that happens -- but just to step back for a moment when we change these route-to-consumers is really what happened is someone else was representing us in the market and we were paying them a margin, so our sales were lower at the time. Now we brought it in-house, our sales are higher, and we brought the capabilities in-house and so that SG&A, which started when we geared up this route-to-consumer about a year ago, January, so we had 9 months of it in this fiscal year roughly that won't repeat itself again next year. So you will get a benefit from that next year, but we won't have that year-over-year increase, if you will.\n\n---\n\nYes. So the -- it's now in the base and there will be less benefit to the sales line of incorporating it and less hurt to the SG&A line, of hurting it in F '16.\n\n---\n\nYes. There's no more hurt coming through, it's in the base.\n\n---\n\nIt's just in the base.\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nWe somehow lost her.\n\n---\n\nIt's Eric Serotta in for Robert. Couple of questions with respect to flavors. First, on previous calls, you talked about Fire indexing at about 130% to 140% relative to Honey at similar stage of its development. I know you mentioned in this call it's also tracking favorably. Wondering if you could put some quantification around that. And second, hoping you could -- you, Paul, could talk a bit about flavors more broadly. Diageo is having a lot of success recently with Crown Royal Regal Apple. Wondering how you're thinking about whether a year-round apple variant for Jack is needed or next. Any context will be greatly appreciated.\n\n---\n\nLet me take the first part and you take the second part?\n\n---\n\nSure, it's fine.\n\n---\n\nOkay. So yes, as we talked about, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire just got launched in our fourth quarter nationally. And we know there continues to be an enormous amount of interest in flavor, as you noted, in the U.S., and firstly, it was Honey just completing its fourth year and having the type of growth it had this year in the U.S. of 10%. So as we look at our read on Fire, what we had communicated last quarter, we have really just focused on our 3 test markets and we've now since had 5 other markets that we had expanded to in October. So we got a little bit more read and we feel very good about what we're seeing. It still is in the 130% range as it relates to how it's relating to the same period of time for the Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey launch. And so we know cinnamon is a hot category and we have -- we're very cautiously optimistic about the Tennessee Fire and what it could do for us the next fiscal year. And I'll turn it over to Paul to talk about flavors in general.\n\n---\n\nYes. I mean, just building on what Jane said there, I think that, as a general comment, I think we're going to continue to pace ourselves correctly even with Tennessee Fire, which, in my view, sort of had a 3-stage introduction to the U.S. market. We even there want to continue to evaluate its performance in the marketplace. As you can imagine, with any Jack Daniel's product line extension in these cases, there's always an initial interest in it. I mean, it's just such a big and powerful brand and people give it the benefit of trial oftentimes. And so in the test markets for Tennessee Fire, we wanted to make sure that, that was repeatable, that people actually would get through any barriers that might have been perceived. The biggest one oftentimes for products that are labeled flavored is whether the product in the bottle is working in. Every indication we've had so far on Tennessee Fire is that it, in fact, is. So when you move beyond that for us, I mean, it's always to consider Jack Daniel's tends to enter very premium price points and that's again the case here in the cinnamon world. So you're trying to test what level of consumer interest and affordability shakes out, so that's something we continue to watch. And with the national scale launch now, as the months unfold, we'll have more and more data to look at to see how that particular aspect plays out. As it relates to the increasing competition and even you referenced one of them, there are no plans on our part right now other than really implementing the Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire and Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey plans that we have in place for FY '16. In general, you should expect us to continue to be cautious. The Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey sort of global rollout took 4 years, and I think with Tennessee Fire, beyond the things I've already mentioned related to what we'll evaluate there, Jane did mention these limited tests in a few of the international markets. We're going to want to look at those and read those. There's a lot of work still to be done and to be interpreted and evaluated before we consider anything beyond what we've done just now. But we will of course try to study the competitive landscape related to any flavor that's out there, so we can understand how it may impact the flavor entries we've got. So that's how we feel about it right now.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And just one housekeeping question, Jane. I think you gave specific guidance in terms of FX impact on net sales for fiscal '16. I know you said that the EPS impact or the earnings impact wouldn't have that headwind of the $30 million in translation, balance sheet translation. Did you give specific EPS guidance as to what the year-on-year headwind would be for FX?\n\n---\n\nI did not, but you can expect it to be several cents.\n\n---\n\nPaul, with respect to the list of superlatives that you rattled off, and I mean this truly is probably the best company I've ever followed in 30 years of doing research, I did note 2 things that we frequently talked about on calls that were not talked about today, SoCo and RTD. And I just wondered if you'd offer up any thoughts about sort of reigniting -- or stabilizing, reigniting growth, whatever it might be in those 2.\n\n---\n\nYes. I mean, well, thank you for the comment, number one, and welcome to the call. I'm going to have you read it next time. No, honestly, the Southern Comfort one, we have talked about with regularity about the challenges in part of -- this is a very interesting dilemma for Brown-Forman, if you go back 5 or 6 years ago, that Southern Comfort was one of the key targets of all this competitive flavor success that other companies were having. And to be quite honest, our entry into flavored whiskey was a bit defensive. It was to protect Jack Daniel's and Southern Comfort and our company in some ways, and Honey emerged mostly to be, I mean, really to be fair, out of that. And then -- but I think our company and the people who launched it did a superb job of making it work in the marketplace in the way that it has. So Southern Comfort along the way, we've been -- we have been actually -- I feel like shoring it up. I really do feel like it would've been competitively deteriorating more had we not been taking some of the steps we've taken. And as I look at that growth rates going back 7 years ago, 5 years ago, 3 years ago, some of them have moderated. And some of that's come through what I'll call innovation underneath the Southern Comfort umbrella, and some of it has just been that there really is a core Southern Comfort user who likes the product in the bottle and is not going to be distracted by some of the flavor entries. And so we feel like we've done some of the best work we can do there with, particularly with advertising and communications. We felt like we've put forward a good step there. It's just competitively under assault. So I will say that from a corporate portfolio standpoint, when you add up the Southern Comfort volumes with the Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey volumes and what we hope will be a successful Tennessee Fire volumes, in the aggregate, they add up to nice growth for Brown-Forman's flavored portfolio, as you can imagine. On the RTDs, you make a point. I don't know if we mentioned it. We certainly mentioned it throughout the course of the year, but a lot of that is related to the difficulties of the Australia market and how competitive it's become, the difficulty really at the macroeconomic level for Australia right now, but also very much the competitive nature of RTDs down there. There's been some impact from competition. Southern [ph] has done very well down there, so it's taken some of the steam out of what has been a very nice progress over more than a decade for Brown-Forman largely under the Jack Daniel's name of RTDs. And we're not done with innovation there. We think there's still a lot of opportunity there, particularly when you consider that against the denominator of all single-serve beverage alcohol, which brings in the category of beer. So we don't quite have news to share on that today, but just trust that there will be a lot of work going on to make sure our RTD business remains healthy.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And just one follow-up for Jane, if I could. The discussion of the fourth quarter tax rate, obviously, the quarter would have been much better if you'd had a more normal rate. And also, Old Forester, up 30-some percent or...\n\n---\n\nYes, there you go.\n\n---\n\nCan you elaborate on -- I mean, it sounded like you made comments, I think, in the release that suggest that it was getting more on-premise feature, is that correct?\n\n---\n\nYes, I'll comment on Old Forester, let Jane tackle the tax one. But yes, the Old Forester, there's this irony since you've known us for so long. The brand, in some ways, became so small that it became cool and relevant again because that was our founding brand and it had been sort of chugging along at the 100,000 case mark for a bunch of years. And of course, everybody at Brown-Forman is very passionate about it because of what it represents to the corporation and to the family. But it has met its time is the way I'd say it. It is an exceptional value in the marketplace for the quality of bourbon that's in the bottle and the price the consumer pays. And I think that recognition has come about. There's certainly some retro appeal to it. And I would give a lot of credit to the teams that have worked on Old Forester because the expressions of Old Forester Birthday Bourbon that has been out there now for many, many years have reminded people of the quality. And I was struck just within a very short amount of time this spring, we -- I observed -- somebody sent me a copy of people standing in line to get the latest release of Old Forester Birthday Bourbon, right around the time that we announced that Old Forester would be flavored and be the mint julep of the Kentucky Derby. So there it was, working both dimensions of the appeal of American whiskey both premiumizing, but also adding flavor. And so I'd say Old Forester is at the sweet spot of opportunity for American whiskey at Brown-Forman and that's why we're investing in the way we are down the historic whiskey road behind the new distillery.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And Tim, just to follow up on your question as it relates to the tax rate. It did come in a couple of points higher than what we had anticipated too. And the point of it was due really to a higher mix of our U.S. business, if you will, which, unfortunately, is taxed at a higher rate than we had anticipated if we had, had more earnings outside the U.S. So said another way, our earnings outside the U.S. were a little bit smaller than we had expected. That's about a point. The second point is what I would call more discrete in nature, more onetime in nature and it relates to foreign exchange transactions. And again, we wouldn't expect that to continue next year, assuming the rates stay where they are. So just as a reminder, I gave the forecast of a 30%, 31% for '16 is what we're assuming right now.\n\n---\n\nJust a couple quick questions. One, can you give a little more color on el Jimador and kind of what was alluded to in kind of the change of the pricing in Mexico and how that's expecting to kind of play out over the next few months or few quarters, I guess?\n\n---\n\nYes. We can maybe -- I'll start it and Jane, you can add to it. Yes, I mean, I think part of it, Bill, we -- our company is not largely in the, what I'll call, the big local market categories. And the lone exceptions that actually we probably would have referenced over the last fiscal year would be the very sizable, at the popular price point, el Jimador business in Mexico. And then, the closest thing to that might be the Finlandia business, even though it's premium in that market, to the -- in the Polish market. And worldwide, a lot of those segments are -- have been under pressure for a while. And so we're not exposed to them too much and I think it's actually one of the reasons we have such nice competitive outperformance. But where we do have them, we try to improve them, is the way I'd say it. And our teams in Poland and Mexico have been busy working on corrective actions. In the case of el Jimador down in Mexico, I mean, it has our attention because we just think it's not that great a business for Brown-Forman at that price point. And so you get extra motivated to make sure the economics of the business improve, not only trying to get the thing to grow, but also the economics of it improve. And that one is unique because it's a, at that price point, it's a 100% agave product, which means it has a pretty significant amount of raw material commitment behind it for multi-years. And the way I see it, just sometimes the math doesn't work for that unless you go fix it. And so part of it is like the Herradura business, at a very super-premium price point, works pretty well the math for Brown-Forman. But lower price points doesn't work as well. Even the el Jimador business in the United States works reasonably well and because it's at a much more attractive price point than the Mexico price point. Now we go into that with our eyes wide open, knowing that the Mexico price segment that we're in right now is ultra-competitive. And so I think it's a pretty courageous thing by our company, and particularly by the Mexico team, to take on a very high-quality product in that segment and try to generate incremental value through pricing in a different blend of pricing and volume. So that's the whole idea there. And anywhere we see that in our company, we try to make sure that the businesses are attractive to us, and in that particular case, it needed some improvement.\n\n---\n\nAnd just so I understand it, there's new packaging marketing that comes with it or is this offsetting...\n\n---\n\nAbsolutely. No, no, yes, you try to work the whole mix. The product continues to be 100% agave. I mean, the el Jimador product is exceptional. I mean, really, it's across all 3 expressions. And so getting the value for it in the marketplace and, of course, we did repackage it here, I guess, within the last 12 months, so there's some packaging work and a lot of, what I'd say, trade relations and public relations that go with it. The sales force gets retrained on how to sell it, then you try to give it the support it needs so that it can actually justify it. So in some of these instances, you're actually willing to accept lower volumes going into it. I mean, you sort of expect that there's a customer who won't travel with you to the higher price point.\n\n---\n\nGot it. And then just on the Slane Castle acquisition, is there -- are there any kind of dilutive cost to EPS this year? I understand the $50 million is largely CapEx, but didn't know if you had start-up costs or other financing costs or something like that, which would be net dilutive to your guidance this year?\n\n---\n\nVery immaterial. I mean, we always are working -- we're working on brand positions and some of the initial development work, and we're doing that kind of work all the time, but it's immaterial early on.\n\n---\n\nAnd Paul, congratulations on getting there on the Irish deal. I had a couple of questions around it, if I may. Firstly, can you give us some idea of the size of the distillery? I know the family originally were looking to a much smaller investment a couple of years back and your $50 million is a lot more. Could you give us some idea of how large this could be? And secondly, just on the phasing of the spend there, if I understood Jane rightly, within the $200 million this year, there will be a reasonable amount to the $50 million, but not all the $50 million. Is that correct?\n\n---\n\nYes. I mean, Jane, you want to answer that last question and I'll talk about the...\n\n---\n\nYes, Ian, we're planning on starting construction this summer and the amount of money that I've announced, the $50 million are mentioned, it's not only for a distillery, but it's for building a couple of warehouses, which won't all happen right away, as well as the homeplace. So of the $50 million, it's not a -- not even half of it of what I anticipate being spent in this fiscal year.\n\n---\n\nYes, the initial investment there is around hospitality and enabling your distilling. Those are the 2 big ones. And Ian, if I think I've got this right, I mean, I think it would enable -- I mean, if you're going to build it for success, it would enable us, from a total capacity with that initial investment, to do an excess of 0.5 million cases. So I think it's 9-liter cases. So I think we would plan for success. I mean, with -- and just to give you a scale of it, Woodford Reserve is not that large now. So -- and we've been at that for 20 years. So I mean, just a frame of reference. So we would be enabling a generation of development maybe is the way to think about it.\n\n---\n\nThat's very useful, Paul. And just one quick follow-up. Jane, I think you answered the question on FX and EPS and you broke up. Could you just repeat what you said?\n\n---\n\nSure. What I had said was that it would be about -- he had asked, we're going to hurt by transactionals. As I said, we're still going to be hurt as the rates fell throughout the year. So we're still expecting a transactional negative impact but the translational absence of the $30 million this year will offset some of it, but not all of it. So we're still expecting a several cent hurt to EPS for fiscal '16.\n\n---\n\nI was just wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on what you're seeing on the on-premise versus off-premise. I was hearing that maybe we've seen a little bit of a slowdown in May. I don't know if you guys have seen that. And just generally, what you're anticipating going forward.\n\n---\n\nI mean, I haven't looked closely at the main numbers. I'm assuming you're talking about the United States?\n\n---\n\nYes, yes.\n\n---\n\nYes, I mean, it's been ebbing and flowing a bit. Sometimes I try not to get too fixated on it because of the weather and some of these other things. But I -- our assumption right now is that in the U.S. market, the off-premise will continue to be the driver. With the on-premise, at least the numbers I saw last time looked more flatfish as it's related to traffic. So -- but I would continue to remind you that I just think the study of that is so interesting in the world of social media today because of the way, at least in this country, it appears to us that the consumption formats and locations have changed because -- and have been enabled by what I call the crowd-sourcing ability of social media. And we've traditionally, because it's convenient to do so and very important to do so, bucketed it between on- and off-premise this. But I continue to observe more anecdotally that the off-premise environment increasingly is becoming mini on-premise environments as people host others, and some of that is affordability. Some of it is just buying by the bottle versus by the drink is more affordable. And one thing that you heard us phrase is that people are warming up, so they'll assemble at each other's residences or whatever and have a drink or 2 before they go have dinner and go to a restaurant or go to a bar. And so it's almost like there's just changing patterns of consumption in the U.S. market that I think are influential to trends and brands that might be relevant. But they also will change and show up, I think, over time in these metrics call just on-premise and off-premise.\n\n---\n\nThat's a good point. I would just build on to what Paul had said, and we haven't seen our own numbers and it just came out this morning as it relates to the on-premise. I agree with everything he said in terms of the change in what people are consuming and so forth. But for us, I will say through April, our results were actually trending quite well in the on-premise where we were flat over a year ago, and we've been trending -- continuing to improve month after month in both Jack Daniel's and our overall company itself has been above in EPS. And I think one of the big things we talked about earlier is really Old Forester. Tim Ramey mentioned Old Forester, I think, growing 35%. And it actually is the fastest-growing brand we have in our portfolio in the on-premise and is doing quite well.\n\n---\n\nYes. And we would expect, I would tell you, compared to the early experience we had on Tennessee Honey, we would expect Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire to have a little bit more of a skew to the on-premise versus the off-premise. I think it'll still be very off-premise successful too. But I think the early reception to -- from what we've seen to Tennessee Fire is a little bit better development in the on-premise than what we experienced from Tennessee Honey.\n\n---\n\nPerfect. And then just one last question, I don't think I heard you give an update on the situation with the wood cost and the barrel making cost, and if you could just give us an update on that situation and then how that plays into your 2016 outlook and guidance.\n\n---\n\nOkay. So what we've done, as it relates to that, we've taken more things under our control. We mentioned that we were investing behind a new mill in Indiana this year. And so that, along with being able to be supplied with the logs around it, will help us in terms of the availability as well as costs. I think right now just the overall dynamics with the bourbon and whiskey just growing like it is and the demand out there for new barrels is putting pressure, obviously, on the cost of wood. And so with that, we're seeing some stabilization, but it's definitely higher than what it's ever been. But if you flip it around and look at the other side of it, we also benefit from selling our barrels when they become used, if you will. So there's a two-sided coin to this, if you will.\n\n---\n\nWe have those higher, the costs, because they were already occurring in FY '15 and we have those incorporated into our estimates for FY '16. So they would be incorporated in our guidance.\n\n---\n\nAnd yes, just the -- I think maybe you were -- we -- if you're looking for what our cost increases for next year might be, I think will probably be still inflationary 2% to 3% range.\n\n---\n\nAs good as the growth is, and I think we can all see it and it's very reasonable for you to have the optimism you have, I want to probe on a couple of areas of risk that are on my mind. One is the cinnamon whiskey category here in the U.S. You're off to a very good start. Of course, Fireball started the category. But when you look at the momentum for the category, never mind whether it's Fireball or you or another smaller brand, what are you seeing in terms of momentum in terms of consumption at the point -- momentum at the points of consumption for that category? Is it picking up? Is it slowing down? Is it holding steady? So that's one question I have as I kind of think about the effect of your performance a year from now with Fire. And then the second is, on the subject of advertising, Paul, when we talked last quarter, I think you made a very compelling case that even if you yourselves grow mid-single digit in terms of advertising spend, which is lower-than-anticipated rates of revenue growth, that's superior to your competitors. Can you talk a little bit about what is the anticipated rate in the guide for fiscal '16 and whether there has been any change in your assumption and in planning for ad spend, given the anticipated rates of revenue growth?\n\n---\n\nOkay. I'll try to tackle those and, Jane, chime in as you feel. On the slowing down, I think though you would expect that the -- it will be interesting to see how Tennessee Fire adds to the, if you were to define the subsegment called cinnamon or if you were looking at it broadly as flavored. I would say that flavored generally, the leader in flavored whiskey has been decelerating, but off of very high levels. But then you would have the infusion of new entrants who continue to, like Tennessee Honey, being one that continues to grow nicely. But then our new entrant in cinnamon and then I think the aforementioned Crown Royal entrant, all those will be adding to the mix if you define it as flavored. Cinnamon, I would expect, just because of the very large volume level of Fireball to slow down with the passage of time, and whether or not Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire more than makes up at the category level, will have to be seen. But I would just -- if you just added up the volumes associated with these leading brands, I mean, you start to get bigger than entire categories that have been in existence in the United States for decades. I mean, so -- I mean, it really is a very interesting development phenomenon for the industry that you have to pay attention to, but be very responsible about. And I think there's -- I'm sure a part of your question about it is this stuff, just a trend that is going to bust and go away. I mean, there's nothing we can do about the categories. Marketing as it relates to that or the way that the consumer experiences it, we can control that a little bit in the way we market our brands. And so one of the reasons we've been so focused on the particular 2 that we have out there right now is to try to make them enduring brands. And there are ways you can market these things that give you a better chance of that than others. And I think being at the premium end of the category helps in some levels. I think encouraging versatility and mixability in the products is another attribute. To the extent that they engage new consumers is another attribute that can make these things be more sustainable. So there are a lot of things that we'll continue to study. But I mean, I'm a bit probably like you. We're looking at it, observing it. In our case, we're trying to compete within it. But also, we really don't know, but I would say so far, it continues to be ultra-impressive as it relates to the just sheer volumetric scale, in this country particularly, related to flavored whiskey. On the A&P, I think it is just continuation of what we've been saying. I mean, the lone exception to this year is probably more immediate around the launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire, it's sort of our new item, so you would expect that within the mix of Brown-Forman's investments. But if we were growing the way -- if I think back over time, if I was looking ahead, if we were growing at the rates we are, in the 6% to 8% range at the sales line, I mean, I just feel like -- as focused as we are and with some of the influences like Jane mentioned of dark markets and the line extension benefits that you sometimes get, I think mid-single-digit levels of A&P for right now feel about okay. I mean, I don't feel like -- I do think versus at least past practices that would gain share of voice. I don't know what our competitors will do in the coming years, but over the last couple of years out, I would still assess that we gained some share of voice.\n\n---\n\nThat's very -- okay, great. And if I could just kind of continue from a U.S. perspective, ask about a question that pertains to the gross margin evolution and we just got some color that was helpful on the wood cost. But on the last call, we also talked about -- and in this call, you've talked about wanting to expand the consumer base, which brings a certain incentive not to raise prices and even to promote a bit more. As we think about the gross margin evolution here in the U.S. for the total portfolio or the Jack Daniel's family, can you just talk a little bit more about how you're thinking about that average selling price at retail and what you need to do with the family, given what's going on within the larger bourbon segment, but of course, with also what's going on in the vodka segment?\n\n---\n\nYes. I mean, probably that's -- you just basically referenced the most artistic exercise that goes on in brand management. I mean, it really is. And I think on balance, so as you think about that challenge within the Jack Daniel's framework and let's use your example of the United States, simultaneously, what we're trying to do is to continue to -- and by the way, the brand Jack Daniel's Black Label finished in the United States in fiscal '15 at its all-time volumetric high level. I mean, it just is a wonderful attribute of a brand that next year will celebrate its 150th year in the United States. So I mean, it's sort of staggering to think about that and had some pricing. And also was the basis for the success of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey, Gentleman Jack, Jack Daniel's Single Barrel, Jack Daniel's Sinatra. And so the ability, the delicate balancing act is continuing to advance Jack Daniel's Black Label's brand equity, its net sales, its volumetrics, while also advancing these other consumer opportunities that maybe Jack Daniel's Black Label can't so readily or easily accomplish through its own programs and they're more efficiently accomplished through line extensions in these cases. And you have to be very selective, you have to be very thoughtful. In our case, we sometimes are a little more patient than people would like, but it's worked very well for us. And the thing I would point to is the level of cannibalization that we experience is so minimal and it's because we will continue to support Jack Daniel's Black Label while we're introducing Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire, for example. And when the line extension emphasis is on items that have higher gross margins, you effectively take the pressure off Jack Daniel's pricing and permit it to grow a little bit more volumetrically because what you would end up doing on the mix of Jack Daniel's whiskey is get a mix increase. You get an effective price increase because of the mix. And so elements of that are at play right now, and we like it. I mean, we actually like it. It's not that we're anti-price increase because we believe one of the elements of making Jack Daniel's continue to be exceptionally special, well valued is to keep its price premium. I would even refer to it today in most markets around the world as super-premium. So I hope that gives you a little more color on it. It is a really artistic exercise. I mean, as you can imagine, we -- I mean, I wish we could write even a road map for ourselves, but you are always dealing with the influences of the competitive environment around you. And so far so good and I think it's in our results. But it's wild that we get paid to do what we do every day.\n\n---\n\nA couple of questions. Can you just talk about the phasing of how we see Slane Castle come to market?\n\n---\n\nPhasing, coming to market with the Irish whiskey project.\n\n---\n\nYes. So the plan on the Irish whiskey project, if you will, is to purchase some new whiskey, if you will, that we can make our own products on.\n\n---\n\nFrom the bulk market.\n\n---\n\nFrom the bulk market. So we plan on starting to do that in F '16, hopefully, through our proprietary blending and so forth with it and go to market probably in F '17, if you will. What we're actually building now in terms of the capital and we won't have that all completed probably till F '17, early F '18, so we won't be distilling, making our own distillate, if you will, until about that time. So that actual whiskey that we'll be producing with the $50 million investment that I referenced won't be available until 2022. But in the meantime, we'll continue to purchase on the bulk market.\n\n---\n\nYes. So we'll have a product that we're very proud of that we haven't constructed yet that would be made and available for the 5 years while we're aging the product that we can, in fact, distill after 2017. So yes, we did it. Some of this, when you -- at least in my time, we've only done it once, which was Woodford Reserve. When we renovated the distillery and built out the distilling capacity, you wait a few years before the distillate comes in. And so I think the key thing is to make an excellent product. And that's one of the things about -- I mean, Irish whiskey, there's very few competitors and the products themselves are, I mean, generally and very genuinely of very high quality. So you're going to want to make sure you put something out there that works very, very well in the marketplace. So the standard, I think, for Irish whiskey is fairly high in my view.\n\n---\n\nAnd if I may on the pricing question. If you think about the mix that's going on in the U.S., specifically within U.S. whiskey, I mean, you're seeing average price per volume increases of 4% or more. I mean, how do you balance Black Label pricing with kind of the goal, I assume, of never having Black Label to be equivalent price to average price volume for the average U.S. whiskey?\n\n---\n\nWell, I'd have to look at your data. But I mean, traditionally, number one, it's so big within American whiskey, it helps to set the price for American whiskey. I mean, it at least certainly makes a big contribution. But again, I go back to that, how do we do it? I mean, we look at literally each half year or so to make sure we're comfortable with the pricing. And I mean, there's a -- if you think about this American whiskey market, I mean, most of the excitement right now is, if you just think about it on 2 dimensions, price up and down and flavor sort of going across or horizontally, there's so much interest in flavor. We talked about that early in the call and how large that segment's come. Well, Jack's participating in that and those brands, by the way, have excellent gross margins. We also are very much participating in the super-premium and ultra-premium expressions in the United States above us, and that's where a lot of the growth is too. There's been less buoyant growth in this category down at those very low price points. I mean, they're getting some halo effect from it, but it's really been the premium-plus, ultra-premium arena where we're playing, where a lot of competition is playing and then in the flavor, where we've also been successful. So I mean, I think all told, we will be advancing our sales dollars through the combination of and also because we also take price increases from time to time that we think are reasonable on Jack Daniel's, on Gentleman Jack, on Tennessee Honey. We take price increases on Woodford and its expressions. I mean, I can't tell you how impactful it is too when you look at an individual brand. The example of Woodford Reserve, which is growing very, very well, have been growing 30%, very premium priced, periodically takes price increases. But the impact of introducing Woodford Reserve Double Oaked at about double the price, what that does to the Woodford Reserve family overall, pricing is really exceptional. And so we're getting it through a combination of them. And I think what we're highlighting a little here today is in FY '16, we're just saying just expect a little bit less from pricing, more from mix, and in the sales composition, a little bit more from volume.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Paul and Jane, and thanks to all of you for joining us today for Brown-Forman's year-end earnings call. And for those of you who are planning on attending our Jack Daniel's distillery and cooperage tours at the end of June, we ask that you please RSVP by the end of this week, so we can make sure we have accurate counts. Thanks again for the time, and have a great week.\n\n---\n\nThank you, all.\n\n---\n\nThanks.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Vivien Azer (Analysts)】\nMy first question has to do with the outlook, please, for price/mix and if you could unpack that a little bit, price versus mix and how that might vary, U.S. versus international.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nOkay, I can take that. So we talked about the top line. We forecasted the growth in the 6% to 7% range, and we're forecasting that this next year, we have a bit more volume than we had this past year. So volume will be a bigger contributor to our top line growth than it has been this year. But we do continue to expect price to deliver and mix to deliver in the low single digits, a couple percentage points. But I will say what we're doing as it relates to pricing, we'll take a nominal pricing, if you will, in the U.S. and many markets around the world. But in some markets, we are being very focused on pricing. So for instance, I'll focus on el Jimador, which is our largest full-strength tequila. In the Mexico market itself, in our second year of pretty major pricing activity, so in the second year, we're repositioning the brand to be more premium and really kind of improve that brand business, if you will. And we think over the long term, it'll improve the equity of the brand, the growth of the brand, and most importantly, the returns on that brand. And so that's a place where we're focusing heavily on taking pricing. The markets where the FX hurt the results and where we see competitors also taking pricing such as Brazil and Russia, we're also taking pricing in those markets. And so we're obviously very -- looking around and being very aware of what's going on in the marketplace and where the economics support pricing and will take further if things happen to improve in certain markets. But that's kind of the way we're looking at volume and price/mix this next year. I hope that helps.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nYes, I might add one thing on this. I think it's helpful if you think about the pricing over a multiyear. I mean, if you go back a few years, we have been a little more aggressive, and I would say this year, we're leaning a little bit more on volume than pricing and the total mix and some of that is because we look ahead as well. If you think about the consumer trends and their volumetric interest, particularly for the premium brands where we're already very well positioned, this is a great year for us to get volume, I think. And in future years, because of the capital investments we've been making over these last many years, we'll start to see some of the costs associated with those commemorative [ph]. I think there'll be more responsibility on our part to try to cover some of that with pricing. So if you think about it over like I -- which we try to do over 3- or 5- or 7-year period, the balance of pricing and mix, this is a particularly good year, we think. And I think our people feel that way, too, when we did our planning, that this is a good volumetric year and so we lean a little bit more toward that. And we still get a lot of benefit from the mix, we think.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nYes, that's a good point, Paul. Just building on Paul's point on mix. You heard us talk about some of our brands -- Jack Daniel brands exceeding 2 million cases this year, our premium end, the Gentleman Jack, the Single Barrel and actually, the Honey brands, and those are our higher-priced brands, if you will. Those, coupled with if you get Woodford Reserve growing over 30%, those are higher priced and that mix alone, as they continue to grow, will help offset the mix.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nYes, they may become effective price increases on the whiskey.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Vivien Azer (Analysts)】\nAbsolutely, that's terrific. My second question has to do with your outlook for advertising spending please.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nYes. So I don't have specific -- I think what we've said, what we're looking to do next year is get, from our operating expenses, some leverage between operating expenses. Most likely it'll come in the form of SG&A. SG&A is the biggest of our 2 components, so we're going to continue to invest behind our people and we will continue to invest behind our brands. I think what you -- what I'd like to do is look, somewhat to what Paul said about pricing, is to look at what we've invested over the last 5 years, particularly as it relates to SG&A. And I think our stepped-up investment, whether it was in route-to-consumers in France or Turkey and Brazil and other places, we've invested quite a bit and we want you to think this is a good year ahead to start leveraging that. As it relates to A&P, we'll continue to invest behind our brands and the markets where we think that the consumers are willing to listen and where we can listen. I think one other point to -- important point to make here is on dark markets. More and more markets are becoming dark and so I think that we need -- we all need to be aware that people are the ones building the brands in those markets, so in those markets, you may see SG&A increase. So we kind of look at the things coming together. You got to have people to grow the brands and they've got to be there to support the A&P spends too.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nI think within the mix too, Vivian, you would -- as you would imagine, there's quite a bit of -- not quite a bit, but reallocation has been going on within our mix of A&P investment. So like for example in the first half of this year, you would expect us to be spending more money on Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire as it launches and we go out and support its initial reception in the marketplace. Our American whiskeys increasingly have been receiving more A&P because the trends are so favorable to them, and it might be coming like I note, like for example, last year, it came a little bit of the expenses and media budget for Southern Comfort, which had not been traveling as well its trend. So there's been some reallocations within the mix as well. But we think, because of the past investments and the level we're going to have of investing behind it now, I think we're pretty comfortable that we should still get nice leverage.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Faucher (Analysts)】\nWanted to follow up a little bit on some of the comments about the SG&A leverage on investment. And I guess, what I'm trying to figure out is, you improved the profitability per case by sort of bringing this stuff in-house, but there also was, I guess, a level of investment in terms of building that capability. So as we look at you cycling those, is it 2 benefits as we look out to fiscal year '16 in terms of the additional profit plus the lower spending? Or is it just sort of one benefit from that standpoint?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nYou might -- can I just ask you to clarify that? Which benefits are you talking about? I maybe missed the first part. Are you talking about the absence or presence of the French investment? I was trying to read into your...\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Faucher (Analysts)】\nYes. Well, I guess, what I would say is, right, my understanding is the investments in France create a business that is structurally a higher profit per case business. And then along with that, you have additional -- were there additional investments? So as we look at the leverage, are there 2 things driving the SG&A leverage as opposed to just 1, if that makes sense?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nLet me -- I'll take the first part of your question. The benefit from France happened in F '15 in terms of our net sales benefit that we're approaching. You're not going to have another benefit in F '16 as it relates to that. So if that happens -- but just to step back for a moment when we change these route-to-consumers is really what happened is someone else was representing us in the market and we were paying them a margin, so our sales were lower at the time. Now we brought it in-house, our sales are higher, and we brought the capabilities in-house and so that SG&A, which started when we geared up this route-to-consumer about a year ago, January, so we had 9 months of it in this fiscal year roughly that won't repeat itself again next year. So you will get a benefit from that next year, but we won't have that year-over-year increase, if you will.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nYes. So the -- it's now in the base and there will be less benefit to the sales line of incorporating it and less hurt to the SG&A line, of hurting it in F '16.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nYes. There's no more hurt coming through, it's in the base.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nIt's just in the base.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nWe somehow lost her.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Eric Serotta (Analysts)】\nIt's Eric Serotta in for Robert. Couple of questions with respect to flavors. First, on previous calls, you talked about Fire indexing at about 130% to 140% relative to Honey at similar stage of its development. I know you mentioned in this call it's also tracking favorably. Wondering if you could put some quantification around that. And second, hoping you could -- you, Paul, could talk a bit about flavors more broadly. Diageo is having a lot of success recently with Crown Royal Regal Apple. Wondering how you're thinking about whether a year-round apple variant for Jack is needed or next. Any context will be greatly appreciated.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nLet me take the first part and you take the second part?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nSure, it's fine.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nOkay. So yes, as we talked about, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire just got launched in our fourth quarter nationally. And we know there continues to be an enormous amount of interest in flavor, as you noted, in the U.S., and firstly, it was Honey just completing its fourth year and having the type of growth it had this year in the U.S. of 10%. So as we look at our read on Fire, what we had communicated last quarter, we have really just focused on our 3 test markets and we've now since had 5 other markets that we had expanded to in October. So we got a little bit more read and we feel very good about what we're seeing. It still is in the 130% range as it relates to how it's relating to the same period of time for the Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey launch. And so we know cinnamon is a hot category and we have -- we're very cautiously optimistic about the Tennessee Fire and what it could do for us the next fiscal year. And I'll turn it over to Paul to talk about flavors in general.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nYes. I mean, just building on what Jane said there, I think that, as a general comment, I think we're going to continue to pace ourselves correctly even with Tennessee Fire, which, in my view, sort of had a 3-stage introduction to the U.S. market. We even there want to continue to evaluate its performance in the marketplace. As you can imagine, with any Jack Daniel's product line extension in these cases, there's always an initial interest in it. I mean, it's just such a big and powerful brand and people give it the benefit of trial oftentimes. And so in the test markets for Tennessee Fire, we wanted to make sure that, that was repeatable, that people actually would get through any barriers that might have been perceived. The biggest one oftentimes for products that are labeled flavored is whether the product in the bottle is working in. Every indication we've had so far on Tennessee Fire is that it, in fact, is. So when you move beyond that for us, I mean, it's always to consider Jack Daniel's tends to enter very premium price points and that's again the case here in the cinnamon world. So you're trying to test what level of consumer interest and affordability shakes out, so that's something we continue to watch. And with the national scale launch now, as the months unfold, we'll have more and more data to look at to see how that particular aspect plays out. As it relates to the increasing competition and even you referenced one of them, there are no plans on our part right now other than really implementing the Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire and Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey plans that we have in place for FY '16. In general, you should expect us to continue to be cautious. The Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey sort of global rollout took 4 years, and I think with Tennessee Fire, beyond the things I've already mentioned related to what we'll evaluate there, Jane did mention these limited tests in a few of the international markets. We're going to want to look at those and read those. There's a lot of work still to be done and to be interpreted and evaluated before we consider anything beyond what we've done just now. But we will of course try to study the competitive landscape related to any flavor that's out there, so we can understand how it may impact the flavor entries we've got. So that's how we feel about it right now.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Eric Serotta (Analysts)】\nGreat. And just one housekeeping question, Jane. I think you gave specific guidance in terms of FX impact on net sales for fiscal '16. I know you said that the EPS impact or the earnings impact wouldn't have that headwind of the $30 million in translation, balance sheet translation. Did you give specific EPS guidance as to what the year-on-year headwind would be for FX?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nI did not, but you can expect it to be several cents.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Timothy Ramey (Analysts)】\nPaul, with respect to the list of superlatives that you rattled off, and I mean this truly is probably the best company I've ever followed in 30 years of doing research, I did note 2 things that we frequently talked about on calls that were not talked about today, SoCo and RTD. And I just wondered if you'd offer up any thoughts about sort of reigniting -- or stabilizing, reigniting growth, whatever it might be in those 2.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nYes. I mean, well, thank you for the comment, number one, and welcome to the call. I'm going to have you read it next time. No, honestly, the Southern Comfort one, we have talked about with regularity about the challenges in part of -- this is a very interesting dilemma for Brown-Forman, if you go back 5 or 6 years ago, that Southern Comfort was one of the key targets of all this competitive flavor success that other companies were having. And to be quite honest, our entry into flavored whiskey was a bit defensive. It was to protect Jack Daniel's and Southern Comfort and our company in some ways, and Honey emerged mostly to be, I mean, really to be fair, out of that. And then -- but I think our company and the people who launched it did a superb job of making it work in the marketplace in the way that it has. So Southern Comfort along the way, we've been -- we have been actually -- I feel like shoring it up. I really do feel like it would've been competitively deteriorating more had we not been taking some of the steps we've taken. And as I look at that growth rates going back 7 years ago, 5 years ago, 3 years ago, some of them have moderated. And some of that's come through what I'll call innovation underneath the Southern Comfort umbrella, and some of it has just been that there really is a core Southern Comfort user who likes the product in the bottle and is not going to be distracted by some of the flavor entries. And so we feel like we've done some of the best work we can do there with, particularly with advertising and communications. We felt like we've put forward a good step there. It's just competitively under assault. So I will say that from a corporate portfolio standpoint, when you add up the Southern Comfort volumes with the Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey volumes and what we hope will be a successful Tennessee Fire volumes, in the aggregate, they add up to nice growth for Brown-Forman's flavored portfolio, as you can imagine. On the RTDs, you make a point. I don't know if we mentioned it. We certainly mentioned it throughout the course of the year, but a lot of that is related to the difficulties of the Australia market and how competitive it's become, the difficulty really at the macroeconomic level for Australia right now, but also very much the competitive nature of RTDs down there. There's been some impact from competition. Southern [ph] has done very well down there, so it's taken some of the steam out of what has been a very nice progress over more than a decade for Brown-Forman largely under the Jack Daniel's name of RTDs. And we're not done with innovation there. We think there's still a lot of opportunity there, particularly when you consider that against the denominator of all single-serve beverage alcohol, which brings in the category of beer. So we don't quite have news to share on that today, but just trust that there will be a lot of work going on to make sure our RTD business remains healthy.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Timothy Ramey (Analysts)】\nGreat. And just one follow-up for Jane, if I could. The discussion of the fourth quarter tax rate, obviously, the quarter would have been much better if you'd had a more normal rate. And also, Old Forester, up 30-some percent or...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nYes, there you go.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Timothy Ramey (Analysts)】\nCan you elaborate on -- I mean, it sounded like you made comments, I think, in the release that suggest that it was getting more on-premise feature, is that correct?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nYes, I'll comment on Old Forester, let Jane tackle the tax one. But yes, the Old Forester, there's this irony since you've known us for so long. The brand, in some ways, became so small that it became cool and relevant again because that was our founding brand and it had been sort of chugging along at the 100,000 case mark for a bunch of years. And of course, everybody at Brown-Forman is very passionate about it because of what it represents to the corporation and to the family. But it has met its time is the way I'd say it. It is an exceptional value in the marketplace for the quality of bourbon that's in the bottle and the price the consumer pays. And I think that recognition has come about. There's certainly some retro appeal to it. And I would give a lot of credit to the teams that have worked on Old Forester because the expressions of Old Forester Birthday Bourbon that has been out there now for many, many years have reminded people of the quality. And I was struck just within a very short amount of time this spring, we -- I observed -- somebody sent me a copy of people standing in line to get the latest release of Old Forester Birthday Bourbon, right around the time that we announced that Old Forester would be flavored and be the mint julep of the Kentucky Derby. So there it was, working both dimensions of the appeal of American whiskey both premiumizing, but also adding flavor. And so I'd say Old Forester is at the sweet spot of opportunity for American whiskey at Brown-Forman and that's why we're investing in the way we are down the historic whiskey road behind the new distillery.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nOkay. And Tim, just to follow up on your question as it relates to the tax rate. It did come in a couple of points higher than what we had anticipated too. And the point of it was due really to a higher mix of our U.S. business, if you will, which, unfortunately, is taxed at a higher rate than we had anticipated if we had, had more earnings outside the U.S. So said another way, our earnings outside the U.S. were a little bit smaller than we had expected. That's about a point. The second point is what I would call more discrete in nature, more onetime in nature and it relates to foreign exchange transactions. And again, we wouldn't expect that to continue next year, assuming the rates stay where they are. So just as a reminder, I gave the forecast of a 30%, 31% for '16 is what we're assuming right now.\n\n---\n\n【質問: William Chappell (Analysts)】\nJust a couple quick questions. One, can you give a little more color on el Jimador and kind of what was alluded to in kind of the change of the pricing in Mexico and how that's expecting to kind of play out over the next few months or few quarters, I guess?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nYes. We can maybe -- I'll start it and Jane, you can add to it. Yes, I mean, I think part of it, Bill, we -- our company is not largely in the, what I'll call, the big local market categories. And the lone exceptions that actually we probably would have referenced over the last fiscal year would be the very sizable, at the popular price point, el Jimador business in Mexico. And then, the closest thing to that might be the Finlandia business, even though it's premium in that market, to the -- in the Polish market. And worldwide, a lot of those segments are -- have been under pressure for a while. And so we're not exposed to them too much and I think it's actually one of the reasons we have such nice competitive outperformance. But where we do have them, we try to improve them, is the way I'd say it. And our teams in Poland and Mexico have been busy working on corrective actions. In the case of el Jimador down in Mexico, I mean, it has our attention because we just think it's not that great a business for Brown-Forman at that price point. And so you get extra motivated to make sure the economics of the business improve, not only trying to get the thing to grow, but also the economics of it improve. And that one is unique because it's a, at that price point, it's a 100% agave product, which means it has a pretty significant amount of raw material commitment behind it for multi-years. And the way I see it, just sometimes the math doesn't work for that unless you go fix it. And so part of it is like the Herradura business, at a very super-premium price point, works pretty well the math for Brown-Forman. But lower price points doesn't work as well. Even the el Jimador business in the United States works reasonably well and because it's at a much more attractive price point than the Mexico price point. Now we go into that with our eyes wide open, knowing that the Mexico price segment that we're in right now is ultra-competitive. And so I think it's a pretty courageous thing by our company, and particularly by the Mexico team, to take on a very high-quality product in that segment and try to generate incremental value through pricing in a different blend of pricing and volume. So that's the whole idea there. And anywhere we see that in our company, we try to make sure that the businesses are attractive to us, and in that particular case, it needed some improvement.\n\n---\n\n【質問: William Chappell (Analysts)】\nAnd just so I understand it, there's new packaging marketing that comes with it or is this offsetting...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nAbsolutely. No, no, yes, you try to work the whole mix. The product continues to be 100% agave. I mean, the el Jimador product is exceptional. I mean, really, it's across all 3 expressions. And so getting the value for it in the marketplace and, of course, we did repackage it here, I guess, within the last 12 months, so there's some packaging work and a lot of, what I'd say, trade relations and public relations that go with it. The sales force gets retrained on how to sell it, then you try to give it the support it needs so that it can actually justify it. So in some of these instances, you're actually willing to accept lower volumes going into it. I mean, you sort of expect that there's a customer who won't travel with you to the higher price point.\n\n---\n\n【質問: William Chappell (Analysts)】\nGot it. And then just on the Slane Castle acquisition, is there -- are there any kind of dilutive cost to EPS this year? I understand the $50 million is largely CapEx, but didn't know if you had start-up costs or other financing costs or something like that, which would be net dilutive to your guidance this year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nVery immaterial. I mean, we always are working -- we're working on brand positions and some of the initial development work, and we're doing that kind of work all the time, but it's immaterial early on.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ian Shackleton (Analysts)】\nAnd Paul, congratulations on getting there on the Irish deal. I had a couple of questions around it, if I may. Firstly, can you give us some idea of the size of the distillery? I know the family originally were looking to a much smaller investment a couple of years back and your $50 million is a lot more. Could you give us some idea of how large this could be? And secondly, just on the phasing of the spend there, if I understood Jane rightly, within the $200 million this year, there will be a reasonable amount to the $50 million, but not all the $50 million. Is that correct?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nYes. I mean, Jane, you want to answer that last question and I'll talk about the...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nYes, Ian, we're planning on starting construction this summer and the amount of money that I've announced, the $50 million are mentioned, it's not only for a distillery, but it's for building a couple of warehouses, which won't all happen right away, as well as the homeplace. So of the $50 million, it's not a -- not even half of it of what I anticipate being spent in this fiscal year.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nYes, the initial investment there is around hospitality and enabling your distilling. Those are the 2 big ones. And Ian, if I think I've got this right, I mean, I think it would enable -- I mean, if you're going to build it for success, it would enable us, from a total capacity with that initial investment, to do an excess of 0.5 million cases. So I think it's 9-liter cases. So I think we would plan for success. I mean, with -- and just to give you a scale of it, Woodford Reserve is not that large now. So -- and we've been at that for 20 years. So I mean, just a frame of reference. So we would be enabling a generation of development maybe is the way to think about it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ian Shackleton (Analysts)】\nThat's very useful, Paul. And just one quick follow-up. Jane, I think you answered the question on FX and EPS and you broke up. Could you just repeat what you said?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nSure. What I had said was that it would be about -- he had asked, we're going to hurt by transactionals. As I said, we're still going to be hurt as the rates fell throughout the year. So we're still expecting a transactional negative impact but the translational absence of the $30 million this year will offset some of it, but not all of it. So we're still expecting a several cent hurt to EPS for fiscal '16.\n\n---\n\n【質問: William Marshall (Analysts)】\nI was just wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on what you're seeing on the on-premise versus off-premise. I was hearing that maybe we've seen a little bit of a slowdown in May. I don't know if you guys have seen that. And just generally, what you're anticipating going forward.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nI mean, I haven't looked closely at the main numbers. I'm assuming you're talking about the United States?\n\n---\n\n【質問: William Marshall (Analysts)】\nYes, yes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nYes, I mean, it's been ebbing and flowing a bit. Sometimes I try not to get too fixated on it because of the weather and some of these other things. But I -- our assumption right now is that in the U.S. market, the off-premise will continue to be the driver. With the on-premise, at least the numbers I saw last time looked more flatfish as it's related to traffic. So -- but I would continue to remind you that I just think the study of that is so interesting in the world of social media today because of the way, at least in this country, it appears to us that the consumption formats and locations have changed because -- and have been enabled by what I call the crowd-sourcing ability of social media. And we've traditionally, because it's convenient to do so and very important to do so, bucketed it between on- and off-premise this. But I continue to observe more anecdotally that the off-premise environment increasingly is becoming mini on-premise environments as people host others, and some of that is affordability. Some of it is just buying by the bottle versus by the drink is more affordable. And one thing that you heard us phrase is that people are warming up, so they'll assemble at each other's residences or whatever and have a drink or 2 before they go have dinner and go to a restaurant or go to a bar. And so it's almost like there's just changing patterns of consumption in the U.S. market that I think are influential to trends and brands that might be relevant. But they also will change and show up, I think, over time in these metrics call just on-premise and off-premise.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nThat's a good point. I would just build on to what Paul had said, and we haven't seen our own numbers and it just came out this morning as it relates to the on-premise. I agree with everything he said in terms of the change in what people are consuming and so forth. But for us, I will say through April, our results were actually trending quite well in the on-premise where we were flat over a year ago, and we've been trending -- continuing to improve month after month in both Jack Daniel's and our overall company itself has been above in EPS. And I think one of the big things we talked about earlier is really Old Forester. Tim Ramey mentioned Old Forester, I think, growing 35%. And it actually is the fastest-growing brand we have in our portfolio in the on-premise and is doing quite well.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nYes. And we would expect, I would tell you, compared to the early experience we had on Tennessee Honey, we would expect Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire to have a little bit more of a skew to the on-premise versus the off-premise. I think it'll still be very off-premise successful too. But I think the early reception to -- from what we've seen to Tennessee Fire is a little bit better development in the on-premise than what we experienced from Tennessee Honey.\n\n---\n\n【質問: William Marshall (Analysts)】\nPerfect. And then just one last question, I don't think I heard you give an update on the situation with the wood cost and the barrel making cost, and if you could just give us an update on that situation and then how that plays into your 2016 outlook and guidance.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nOkay. So what we've done, as it relates to that, we've taken more things under our control. We mentioned that we were investing behind a new mill in Indiana this year. And so that, along with being able to be supplied with the logs around it, will help us in terms of the availability as well as costs. I think right now just the overall dynamics with the bourbon and whiskey just growing like it is and the demand out there for new barrels is putting pressure, obviously, on the cost of wood. And so with that, we're seeing some stabilization, but it's definitely higher than what it's ever been. But if you flip it around and look at the other side of it, we also benefit from selling our barrels when they become used, if you will. So there's a two-sided coin to this, if you will.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nWe have those higher, the costs, because they were already occurring in FY '15 and we have those incorporated into our estimates for FY '16. So they would be incorporated in our guidance.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nAnd yes, just the -- I think maybe you were -- we -- if you're looking for what our cost increases for next year might be, I think will probably be still inflationary 2% to 3% range.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Swartzberg (Analysts)】\nAs good as the growth is, and I think we can all see it and it's very reasonable for you to have the optimism you have, I want to probe on a couple of areas of risk that are on my mind. One is the cinnamon whiskey category here in the U.S. You're off to a very good start. Of course, Fireball started the category. But when you look at the momentum for the category, never mind whether it's Fireball or you or another smaller brand, what are you seeing in terms of momentum in terms of consumption at the point -- momentum at the points of consumption for that category? Is it picking up? Is it slowing down? Is it holding steady? So that's one question I have as I kind of think about the effect of your performance a year from now with Fire. And then the second is, on the subject of advertising, Paul, when we talked last quarter, I think you made a very compelling case that even if you yourselves grow mid-single digit in terms of advertising spend, which is lower-than-anticipated rates of revenue growth, that's superior to your competitors. Can you talk a little bit about what is the anticipated rate in the guide for fiscal '16 and whether there has been any change in your assumption and in planning for ad spend, given the anticipated rates of revenue growth?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nOkay. I'll try to tackle those and, Jane, chime in as you feel. On the slowing down, I think though you would expect that the -- it will be interesting to see how Tennessee Fire adds to the, if you were to define the subsegment called cinnamon or if you were looking at it broadly as flavored. I would say that flavored generally, the leader in flavored whiskey has been decelerating, but off of very high levels. But then you would have the infusion of new entrants who continue to, like Tennessee Honey, being one that continues to grow nicely. But then our new entrant in cinnamon and then I think the aforementioned Crown Royal entrant, all those will be adding to the mix if you define it as flavored. Cinnamon, I would expect, just because of the very large volume level of Fireball to slow down with the passage of time, and whether or not Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire more than makes up at the category level, will have to be seen. But I would just -- if you just added up the volumes associated with these leading brands, I mean, you start to get bigger than entire categories that have been in existence in the United States for decades. I mean, so -- I mean, it really is a very interesting development phenomenon for the industry that you have to pay attention to, but be very responsible about. And I think there's -- I'm sure a part of your question about it is this stuff, just a trend that is going to bust and go away. I mean, there's nothing we can do about the categories. Marketing as it relates to that or the way that the consumer experiences it, we can control that a little bit in the way we market our brands. And so one of the reasons we've been so focused on the particular 2 that we have out there right now is to try to make them enduring brands. And there are ways you can market these things that give you a better chance of that than others. And I think being at the premium end of the category helps in some levels. I think encouraging versatility and mixability in the products is another attribute. To the extent that they engage new consumers is another attribute that can make these things be more sustainable. So there are a lot of things that we'll continue to study. But I mean, I'm a bit probably like you. We're looking at it, observing it. In our case, we're trying to compete within it. But also, we really don't know, but I would say so far, it continues to be ultra-impressive as it relates to the just sheer volumetric scale, in this country particularly, related to flavored whiskey. On the A&P, I think it is just continuation of what we've been saying. I mean, the lone exception to this year is probably more immediate around the launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire, it's sort of our new item, so you would expect that within the mix of Brown-Forman's investments. But if we were growing the way -- if I think back over time, if I was looking ahead, if we were growing at the rates we are, in the 6% to 8% range at the sales line, I mean, I just feel like -- as focused as we are and with some of the influences like Jane mentioned of dark markets and the line extension benefits that you sometimes get, I think mid-single-digit levels of A&P for right now feel about okay. I mean, I don't feel like -- I do think versus at least past practices that would gain share of voice. I don't know what our competitors will do in the coming years, but over the last couple of years out, I would still assess that we gained some share of voice.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Swartzberg (Analysts)】\nThat's very -- okay, great. And if I could just kind of continue from a U.S. perspective, ask about a question that pertains to the gross margin evolution and we just got some color that was helpful on the wood cost. But on the last call, we also talked about -- and in this call, you've talked about wanting to expand the consumer base, which brings a certain incentive not to raise prices and even to promote a bit more. As we think about the gross margin evolution here in the U.S. for the total portfolio or the Jack Daniel's family, can you just talk a little bit more about how you're thinking about that average selling price at retail and what you need to do with the family, given what's going on within the larger bourbon segment, but of course, with also what's going on in the vodka segment?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nYes. I mean, probably that's -- you just basically referenced the most artistic exercise that goes on in brand management. I mean, it really is. And I think on balance, so as you think about that challenge within the Jack Daniel's framework and let's use your example of the United States, simultaneously, what we're trying to do is to continue to -- and by the way, the brand Jack Daniel's Black Label finished in the United States in fiscal '15 at its all-time volumetric high level. I mean, it just is a wonderful attribute of a brand that next year will celebrate its 150th year in the United States. So I mean, it's sort of staggering to think about that and had some pricing. And also was the basis for the success of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey, Gentleman Jack, Jack Daniel's Single Barrel, Jack Daniel's Sinatra. And so the ability, the delicate balancing act is continuing to advance Jack Daniel's Black Label's brand equity, its net sales, its volumetrics, while also advancing these other consumer opportunities that maybe Jack Daniel's Black Label can't so readily or easily accomplish through its own programs and they're more efficiently accomplished through line extensions in these cases. And you have to be very selective, you have to be very thoughtful. In our case, we sometimes are a little more patient than people would like, but it's worked very well for us. And the thing I would point to is the level of cannibalization that we experience is so minimal and it's because we will continue to support Jack Daniel's Black Label while we're introducing Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire, for example. And when the line extension emphasis is on items that have higher gross margins, you effectively take the pressure off Jack Daniel's pricing and permit it to grow a little bit more volumetrically because what you would end up doing on the mix of Jack Daniel's whiskey is get a mix increase. You get an effective price increase because of the mix. And so elements of that are at play right now, and we like it. I mean, we actually like it. It's not that we're anti-price increase because we believe one of the elements of making Jack Daniel's continue to be exceptionally special, well valued is to keep its price premium. I would even refer to it today in most markets around the world as super-premium. So I hope that gives you a little more color on it. It is a really artistic exercise. I mean, as you can imagine, we -- I mean, I wish we could write even a road map for ourselves, but you are always dealing with the influences of the competitive environment around you. And so far so good and I think it's in our results. But it's wild that we get paid to do what we do every day.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Brett Cooper (Analysts)】\nA couple of questions. Can you just talk about the phasing of how we see Slane Castle come to market?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nPhasing, coming to market with the Irish whiskey project.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nYes. So the plan on the Irish whiskey project, if you will, is to purchase some new whiskey, if you will, that we can make our own products on.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nFrom the bulk market.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nFrom the bulk market. So we plan on starting to do that in F '16, hopefully, through our proprietary blending and so forth with it and go to market probably in F '17, if you will. What we're actually building now in terms of the capital and we won't have that all completed probably till F '17, early F '18, so we won't be distilling, making our own distillate, if you will, until about that time. So that actual whiskey that we'll be producing with the $50 million investment that I referenced won't be available until 2022. But in the meantime, we'll continue to purchase on the bulk market.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nYes. So we'll have a product that we're very proud of that we haven't constructed yet that would be made and available for the 5 years while we're aging the product that we can, in fact, distill after 2017. So yes, we did it. Some of this, when you -- at least in my time, we've only done it once, which was Woodford Reserve. When we renovated the distillery and built out the distilling capacity, you wait a few years before the distillate comes in. And so I think the key thing is to make an excellent product. And that's one of the things about -- I mean, Irish whiskey, there's very few competitors and the products themselves are, I mean, generally and very genuinely of very high quality. So you're going to want to make sure you put something out there that works very, very well in the marketplace. So the standard, I think, for Irish whiskey is fairly high in my view.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Brett Cooper (Analysts)】\nAnd if I may on the pricing question. If you think about the mix that's going on in the U.S., specifically within U.S. whiskey, I mean, you're seeing average price per volume increases of 4% or more. I mean, how do you balance Black Label pricing with kind of the goal, I assume, of never having Black Label to be equivalent price to average price volume for the average U.S. whiskey?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nWell, I'd have to look at your data. But I mean, traditionally, number one, it's so big within American whiskey, it helps to set the price for American whiskey. I mean, it at least certainly makes a big contribution. But again, I go back to that, how do we do it? I mean, we look at literally each half year or so to make sure we're comfortable with the pricing. And I mean, there's a -- if you think about this American whiskey market, I mean, most of the excitement right now is, if you just think about it on 2 dimensions, price up and down and flavor sort of going across or horizontally, there's so much interest in flavor. We talked about that early in the call and how large that segment's come. Well, Jack's participating in that and those brands, by the way, have excellent gross margins. We also are very much participating in the super-premium and ultra-premium expressions in the United States above us, and that's where a lot of the growth is too. There's been less buoyant growth in this category down at those very low price points. I mean, they're getting some halo effect from it, but it's really been the premium-plus, ultra-premium arena where we're playing, where a lot of competition is playing and then in the flavor, where we've also been successful. So I mean, I think all told, we will be advancing our sales dollars through the combination of and also because we also take price increases from time to time that we think are reasonable on Jack Daniel's, on Gentleman Jack, on Tennessee Honey. We take price increases on Woodford and its expressions. I mean, I can't tell you how impactful it is too when you look at an individual brand. The example of Woodford Reserve, which is growing very, very well, have been growing 30%, very premium priced, periodically takes price increases. But the impact of introducing Woodford Reserve Double Oaked at about double the price, what that does to the Woodford Reserve family overall, pricing is really exceptional. And so we're getting it through a combination of them. And I think what we're highlighting a little here today is in FY '16, we're just saying just expect a little bit less from pricing, more from mix, and in the sales composition, a little bit more from volume.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jason Koval (Executives)】\nThank you, Paul and Jane, and thanks to all of you for joining us today for Brown-Forman's year-end earnings call.

Given the continued momentum of our business in Q1, we believe we are well-positioned to achieve another year of strong revenue, profitability and cash flow. Some of the highlights for the quarter include Q1 total revenue and subscription revenue both grew greater than 20% in constant currency year-over-year basis. That makes 13 straight quarters of consistent mid-teens to 20-plus percent U.S. dollar growth in total revenues and subscription revenue, and we had record operating cash flow for Q1.\r\nLet me provide some additional details on the largest deals and renewals that closed in the quarter. Within our top 30 largest deal metric, all 30 deals were approximately $1 million or more. We also had 2 deals that were in excess of $10 million, a record for Q1. Cross-selling was strong, with 70% of the deals including 1 or more components from our group of application development and emerging technologies offerings. 7 of these deals were standalone application development and emerging technology offerings. You will see from the details that Charlie will provide in a moment, the growing adoption of these technologies continue to result in significant revenue growth. The top vertical for the quarter was financial services, followed closely by government. On the renewal front, I'm pleased to share that once again, we renewed all of the top 25 deals that were up for renewal. The total subscription value for these top 25 deals was approximately 115% of their prior year value. One should note that these results are in U.S. dollars and reflect strong sales execution.\r\nWith that overview, let me discuss some of our recent technology highlights. First, we released a commissioned survey of 310 IT decision-makers and professionals on their cloud initiatives. We were pleased to find that 75% of the respondents plan to use OpenStack. These respondents are looking to OpenStack to reduce time to deploy applications, lower costs and increase the agility of their IT infrastructure.\r\nIn addition, the types of applications the IT professionals intend to deploy on OpenStack are closely split between new workloads that are optimized for cloud and existing virtualized workloads. The study also found that most of the respondents are still early in the process of deploying OpenStack, and they noted that for broader deployment, many enterprise users are looking at offerings and support from commercial OpenStack providers like Red Hat.\r\nWe intend to be the vendor of choice for production deployments of OpenStack, and we will provide the global support, a broad ecosystem and technology expertise that we provide with our current RHEL infrastructure technology today. At the OpenStack Summit in Vancouver where Red Hat was a headline sponsor, we announced the industry's first integrated IaaS and PaaS solution based fully on open source technology. This solution known as Red Hat Cloud Suite for Applications integrates our OpenShift PaaS technology, our OpenStack technology and our CloudForms management technology. As organizations move to cloud, many are evolving their deployment efforts towards micro-services that run on containers to increase scalability, portability and efficiency. Red Hat's integrated Cloud Suite solution addresses this shift and gives users a faster way to deploy, develop and manage applications.\r\nNext week, we are excited to kick off Red Hat Summit in Boston, our premier event and one of the largest annual open source events in the world. Based on our record preregistrations, we are expecting a large increase to the number of CIOs, IT executives and developers to attend the event. I hope many of you will be able to join us at Summit to hear more about innovations and momentum across our portfolio, including containers, OpenStack, mobile, security, application development integration, storage and more.\r\nIn summary, we are excited about the trends we're seeing in open source development and usage as well as our increasing strategic position as an innovator that cloud customers and partners depend on. We remain optimistic about our outlook for the remainder of the year as Charlie will detail in a moment.\r\nOn a final note, I would like to thank all Red Hat associates around the globe for their continued commitment to our customers and partners that has translated into the strong financial results for our shareholders this quarter.\r\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Charlie.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Jim. Q1 was indeed a strong start to the new fiscal year. The results included higher-than-expected growth in virtually all of our key metrics even without the positive impact of the $5 million earned revenue adjustment, which I will describe in detail in a moment.\r\nFirst, let me update you on the impact of foreign currency on the Q1 results. As I previewed in Q4, nearly every currency in which we do business weakened significantly against the U.S. dollar when compared against both Q1 last year and last quarter. The significant change in exchange rates impacted not only our financial statements but also the statistics we provide on a quarterly basis. For instance, the year-over-year foreign exchange impact on total revenue was 850 basis points or a $36 million headwind. If you want additional currency rate detail, please see the rates which are posted on the IR section of our website.\r\nAs a result of the FX volatility, I'll provide both U.S. dollar and constant currency results for the quarter using the rates from Q1 last year. Some of the Q1 highlights include: year-over-year Q1 total revenue grew 22% in constant currency or 14% in U.S. dollars. In U.S. dollars, we exceeded the high end of our revenue guidance by $7 million, which includes the $5 million earned revenue adjustment. Non-GAAP operating margin was 23.6% compared to my guidance, which was around 22%. This result includes 70 basis points from improved operations and a 90 basis point positive impact from the earned revenue adjustment. Our operating cash flow of $209 million was up 27% year-over-year.\r\nNow let's turn to some of the details of our financial performance and outlook. On a geographic basis this quarter, 55% of bookings came from the Americas, 25% from EMEA and 20% from Asia Pacific versus a 56%, 25%, 19% split in Q1 last year. Our international sales teams performed well despite the foreign exchange headwind just discussed, and APAC experienced their normal Q1 seasonal strength.\r\nThe Q1 sales route mix was 75% from the channel and 25% from our direct sales force versus a 67%, 33% split in Q1 last year. The higher channel percentage was due to a number of large channel deals as well as a Q1 seasonal fluctuation toward the channel. We continue to target a long-term annual goal of a 70%, 30% split.\r\nAs I discussed on the fourth quarter call, our expectation is that the average contract duration this year will be around 21 months. For Q1, the duration was just under 20 months, which compares to 21 months in Q1 last year and 22 months in Q4. Our government business, which generally involves only 12-month contracts, was quite strong this quarter, which influenced the shorter average duration.\r\nNow let's shift to the income statement. As I discussed a few moments ago, the first quarter revenue was $481 million, an increase of 22% in constant currency and an increase of 14% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. The main driver of our total revenue growth was subscription revenue of $425 million, an increase of 23% in constant currency and an increase of 14% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. In U.S. dollars, this renewable revenue stream now constitutes 88% of total revenue.\r\nRevenue exceeded our March guidance due to the strong performance of the business, in addition to the $5 million earned revenue adjustment from our Red Hat Certified Public Cloud Providers or CCP. In prior periods, CCP subscription revenue was reported in arrears on a 1-month lag. Our ability to reasonably estimate the monthly revenue associated with these cloud providers has improved to the point where we no longer require a lag in reporting the final month of the quarter. Therefore, we are updating our treatment as of Q1 and on an ongoing basis of the earned revenue associated with these relationships.\r\nSince it's earned revenue and only -- it represents roughly 1% of revenue for the quarter, I'll describe the rest of the results, including this small adjustment. Looking at the subscription revenue breakout by technology, the subscription revenue for infrastructure-related offerings was $354 million, an increase of 19% in constant currency and an increase of 11% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. Subscription revenue for application development related and emerging technologies offerings was $71 million, an increase of 44% in constant currency and an increase of 34% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. Emerging technologies revenue is now approximately 15% of total revenue in U.S. dollars. As a reminder, our infrastructure-related offerings include mainly RHEL and RHEL-related offerings, including RHEL consumed in the Certified Cloud Providers program, while our application development and emerging technology offerings include middleware plus all of our newer cloud offerings. The training and services component of revenue was $56 million, and it was up 18% year-over-year in constant currency and 9% in U.S. dollars.\r\nNow I'll discuss the rest of our results on a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock compensation, amortization expense, transaction costs related to business combinations and noncash interest expense related to convertible debt, starting with gross margin.\r\nSubscription gross margin was 94%, up 30 basis points year-over-year. Training and services gross margin was 30%, down approximately 230 basis points year-over-year. This result was driven by a surge in demand for Red Hat consulting services in Europe, which had to be temporarily augmented by higher cost subcontractors and the scale-out of our emerging technologies consulting practice. Despite the higher cost in consulting services, overall gross margin was approximately 87%, modestly higher than Q4 and Q1 last year.\r\nNow moving on to non-GAAP operating expenses. Q1 non-GAAP operating expense came in at $303 million, up 9% year-over-year. Sales and marketing grew 10%. We had several successful sales and marketing events in Q1 that increased expenses, including the OpenStack Summit in Vancouver, as Jim referenced, partner meetings and global sales kickoff events. Further, we have continued to invest in sales headcount to drive future bookings, billings and revenue.\r\nR&D grew 8% as we continue to hire engineers mainly for our emerging cloud technologies. We also continued to show leverage in the G&A line, which declined to 7.2% of revenue compared to 7.5% in Q1 last year.\r\nQ1 non-GAAP operating income was $113 million, producing an operating margin of 23.6%, including the 90 basis point positive impact from the onetime earned revenue adjustment from CCP.\r\nNet interest and other income was modestly lower than Q1 last year at approximately $1 million due to the cash interest expense from the convertible debt.\r\nOur estimated annual effective tax rate was 29% for both GAAP and non-GAAP results, and the non-GAAP diluted earnings per share came to $0.44. Adjusting for the impact of the onetime CCP revenue, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share would have been $0.42, which is $0.01 above the high end of our guidance range. One should note that non-GAAP diluted weighted average shares outstanding excludes any dilution resulting from the convertible notes because any potential dilution is offset by our convertible note hedge transactions.\r\nNow let's turn to the balance sheet and the cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $1.97 billion. Quarterly operating cash flow of $209 million was up 27% from Q1 last year due in part to strong seasonal collections.\r\nFX adjusted DSO was within our target range at 59 days and down 1 day from Q1 last year. As a reminder, since day sales outstanding is traditionally a measure of receivables compared to billings, our DSO is calculated using our billings proxy, which one would calculate by adding revenue to the change in deferred revenue from the cash flow statement.\r\nTotal deferred revenue at quarter-end was $1.44 billion, an increase of $164 million or 13% over the same quarter a year ago. Current deferred revenue grew 13%, and long-term deferred revenue grew 14% from 1 year ago in U.S. dollars. Sequentially, and as expected from a seasonality perspective, deferred revenue decreased approximately $46 million from last quarter.\r\nTo isolate the foreign currency impact, let me break down the components of deferred revenue for you. Short-term deferred revenue, which ended Q4 at $1.095 billion, had a real decrease in Q1 of $19 million and further decreased by $10 million as a result of changes in quarter-over-quarter foreign exchange spot rates, ending Q1 at $1.066 billion. Long-term deferred revenue, which ended Q4 at $387 million, had a real decrease in Q1 of approximately $13 million and further decreased by $4 million as a result of changes in FX spot rates, ending Q1 at $370 million. The total decrease in deferred revenue without the impact of currency changes was $32 million and can be found on our statement of cash flows.\r\nOur rolling 4 quarters billings proxy is calculated by adding revenue plus the change in deferred revenue on the cash flow statements for the last 4 quarters. On a rolling 4 quarters basis, the billings proxy was $529 million, up 18% in U.S. dollars, a modest increase from a year ago quarter and continues to demonstrate the momentum in the business. On a constant currency basis, this metric would be up 22%.\r\nNow I'd like to turn to guidance factoring in the solid performance in Q1. For purposes of this guidance, I have assumed that average FX rates for Q2 and the balance of the year are as they were recently. For example, the euro was $1.13 and JPY 123 equaled $1. Compared to FX rates used in March this euro rate is slightly stronger while the yen rate is weaker. And the overall blended rates of more than 20 currencies we used is little changed.\r\nWith these assumptions in mind, we are reaffirming our full year revenue operating margin and cash flow guidance. As a reminder, the full year revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.990 billion to $2.020 billion or -- again, it's $1.990 billion to $2.020 billion, but I would say that I have high confidence in the high end of the revenue range. We are continuing to target full year non-GAAP operating margin around 23.3% as we invest for growth, particularly around our emerging products portfolio.\r\nFull year cash flow guidance remains at $670 million to $690 million. We are increasing our full year EPS guidance range $0.02 to $1.81 to $1.84 per share, still assuming a 29% annual effective tax rate. For Q2 specifically, I offer the following outlook: Q2 revenue is estimated to be approximately $492 million to $496 million; operating margin is estimated to be in the 23% area, including the added cost of the Red Hat Summit, which starts next week; interest and other income should be around $2 million; and non-GAAP EPS is estimated to be approximately $0.44, assuming the same 29% tax rate.\r\nConsistent with my past practice, I do not forecast quarterly cash flow. However, I would suggest that while estimating cash flow, you review the historical quarterly variations as a possible indicator of future seasonality.\r\nIn summary, we're off to a solid start to the fiscal year and reaching the $2 billion revenue milestone. We look forward to seeing many of you next Wednesday, June 24, at Analyst Day at the Red Hat Summit in Boston.\r\nAnd operator, I'd like to now turn it back over to you for the first question.",

      "transcript_text3": "I was just wondering if, Jim, you could share with us a little bit about kind of the key takeaways from the OpenStack Summit last week and if you could talk to us about where you think we are in the inflection of adoption away from kind of moving beyond the early adopters.\n\n---\n\nHeather, we're still working with the early adopters. It's -- we continue to be very excited about OpenStack. Hopefully, you'll get a chance to stop by at Summit and see some of the presentations we have with Cox Auto, FICO, Intuit and Santander, all presenting around OpenStack at the Summit. So we are certainly getting a lot of interest and a lot of usage. But it's still -- people are trialing it. It's still smaller. You'll see it really kind of start to ramp up as we go through this year. So again, we continue to be very, very pleased with the amount of interest we're seeing and the amount of trial and experimentation we're seeing, but in terms of really affecting bookings, we certainly had some good deals this quarter. But I think you'll see that is built as we go through the year.\n\n---\n\nJim, on the same topic, I saw some commentary a few days ago that OpenStack training is actually out-trending Linux certifications when you compare those numbers to the original Linux training certification program. And so I also saw a commentary that your -- the number of certified OpenStack professionals actually increased sevenfold last fiscal year. So I wanted to ask you, first of all, just why exactly do you think the dynamic is that strong in terms of OpenStack certification growth. And also, Charlie, do you have any target for growth in your OpenStack certifications for this fiscal year?\n\n---\n\nMark, I'll take the question because on the OpenStack training specifically, we invested heavily in a complete curriculum more than a year ago and rolled it out globally. As you say, the idea is to make it very pervasive like we did with the Red Hat Certified Engineer in the Linux side. The more people we have trained, the more people at our customers that are prepared to implement -- buy and implement. We've also rolled out extensive training internally, including trying to offer training to some of our own -- on the consulting side, people who have extensive RHEL experience, train them on OpenStack. So we're pushing it very hard. In terms of the specific numbers, we're now in the thousands in terms of certified Red Hat OpenStack engineers, and we hope that grows very rapidly. In terms of targets, I don't have a specific number to give you for the year other than we do believe it's very important to get more customers trained as quickly as possible. I think at the Red Hat Summit, you're actually going to -- there's various curriculums around training. There'll be more that you can learn at the Summit.\n\n---\n\nI was hoping we could get some color sort of entering the new fiscal year on kind of where we are in terms of the adoption of RHEL on the cloud service providers and, particularly, guys like AWS. You haven't given us the update yet, so I'm assuming we're still below the $100 million run rate. But is that starting to gain traction or more traction? Is it accelerating, decelerating? Something that we called out a while ago, we haven't really gotten much of an update on for quite some time.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Keith. It's a good question. For everyone who's not familiar, at the end of fiscal 2014, when we had an annualized run rate of $36 million, what we said is that when we hit a quarter of $25 million on an annualized run rate of $100 million, we would call it out. And I have said, I believe we'll see that quarter at some point this year. We'll have more to say about that at the Summit. But it's clear, it is still the fastest-growing individual piece of our business. It's not something that it's broken out separately because it's part of the infrastructure product grouping. But it's growing very rapidly. We now have near 80 Red Hat Certified Public Cloud Providers, and those are providing those services on a global basis.\n\n---\n\nGot it. And relatedly, being such a fast-growing part of the business, and something that the accounting is different for, and that you recognize it in arrears, is there any appreciable impact that we're seeing in the near term on overall billings growth? Have you -- you called it out, I think, 3Q last year. Or is that something that's not really a much of an impact on a go-forward basis?\n\n---\n\nIt's a good point. Clearly, this is immediate revenue when the service is provided. We earn it when the service is provided, and it's not the same as a subscription that's paid a full year in advance. So clearly, there is some change in the billing metric. More importantly, this quarter, we had very heavy government business. As Jim said it was the second largest vertical this quarter. And we do government business that's almost always just a 12-month contract and a 12-month billing. So it had some impact on the duration this quarter. As I said, it was less than 20 months. And so it had -- that had an impact on the billings metric. However, let me say this and sort of preempt the question, we are very proud of the billing statistics this quarter. If you look at simply the short-term billings, which means look at the change in the short-term deferred revenue, we had 24% growth on a constant currency basis, 15% growth in U.S. dollars. And that is a function of the shorter duration and the heavy contribution coming from government and probably also to your point, Keith, some coming from the public cloud.\n\n---\n\nTwo quick ones, please. We spent some time last month at OpenStack, and the one thing that was interesting is, obviously, the momentum that we saw in that market. But it's also -- what was interesting is to see the huge amount of vendors who are trying to play in that OpenStack game. With Rackspace, you guys were very public, and we had some of the old legacy guys there as well. How do you that market will play out? Because eventually, at Linux, you were kind of the last man standing. But how do you envision this to kind of play out for you guys? And what are kind of the things we should look out for? And then any comment on regional performance as well from Charlie maybe?\n\n---\n\nYes. Well, I'll start off on OpenStack. Hopefully, I was clear in my initial comments. We intend to be the Red Hat of OpenStack, and I think we're seeing good progress in that regard. Over the past year, say, past 12 months, we've seen a fair amount of consolidation as some of the smaller vendors have consolidated down. There are only a few vendors left who are offering an on-premise OpenStack product the way Red Hat is. We -- there's obviously no statistics on that. We think that we are the leader right now there. We have a huge certified ecosystem and the best track record of providing commercial-grade production open source. So we're highly confident in our capabilities and our position right now. And I think we're seeing fewer vendors or competitors this year than we saw last year, and I expect that will continue.\n\n---\n\nAnd Raimo, on the second part of your question about regional performance, we had very good performance from all regions. Unlike some other reports I've heard recently, our EMEA team performed well. And APAC, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, Q1 is always their seasonal high point. So we're very happy with the regional performance.\n\n---\n\nCharlie, I know you mentioned, you said you were excited about the billings number. But relative to where The Street was at, I think you came in a little light relative to perhaps we were all at. So I'm just curious if you could maybe drive -- drill in a little bit more so we can understand the puts and takes of what happened in Q1.\n\n---\n\nYes. So the starting point, to be honest, would be where The Street was at. I mean, I've done an analysis of the numbers and consensus and the spread. This is a number I don't guide. And so everyone's kind of left to their own devices. And we had a very broad spread of estimates from The\r\nStreet. And it's clear that probably 1/3 of the sell-side guys didn't get the currency part right, because there were very big numbers in some of those expectations that led to the consensus. I would say -- so let me just put that aside for a minute. I think as this currency play works out -- works along this year toward the end of the year, currencies will not be that much of a factor, if they stay at the current levels, because we have gone the full cycle. But for this quarter, Q1, Q2, there are a big factor, all the -- everyone needs to be thinking about to build it into your numbers. But to go back and just to talk about it. So billings are a function of the strength of the business and the duration of the contract. So this quarter, we had just under 20-month average duration. As I said, the short-term billings statistic, which would look at the change in the short-term deferred revenue, is -- perhaps a better indicator, 15% U.S. dollar growth, 24% constant currency growth. It's hard to imagine people would have expected much more than that. So -- but I do agree, the consensus number did have some kind of very wide variation of estimates in it.\n\n---\n\nIt looked like a very strong infrastructure quarter. You said 19% constant currency, up from 17%. I'm not sure if that included the $5 million or not and how that was related there. But either way, it was very strong. So I was wondering, a, can you tell me, one, if it was adjusted for that $5 million, that 19%? And then also, some of the drivers were there. Are you getting any benefit out of the Windows Server upgrade cycle? Anything in RHEL 7? What are the drivers behind that infrastructure number and how sustainable?\n\n---\n\nThanks. It's a good question. And yes, as I said in my prepared remarks, I did include it. So I would back out about 1% to take the adjustment out of there.\n\n---\n\nOn total, but on infrastructure, it's probably a couple percent.\n\n---\n\nIt may be 2%. Actually, you're right. It's about 2% on infrastructure. So perhaps 17%, if you back that out, still a very robust performance for the infrastructure segment. Frankly, I'm going to go through, at Analyst Day, the drivers. I don't want to ruin all of my stuff for Analyst Day. But one thing we know for certain is new workloads -- newer workloads are going to Linux. IDC statistics that I shared last year are slightly different, but overall, basically the same. That was showing a 14% shift from legacy operating systems to Linux and -- over a 5-year period of time. And we think we are going to be the primary beneficiary of that. So to me, that's one of the largest drivers. It's newer workloads. It's people wanting to be in an open hybrid cloud environment so they can easily move workloads back and forth from their own data center to multiple different public clouds or in a virtual environment, on bare metal, many different formats. But I would say, all the same drivers we've been talking about over the years still exist, that maybe a new driver is the broadened portfolio of products that we have, I believe, is now an additional driver to our RHEL business. People want to be on our operating system so they can use our other technologies.\n\n---\n\nJust one other comment. I would say, security is also helping. A heightened sense of security, awareness and concern at the board level certainly helps drive Free to Pay as well.\n\n---\n\nI just want to dig in to the others segment that's application development and emerging segment. That had a strong quarter, 44% constant currency growth. Just wondering if you could give some color in terms of any strength you have seen in any particular product, such as like Storage or OpenShift in this quarter. And also, sorry if I missed, do you have any number in terms of OpenStack or Storage component in your top 30 deals?\n\n---\n\nSure. I can share some of that. So first of all, I think one of the key drivers here is the significant improvement that we've made in our sales effort in terms of cross-selling. I think as Jim said, 70% of the top deals had an element of application development and emerging technologies in them. There was also a subset that was just the emerging technologies. I think some of the specifics, I think of the top 30 deals, 3 of them this quarter included OpenStack, a couple included OpenShift. We're still doing extremely well with Middleware. Even though the Middleware market is growing probably single-digit percent, we're growing very rapidly at a much faster pace. So we're clearly taking share there. But I think the bottom line here is we're doing a much better job in cross-selling. Our customers are -- many of them buying the entire portfolio.\n\n---\n\nYes, I would just add. On the numbers, you talked about, obviously, revenue numbers. And so we're seeing solid growth across the board. I'd say, in particular, some of our higher value-added Middleware, things like Fuse and Integration, things like SOA, are doing extremely well. Storage continues to grow off of a still small base but grow extremely rapidly. And certainly, the new products are growing -- the OpenShift, et cetera, are growing really, really fast. So solid across the board in that whole set of products that continue to grow double, up to some triple digit kind of growth numbers on some of those.\n\n---\n\nYes, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about how Red Hat is partnering with some of the telecom equipment vendors as it relates to NFV and the need for OpenStack. It seems to me that maybe is a little further along than the enterprise. But if you could just give us some color on what you're doing there. And where are -- where is telecom versus enterprise in your view right now?\n\n---\n\nWell, I would certainly say, telecom is further along in thinking about OpenStack as it relates to their operating side of the business, which is great to see. We're actively engaged both with -- in customer telcos as well as the equipment providers. We've made announcements with Alcatel-Lucent and with Huawei and, I believe, others. What I would say is next week, when we're together, we can go into more detail, when Paul Cormier is there, can go into more detail at Summit on that.\n\n---\n\nI'd like to have an OpenStack question for Jim, and it just relates to customers that are vSphere customers. They're going to have the opportunity to -- if they want on vSphere under Red Hat OpenStack or under the new VMware OpenStack. Why would a vSphere customer choose Red Hat OpenStack over VMware? And then just a quick question, Charlie. Was there any impact to deferred revenue on the earned revenue adjustment?\n\n---\n\nI'll answer the first part, and Charlie can do the second. Well, first off, VMware's support of OpenStack, we're happy to compete against that any day. We are a significant contributor, and we're all in around OpenStack. It's not an afterthought or a defense move to try to protect the core. And so, I think for a lot of companies that are looking to move away from expensive proprietary lock-in, doubling down with an expensive proprietary company, probably doesn't make the most sense there. And so we have not -- and it's early days, admittedly, but we have not seen a whole lot of interest at least from the customers I've talked to around the VMware OpenStack solution. Again, it's -- it does not behoove them to get people to use that relative to their core. And again, we actually look at offering ability to support open source projects, ecosystem, et cetera. We think we have a huge differentiated value proposition not only versus VMware but, really, against anyone else offering OpenStack product.\n\n---\n\nSteve, on the second part of your question, the CCP revenue adjustment had no impact on deferred revenue.\n\n---\n\nOne for Jim, one for Charlie. Jim, one of the trends that's impressing me these days is the ramp in enterprise adoption of open source infrastructure. I'm continually alarmed by its terrific tailwind for you guys. At the same time though, Red Hat still gets roughly 85% of your subscription mix from the core RHEL infrastructure. And I'm just wondering, as you see enterprise adoption of open source ramp, how that changes your predilection to expand Red Hat suite and take advantage of that broader adoption curve. And then for Charlie, if the CCP true-up of $5 million is for 1 month, could we assume then that your annualized cloud subscription bookings must be $60 million?\n\n---\n\nAll right. Well, look, I mean, I think we said that on a constant currency basis, our non--RHEL business grew at 44%. So clearly, our other offerings are growing quite rapidly. We've continued to add offerings. Over the last several years, we've made a couple of acquisitions in software-defined storage. We've entered the PaaS market. And more recently, in the past 12 months, we've bought a company called FeedHenry and have entered the mobile back-end business. And so we do continue to add, and we continue to look for opportunities to add. We -- I think you rightly pointed out, open source is becoming more mainstream and considered more innovative in our customers' minds. That means that we have a very opportunity-rich environment because we are seen as the leading trusted open source company. For us, it's a matter of how fast we can invest, how much we can kind of bite off. In the product categories we're in, there's more than a $50 billion total addressable market. So we need to continue to execute taking share in those categories, but we'll certainly continue to look to add other categories in the future.\n\n---\n\nOn the second part of the question, relative to the true-up, I guess, my comment would be, I wouldn't make any assumptions about what it means on the run rate. I would revert back to my comment. I believe that during this year and maybe by the end of this year, we will be at a $100 million run rate, but we'll call that out when we get there.\n\n---\n\nCan you give us a sense for what percentage of your customers have migrated to RHEL 7? I know there isn't a specific price increase for that release, but do you generally see ASPs increase through cross-selling upon this migration? Or is the benefit you're seeing from some of these cross-sell just due to the natural cadence and maturity of some of these emerging businesses?\n\n---\n\nAbout 50% of our customers are using RHEL 7 to some extent. That doesn't mean they're totally using it, but they're using it in some ways. Recognize, that's heavily driven by when they are migrating applications. Typically, once you have something on an OS, you don't want to move it. So a lot of that has to do with just how much churn they have in their own application portfolio. In terms of does that drive cross-sell, I think a lot of the strength that we're seeing in the other product category is those products are maturing. So things like our -- on the Middleware side, integration or business rules in those things. We've kind of gone from having good products to having truly great products that are still dramatically cheaper than competitors. And so I do think we're just seeing our own product suite maturing in combination with -- CIOs really have gone, I think, in the last several years from thinking of open source as okay technology that's really cheap to kind of really owning a mind space around innovation more and more. And that just certainly helps because it's easier to have a conversation about new products when you're in that kind of mind quadrant of the CIO that this is a strategic vendor that also delivers innovative product.\n\n---\n\nCharlie, largely, metrics are extremely strong, and currency seems to be a slight tailwind versus the last call. And you just beat revenues in the quarter even after adjusting for the CCP adjustment. So why not raise full year revenue outlook by the corresponding amount? What are you seeing that's making you cautious for rest of the year?\n\n---\n\nI guess, the only thing I can say about that is look at my history of setting guidance. And relative to the actual performance of the last 11 years, I have set this guidance with the same kind of a standard that I've done historically. I don't have any real concerns over the rest of the year. I think Jim and I both said, we think Q1 was a strong start, and it's progressing well. So that's probably all I have to say on that topic, I think.\n\n---\n\nThis is actually Tyler Radke on for Walter. I had a question. With the customers you're seeing traction on the OpenStack side, what type of uplift are you getting on servers?\n\n---\n\nIs your question on -- you can say, on servers. Do you mean on a number of RHEL subscriptions, the base operating system?\n\n---\n\nCorrect, yes. Yes.\n\n---\n\nOur RHEL OpenStack product is actually a bundle, which includes RHEL and OpenStack. It's all 1 product. So it's kind of 1 for 1. But it's entirely possible that, as I said before, people getting ready to go OpenStack may be adopting RHEL faster to move the operating systems in their data centers in our direction. I mean, that could be a byproduct. But basically, when we sell a subscription for OpenStack, it's bundled with RHEL.\n\n---\n\nA quick update on the CFO search. And secondly, when you look at OpenStack, just as a conceptual idea, back during the days when Red Hat was a small company, Linux was displacing Unix and there was a replacement cycle targeted very expensive legacy systems. So you had the bad guys to target, and you are the good guys. And you were the savior of corporate IT department. When you look at OpenStack, it feels like that same argument does not apply. And Red Hat is now a bigger company. You've got more enemies. You had a lot of friends back those days, that's actually a good thing. And it's not a replacement market, it's a market where there's a lot of new innovation. So conceptually, how does Red Hat exploit -- well, how much of your background is becoming the open source Linux operating system dominant provider does actually apply in this new OpenStack core?\n\n---\n\nYes. Sure. Well, so first off, on your first question, we do hope to have an update for you on the search at Analyst Day next week. So please join us then and I hope to have an update for you at that time. In terms of OpenStack, I do think you point out some differences in kind of market. I actually look at all of those as quite a positive thing for Red Hat because we've already established ourselves as a significant vendor to most large enterprise IT. We're a core part of their production ecosystem. So we're strategic for that reason, and we are now offering more innovative product. So we have a seat at the table, and we can talk about innovation. And those 2 things together really do make us very strategic. It also kind of opens up the size of market opportunity. So when you're going in there commoditizing a market, the size of the market is the market that currently exists and you then price underneath that umbrella. But it's a logical market size. With our newer, more innovative products, whether it's OpenStack or OpenShift or some of our mobile technologies, the size of the market is limited by the business opportunities created by those technologies. So it gives us a much greater ability to kind of come in and talk about the value of those things rather than just the cost savings, which admittedly is a more complex sell. And so one of the reasons you've heard us talk over the last, really, 2 years about investments in sales and marketing is that they are longer sales cycles. But the ultimate results are deeper relationships at a higher level in the organization and larger contracts, which I think you've seen us continue to deliver. I think if it hadn't been for Linux and we were coming in brand-new to this, it would be really hard to have that same level of mind share with the CIO. But because we're there, we have it. And secondly, especially, and this is particularly to OpenStack, which you asked about, the certified ecosystem of hardware providers and management tool vendors that we have kind of carry over from RHEL into OpenStack, right? So -- and which gives us just an incremental benefit as well.\n\n---\n\nJim, haven't heard any commentary on RHEV yet. Just wondering how that's been performing. And then secondly, realizing that we're only a few months in, what has the customer response to RHEL Atomic Host been like so far?\n\n---\n\nWell, I would say, RHEV, that is actually bundled into the infrastructure group. So we don't break out any detail there. In general, I think we've all been surprised at how well it's done over the last, really, year, not just this quarter. As just I think as people are starting to use more Red Hat technologies, they picked it up. Obviously, we've been focusing hard on OpenStack, but it seems to be driving solid performance on the RHEV side. Second part?\n\n---\n\nContainers [indiscernible] in Atomic.\n\n---\n\nYes, containers. It's too early to have kind of significant sales around RHEL Atomic. We're getting phenomenal interest. And the level of engagement in general we're getting around containers with our customers is huge. And that's both on the RHEL side and on the OpenShift side. So what I would say is come to Analyst Day next week and you'll hear a lot more about what we're doing as well as the traction that, that's getting us with customers.\n\n---\n\nJust a question on the growth rates. For a long time, you talked about being sort of a mid-teens to high-teens grower, and that seemed a good rate for RHEL. But you've clearly, for the last few quarters at least, been exceeding 20%. And it looks like that's coming from upsell of some of the emerging products. Can you talk about what is sort of a more natural growth rate? And then the second part is, given that the growth is doing quite well, why aren't we seeing a bit more leverage, particularly in the operating margin?\n\n---\n\nHeather, on -- I mean...\n\n---\n\nKatherine.\n\n---\n\nKatherine, sorry. Katherine, on the longer-term goal, it's been our philosophy not to talk about goals beyond the year. But you rightly point out that the performance over the last 4 quarters, maybe 5 quarters now, has been pretty stellar. And I think going back to last year's Analyst Day, when we first begin breaking out the 2 product groupings, I mean, it was an interesting revelation that the operating system side or the infrastructure-related side has performed very solidly, sort of mid-teens. And of course, the other part was that the emerging products group is growing at a much, much faster pace. We have not published any longer-term goals, so I don't think it's appropriate at this point to talk about it. But we are going to talk about some things in more depth next week at the Analyst Day, including some of the drivers, and so that's probably a point where maybe you can get some more detail on that.\n\n---\n\nAnd on margin, as we continued to say, we have a huge opportunity out there, and we are investing into it. These are large markets that make us very, very strategic. But as I said earlier, they have longer sales cycles. And so as we've generated stronger performance, we -- it's allowed us to invest more in sales and marketing, which we get that strong performance. So we do believe, as we've said for a long time, we think there's a lot of scale in the business. But right now, we have such a large opportunity to grow and establish ourselves as the leader in these categories, that we continue to do that.\n\n---\n\nKatherine, I'll have a little bit more detail on the margin since I'm benchmarking it in my prepared remarks for Analyst Day, so we'll see you there.\n\n---\n\nThe Platform-as-a-Service, you finally bust it up in terms of adoption [indiscernible] kind of some of [indiscernible].\n\n---\n\nDerrick, your phone line is breaking up. I think I heard Platform-as-a-Service, but past that, try again.\n\n---\n\nOkay. I was saying that it seems to be bubbling up a little bit more in terms of adoption. I'm just hoping to get some kind of use cases that you're seeing out there on the OpenShift platform. And I know you've got version 3 coming out later this year. Curious how you think about that in terms of driving adoption. And then a follow-up for Charlie. The revenue guidance, I'm just wondering if you could quantify the foreign currency impact assumed in your revenue guidance.\n\n---\n\nYes. Well, I'll start off. Well, first off, I'd encourage you to come to Summit next week. We have Barclays, Blue Cross, Blue Shield, VA [ph], Citi and DreamWorks, all presenting on their use of OpenShift. As you said, the version 3 has gotten tremendous interest really because of containers. People are looking for a production platform to run containers. And right now, while not GA-ed, version 3, which is -- supports Docker and Kubernetes or provides Docker and Kubernetes in a supported way, is something that's getting a lot of enterprises very excited. So I do think as that marches forward, that will be an additional driver. Both a differentiator versus other offerings, but certainly a driver of growth for OpenShift.\n\n---\n\nOn the revenue guidance, in terms of the rates I've used, what I said was that the euro is a little stronger, the yen is a little bit weaker, but the overall basket of currencies is about the same as it was when I set the original guidance. So there's no incremental currency impact compared to what I did in -- at the start of the year in the guidance I just gave. So what you should take away is -- the key thing I think is I have high confidence in the top of the range, which is $2.20 billion.\n\n---\n\nFrom time to time, you've talked about your embedded business, and I was wondering if you could characterize at least qualitatively if not quantitatively the impact that it's having both on infrastructure as well as some of the emerging technologies.\n\n---\n\nWell, at this point, we don't break it out. It actually -- the SKUs actually split across that because there's obviously the RHEL component, which is in infrastructure, and there's the messaging application platform kind of component stuff that sits in the other business unit. So it's spread right now across both. I think we have a really nice opportunity there. We are beginning to invest more in the area. It's not to the point of something I could really break out. We've always had a degree of it in our business. But we continue to see more opportunities that are working with more of our customers on it.\n\n---\n\nCharlie, I was just wondering, when you think about investments -- I imagine you're going to get into this a little bit next week. But you guys obviously have a much broader product portfolio today than you did a few years ago. So you spend a lot on R&D. Just from a go-to-market perspective, I guess, what's the thought process on broadening your own direct sales force to take advantage of this, to really push harder, since we're at the very early stages of adoption of OpenStack, just to make sure that you guys are talking to. Now, I guess, the question is, do you have enough feet on the street from a direct perspective? I assume some of the investment you're embedding is around that, but I was just curious if that's going to be sort of escalating over the next 12 months perhaps.\n\n---\n\nGreat, Kirk. First of all, last but not least, we're glad that you got on the call. So as we've said, really, for the last several years, we're investing for growth. And I think you can see the benefit of it in the cross-sell activity that's really starting to take off here. We've added a lot to sales and marketing over that period of time. And we have explained to the buy side that when you have this kind of a growth opportunity, you need to keep investing because you need to get the share while you can get it. And we are still trying to hire salespeople pretty much as fast as we can go. And we have some specialties that probably in higher demand than others, but we're adding to sales and engineering this year. We've got an aggressive recruiting schedule. At the Vancouver OpenStack Summit, for example, we had a special team of recruiters on site and looking for OpenStack professionals. And so if you all know of some of those, refer them our way. But I think the sales recruiting in this -- and what we've done in building our sales is really showing up now in what you're seeing in the emerging products growth statistics. And so we will keep doing that.\n\n---\n\nEveryone, this now concludes the first quarter earnings call, and we look forward to seeing many of you next week at Summit. Thank you very much for your time.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Heather Bellini (Analysts)】\nI was just wondering if, Jim, you could share with us a little bit about kind of the key takeaways from the OpenStack Summit last week and if you could talk to us about where you think we are in the inflection of adoption away from kind of moving beyond the early adopters.\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nHeather, we're still working with the early adopters. It's -- we continue to be very excited about OpenStack. Hopefully, you'll get a chance to stop by at Summit and see some of the presentations we have with Cox Auto, FICO, Intuit and Santander, all presenting around OpenStack at the Summit. So we are certainly getting a lot of interest and a lot of usage. But it's still -- people are trialing it. It's still smaller. You'll see it really kind of start to ramp up as we go through this year. So again, we continue to be very, very pleased with the amount of interest we're seeing and the amount of trial and experimentation we're seeing, but in terms of really affecting bookings, we certainly had some good deals this quarter. But I think you'll see that is built as we go through the year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Murphy (Analysts)】\nJim, on the same topic, I saw some commentary a few days ago that OpenStack training is actually out-trending Linux certifications when you compare those numbers to the original Linux training certification program. And so I also saw a commentary that your -- the number of certified OpenStack professionals actually increased sevenfold last fiscal year. So I wanted to ask you, first of all, just why exactly do you think the dynamic is that strong in terms of OpenStack certification growth. And also, Charlie, do you have any target for growth in your OpenStack certifications for this fiscal year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nMark, I'll take the question because on the OpenStack training specifically, we invested heavily in a complete curriculum more than a year ago and rolled it out globally. As you say, the idea is to make it very pervasive like we did with the Red Hat Certified Engineer in the Linux side. The more people we have trained, the more people at our customers that are prepared to implement -- buy and implement. We've also rolled out extensive training internally, including trying to offer training to some of our own -- on the consulting side, people who have extensive RHEL experience, train them on OpenStack. So we're pushing it very hard. In terms of the specific numbers, we're now in the thousands in terms of certified Red Hat OpenStack engineers, and we hope that grows very rapidly. In terms of targets, I don't have a specific number to give you for the year other than we do believe it's very important to get more customers trained as quickly as possible. I think at the Red Hat Summit, you're actually going to -- there's various curriculums around training. There'll be more that you can learn at the Summit.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Keith Weiss (Analysts)】\nI was hoping we could get some color sort of entering the new fiscal year on kind of where we are in terms of the adoption of RHEL on the cloud service providers and, particularly, guys like AWS. You haven't given us the update yet, so I'm assuming we're still below the $100 million run rate. But is that starting to gain traction or more traction? Is it accelerating, decelerating? Something that we called out a while ago, we haven't really gotten much of an update on for quite some time.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nThanks, Keith. It's a good question. For everyone who's not familiar, at the end of fiscal 2014, when we had an annualized run rate of $36 million, what we said is that when we hit a quarter of $25 million on an annualized run rate of $100 million, we would call it out. And I have said, I believe we'll see that quarter at some point this year. We'll have more to say about that at the Summit. But it's clear, it is still the fastest-growing individual piece of our business. It's not something that it's broken out separately because it's part of the infrastructure product grouping. But it's growing very rapidly. We now have near 80 Red Hat Certified Public Cloud Providers, and those are providing those services on a global basis.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Keith Weiss (Analysts)】\nGot it. And relatedly, being such a fast-growing part of the business, and something that the accounting is different for, and that you recognize it in arrears, is there any appreciable impact that we're seeing in the near term on overall billings growth? Have you -- you called it out, I think, 3Q last year. Or is that something that's not really a much of an impact on a go-forward basis?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nIt's a good point. Clearly, this is immediate revenue when the service is provided. We earn it when the service is provided, and it's not the same as a subscription that's paid a full year in advance. So clearly, there is some change in the billing metric. More importantly, this quarter, we had very heavy government business. As Jim said it was the second largest vertical this quarter. And we do government business that's almost always just a 12-month contract and a 12-month billing. So it had some impact on the duration this quarter. As I said, it was less than 20 months. And so it had -- that had an impact on the billings metric. However, let me say this and sort of preempt the question, we are very proud of the billing statistics this quarter. If you look at simply the short-term billings, which means look at the change in the short-term deferred revenue, we had 24% growth on a constant currency basis, 15% growth in U.S. dollars. And that is a function of the shorter duration and the heavy contribution coming from government and probably also to your point, Keith, some coming from the public cloud.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Raimo Lenschow (Analysts)】\nTwo quick ones, please. We spent some time last month at OpenStack, and the one thing that was interesting is, obviously, the momentum that we saw in that market. But it's also -- what was interesting is to see the huge amount of vendors who are trying to play in that OpenStack game. With Rackspace, you guys were very public, and we had some of the old legacy guys there as well. How do you that market will play out? Because eventually, at Linux, you were kind of the last man standing. But how do you envision this to kind of play out for you guys? And what are kind of the things we should look out for? And then any comment on regional performance as well from Charlie maybe?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nYes. Well, I'll start off on OpenStack. Hopefully, I was clear in my initial comments. We intend to be the Red Hat of OpenStack, and I think we're seeing good progress in that regard. Over the past year, say, past 12 months, we've seen a fair amount of consolidation as some of the smaller vendors have consolidated down. There are only a few vendors left who are offering an on-premise OpenStack product the way Red Hat is. We -- there's obviously no statistics on that. We think that we are the leader right now there. We have a huge certified ecosystem and the best track record of providing commercial-grade production open source. So we're highly confident in our capabilities and our position right now. And I think we're seeing fewer vendors or competitors this year than we saw last year, and I expect that will continue.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nAnd Raimo, on the second part of your question about regional performance, we had very good performance from all regions. Unlike some other reports I've heard recently, our EMEA team performed well. And APAC, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, Q1 is always their seasonal high point. So we're very happy with the regional performance.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Brent Thill (Analysts)】\nCharlie, I know you mentioned, you said you were excited about the billings number. But relative to where The Street was at, I think you came in a little light relative to perhaps we were all at. So I'm just curious if you could maybe drive -- drill in a little bit more so we can understand the puts and takes of what happened in Q1.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nYes. So the starting point, to be honest, would be where The Street was at. I mean, I've done an analysis of the numbers and consensus and the spread. This is a number I don't guide. And so everyone's kind of left to their own devices. And we had a very broad spread of estimates from The\r\nStreet. And it's clear that probably 1/3 of the sell-side guys didn't get the currency part right, because there were very big numbers in some of those expectations that led to the consensus. I would say -- so let me just put that aside for a minute. I think as this currency play works out -- works along this year toward the end of the year, currencies will not be that much of a factor, if they stay at the current levels, because we have gone the full cycle. But for this quarter, Q1, Q2, there are a big factor, all the -- everyone needs to be thinking about to build it into your numbers. But to go back and just to talk about it. So billings are a function of the strength of the business and the duration of the contract. So this quarter, we had just under 20-month average duration. As I said, the short-term billings statistic, which would look at the change in the short-term deferred revenue, is -- perhaps a better indicator, 15% U.S. dollar growth, 24% constant currency growth. It's hard to imagine people would have expected much more than that. So -- but I do agree, the consensus number did have some kind of very wide variation of estimates in it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Turits (Analysts)】\nIt looked like a very strong infrastructure quarter. You said 19% constant currency, up from 17%. I'm not sure if that included the $5 million or not and how that was related there. But either way, it was very strong. So I was wondering, a, can you tell me, one, if it was adjusted for that $5 million, that 19%? And then also, some of the drivers were there. Are you getting any benefit out of the Windows Server upgrade cycle? Anything in RHEL 7? What are the drivers behind that infrastructure number and how sustainable?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nThanks. It's a good question. And yes, as I said in my prepared remarks, I did include it. So I would back out about 1% to take the adjustment out of there.\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nOn total, but on infrastructure, it's probably a couple percent.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nIt may be 2%. Actually, you're right. It's about 2% on infrastructure. So perhaps 17%, if you back that out, still a very robust performance for the infrastructure segment. Frankly, I'm going to go through, at Analyst Day, the drivers. I don't want to ruin all of my stuff for Analyst Day. But one thing we know for certain is new workloads -- newer workloads are going to Linux. IDC statistics that I shared last year are slightly different, but overall, basically the same. That was showing a 14% shift from legacy operating systems to Linux and -- over a 5-year period of time. And we think we are going to be the primary beneficiary of that. So to me, that's one of the largest drivers. It's newer workloads. It's people wanting to be in an open hybrid cloud environment so they can easily move workloads back and forth from their own data center to multiple different public clouds or in a virtual environment, on bare metal, many different formats. But I would say, all the same drivers we've been talking about over the years still exist, that maybe a new driver is the broadened portfolio of products that we have, I believe, is now an additional driver to our RHEL business. People want to be on our operating system so they can use our other technologies.\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nJust one other comment. I would say, security is also helping. A heightened sense of security, awareness and concern at the board level certainly helps drive Free to Pay as well.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sitikantha Panigrahi (Analysts)】\nI just want to dig in to the others segment that's application development and emerging segment. That had a strong quarter, 44% constant currency growth. Just wondering if you could give some color in terms of any strength you have seen in any particular product, such as like Storage or OpenShift in this quarter. And also, sorry if I missed, do you have any number in terms of OpenStack or Storage component in your top 30 deals?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nSure. I can share some of that. So first of all, I think one of the key drivers here is the significant improvement that we've made in our sales effort in terms of cross-selling. I think as Jim said, 70% of the top deals had an element of application development and emerging technologies in them. There was also a subset that was just the emerging technologies. I think some of the specifics, I think of the top 30 deals, 3 of them this quarter included OpenStack, a couple included OpenShift. We're still doing extremely well with Middleware. Even though the Middleware market is growing probably single-digit percent, we're growing very rapidly at a much faster pace. So we're clearly taking share there. But I think the bottom line here is we're doing a much better job in cross-selling. Our customers are -- many of them buying the entire portfolio.\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nYes, I would just add. On the numbers, you talked about, obviously, revenue numbers. And so we're seeing solid growth across the board. I'd say, in particular, some of our higher value-added Middleware, things like Fuse and Integration, things like SOA, are doing extremely well. Storage continues to grow off of a still small base but grow extremely rapidly. And certainly, the new products are growing -- the OpenShift, et cetera, are growing really, really fast. So solid across the board in that whole set of products that continue to grow double, up to some triple digit kind of growth numbers on some of those.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Brian White (Analysts)】\nYes, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about how Red Hat is partnering with some of the telecom equipment vendors as it relates to NFV and the need for OpenStack. It seems to me that maybe is a little further along than the enterprise. But if you could just give us some color on what you're doing there. And where are -- where is telecom versus enterprise in your view right now?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nWell, I would certainly say, telecom is further along in thinking about OpenStack as it relates to their operating side of the business, which is great to see. We're actively engaged both with -- in customer telcos as well as the equipment providers. We've made announcements with Alcatel-Lucent and with Huawei and, I believe, others. What I would say is next week, when we're together, we can go into more detail, when Paul Cormier is there, can go into more detail at Summit on that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Steven Ashley (Analysts)】\nI'd like to have an OpenStack question for Jim, and it just relates to customers that are vSphere customers. They're going to have the opportunity to -- if they want on vSphere under Red Hat OpenStack or under the new VMware OpenStack. Why would a vSphere customer choose Red Hat OpenStack over VMware? And then just a quick question, Charlie. Was there any impact to deferred revenue on the earned revenue adjustment?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nI'll answer the first part, and Charlie can do the second. Well, first off, VMware's support of OpenStack, we're happy to compete against that any day. We are a significant contributor, and we're all in around OpenStack. It's not an afterthought or a defense move to try to protect the core. And so, I think for a lot of companies that are looking to move away from expensive proprietary lock-in, doubling down with an expensive proprietary company, probably doesn't make the most sense there. And so we have not -- and it's early days, admittedly, but we have not seen a whole lot of interest at least from the customers I've talked to around the VMware OpenStack solution. Again, it's -- it does not behoove them to get people to use that relative to their core. And again, we actually look at offering ability to support open source projects, ecosystem, et cetera. We think we have a huge differentiated value proposition not only versus VMware but, really, against anyone else offering OpenStack product.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nSteve, on the second part of your question, the CCP revenue adjustment had no impact on deferred revenue.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Karl Keirstead (Analysts)】\nOne for Jim, one for Charlie. Jim, one of the trends that's impressing me these days is the ramp in enterprise adoption of open source infrastructure. I'm continually alarmed by its terrific tailwind for you guys. At the same time though, Red Hat still gets roughly 85% of your subscription mix from the core RHEL infrastructure. And I'm just wondering, as you see enterprise adoption of open source ramp, how that changes your predilection to expand Red Hat suite and take advantage of that broader adoption curve. And then for Charlie, if the CCP true-up of $5 million is for 1 month, could we assume then that your annualized cloud subscription bookings must be $60 million?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nAll right. Well, look, I mean, I think we said that on a constant currency basis, our non--RHEL business grew at 44%. So clearly, our other offerings are growing quite rapidly. We've continued to add offerings. Over the last several years, we've made a couple of acquisitions in software-defined storage. We've entered the PaaS market. And more recently, in the past 12 months, we've bought a company called FeedHenry and have entered the mobile back-end business. And so we do continue to add, and we continue to look for opportunities to add. We -- I think you rightly pointed out, open source is becoming more mainstream and considered more innovative in our customers' minds. That means that we have a very opportunity-rich environment because we are seen as the leading trusted open source company. For us, it's a matter of how fast we can invest, how much we can kind of bite off. In the product categories we're in, there's more than a $50 billion total addressable market. So we need to continue to execute taking share in those categories, but we'll certainly continue to look to add other categories in the future.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nOn the second part of the question, relative to the true-up, I guess, my comment would be, I wouldn't make any assumptions about what it means on the run rate. I would revert back to my comment. I believe that during this year and maybe by the end of this year, we will be at a $100 million run rate, but we'll call that out when we get there.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matthew Hedberg (Analysts)】\nCan you give us a sense for what percentage of your customers have migrated to RHEL 7? I know there isn't a specific price increase for that release, but do you generally see ASPs increase through cross-selling upon this migration? Or is the benefit you're seeing from some of these cross-sell just due to the natural cadence and maturity of some of these emerging businesses?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nAbout 50% of our customers are using RHEL 7 to some extent. That doesn't mean they're totally using it, but they're using it in some ways. Recognize, that's heavily driven by when they are migrating applications. Typically, once you have something on an OS, you don't want to move it. So a lot of that has to do with just how much churn they have in their own application portfolio. In terms of does that drive cross-sell, I think a lot of the strength that we're seeing in the other product category is those products are maturing. So things like our -- on the Middleware side, integration or business rules in those things. We've kind of gone from having good products to having truly great products that are still dramatically cheaper than competitors. And so I do think we're just seeing our own product suite maturing in combination with -- CIOs really have gone, I think, in the last several years from thinking of open source as okay technology that's really cheap to kind of really owning a mind space around innovation more and more. And that just certainly helps because it's easier to have a conversation about new products when you're in that kind of mind quadrant of the CIO that this is a strategic vendor that also delivers innovative product.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Abhey Lamba (Analysts)】\nCharlie, largely, metrics are extremely strong, and currency seems to be a slight tailwind versus the last call. And you just beat revenues in the quarter even after adjusting for the CCP adjustment. So why not raise full year revenue outlook by the corresponding amount? What are you seeing that's making you cautious for rest of the year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nI guess, the only thing I can say about that is look at my history of setting guidance. And relative to the actual performance of the last 11 years, I have set this guidance with the same kind of a standard that I've done historically. I don't have any real concerns over the rest of the year. I think Jim and I both said, we think Q1 was a strong start, and it's progressing well. So that's probably all I have to say on that topic, I think.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Tyler Radke (Analysts)】\nThis is actually Tyler Radke on for Walter. I had a question. With the customers you're seeing traction on the OpenStack side, what type of uplift are you getting on servers?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nIs your question on -- you can say, on servers. Do you mean on a number of RHEL subscriptions, the base operating system?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Tyler Radke (Analysts)】\nCorrect, yes. Yes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nOur RHEL OpenStack product is actually a bundle, which includes RHEL and OpenStack. It's all 1 product. So it's kind of 1 for 1. But it's entirely possible that, as I said before, people getting ready to go OpenStack may be adopting RHEL faster to move the operating systems in their data centers in our direction. I mean, that could be a byproduct. But basically, when we sell a subscription for OpenStack, it's bundled with RHEL.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kash Rangan (Analysts)】\nA quick update on the CFO search. And secondly, when you look at OpenStack, just as a conceptual idea, back during the days when Red Hat was a small company, Linux was displacing Unix and there was a replacement cycle targeted very expensive legacy systems. So you had the bad guys to target, and you are the good guys. And you were the savior of corporate IT department. When you look at OpenStack, it feels like that same argument does not apply. And Red Hat is now a bigger company. You've got more enemies. You had a lot of friends back those days, that's actually a good thing. And it's not a replacement market, it's a market where there's a lot of new innovation. So conceptually, how does Red Hat exploit -- well, how much of your background is becoming the open source Linux operating system dominant provider does actually apply in this new OpenStack core?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nYes. Sure. Well, so first off, on your first question, we do hope to have an update for you on the search at Analyst Day next week. So please join us then and I hope to have an update for you at that time. In terms of OpenStack, I do think you point out some differences in kind of market. I actually look at all of those as quite a positive thing for Red Hat because we've already established ourselves as a significant vendor to most large enterprise IT. We're a core part of their production ecosystem. So we're strategic for that reason, and we are now offering more innovative product. So we have a seat at the table, and we can talk about innovation. And those 2 things together really do make us very strategic. It also kind of opens up the size of market opportunity. So when you're going in there commoditizing a market, the size of the market is the market that currently exists and you then price underneath that umbrella. But it's a logical market size. With our newer, more innovative products, whether it's OpenStack or OpenShift or some of our mobile technologies, the size of the market is limited by the business opportunities created by those technologies. So it gives us a much greater ability to kind of come in and talk about the value of those things rather than just the cost savings, which admittedly is a more complex sell. And so one of the reasons you've heard us talk over the last, really, 2 years about investments in sales and marketing is that they are longer sales cycles. But the ultimate results are deeper relationships at a higher level in the organization and larger contracts, which I think you've seen us continue to deliver. I think if it hadn't been for Linux and we were coming in brand-new to this, it would be really hard to have that same level of mind share with the CIO. But because we're there, we have it. And secondly, especially, and this is particularly to OpenStack, which you asked about, the certified ecosystem of hardware providers and management tool vendors that we have kind of carry over from RHEL into OpenStack, right? So -- and which gives us just an incremental benefit as well.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gregg Moskowitz (Analysts)】\nJim, haven't heard any commentary on RHEV yet. Just wondering how that's been performing. And then secondly, realizing that we're only a few months in, what has the customer response to RHEL Atomic Host been like so far?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nWell, I would say, RHEV, that is actually bundled into the infrastructure group. So we don't break out any detail there. In general, I think we've all been surprised at how well it's done over the last, really, year, not just this quarter. As just I think as people are starting to use more Red Hat technologies, they picked it up. Obviously, we've been focusing hard on OpenStack, but it seems to be driving solid performance on the RHEV side. Second part?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gregg Moskowitz (Analysts)】\nContainers [indiscernible] in Atomic.\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nYes, containers. It's too early to have kind of significant sales around RHEL Atomic. We're getting phenomenal interest. And the level of engagement in general we're getting around containers with our customers is huge. And that's both on the RHEL side and on the OpenShift side. So what I would say is come to Analyst Day next week and you'll hear a lot more about what we're doing as well as the traction that, that's getting us with customers.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Katherine Egbert (Analysts)】\nJust a question on the growth rates. For a long time, you talked about being sort of a mid-teens to high-teens grower, and that seemed a good rate for RHEL. But you've clearly, for the last few quarters at least, been exceeding 20%. And it looks like that's coming from upsell of some of the emerging products. Can you talk about what is sort of a more natural growth rate? And then the second part is, given that the growth is doing quite well, why aren't we seeing a bit more leverage, particularly in the operating margin?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nHeather, on -- I mean...\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nKatherine.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nKatherine, sorry. Katherine, on the longer-term goal, it's been our philosophy not to talk about goals beyond the year. But you rightly point out that the performance over the last 4 quarters, maybe 5 quarters now, has been pretty stellar. And I think going back to last year's Analyst Day, when we first begin breaking out the 2 product groupings, I mean, it was an interesting revelation that the operating system side or the infrastructure-related side has performed very solidly, sort of mid-teens. And of course, the other part was that the emerging products group is growing at a much, much faster pace. We have not published any longer-term goals, so I don't think it's appropriate at this point to talk about it. But we are going to talk about some things in more depth next week at the Analyst Day, including some of the drivers, and so that's probably a point where maybe you can get some more detail on that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nAnd on margin, as we continued to say, we have a huge opportunity out there, and we are investing into it. These are large markets that make us very, very strategic. But as I said earlier, they have longer sales cycles. And so as we've generated stronger performance, we -- it's allowed us to invest more in sales and marketing, which we get that strong performance. So we do believe, as we've said for a long time, we think there's a lot of scale in the business. But right now, we have such a large opportunity to grow and establish ourselves as the leader in these categories, that we continue to do that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nKatherine, I'll have a little bit more detail on the margin since I'm benchmarking it in my prepared remarks for Analyst Day, so we'll see you there.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Wood (Analysts)】\nThe Platform-as-a-Service, you finally bust it up in terms of adoption [indiscernible] kind of some of [indiscernible].\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nDerrick, your phone line is breaking up. I think I heard Platform-as-a-Service, but past that, try again.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Wood (Analysts)】\nOkay. I was saying that it seems to be bubbling up a little bit more in terms of adoption. I'm just hoping to get some kind of use cases that you're seeing out there on the OpenShift platform. And I know you've got version 3 coming out later this year. Curious how you think about that in terms of driving adoption. And then a follow-up for Charlie. The revenue guidance, I'm just wondering if you could quantify the foreign currency impact assumed in your revenue guidance.\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nYes. Well, I'll start off. Well, first off, I'd encourage you to come to Summit next week. We have Barclays, Blue Cross, Blue Shield, VA [ph], Citi and DreamWorks, all presenting on their use of OpenShift. As you said, the version 3 has gotten tremendous interest really because of containers. People are looking for a production platform to run containers. And right now, while not GA-ed, version 3, which is -- supports Docker and Kubernetes or provides Docker and Kubernetes in a supported way, is something that's getting a lot of enterprises very excited. So I do think as that marches forward, that will be an additional driver. Both a differentiator versus other offerings, but certainly a driver of growth for OpenShift.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nOn the revenue guidance, in terms of the rates I've used, what I said was that the euro is a little stronger, the yen is a little bit weaker, but the overall basket of currencies is about the same as it was when I set the original guidance. So there's no incremental currency impact compared to what I did in -- at the start of the year in the guidance I just gave. So what you should take away is -- the key thing I think is I have high confidence in the top of the range, which is $2.20 billion.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Edward Maguire (Analysts)】\nFrom time to time, you've talked about your embedded business, and I was wondering if you could characterize at least qualitatively if not quantitatively the impact that it's having both on infrastructure as well as some of the emerging technologies.\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nWell, at this point, we don't break it out. It actually -- the SKUs actually split across that because there's obviously the RHEL component, which is in infrastructure, and there's the messaging application platform kind of component stuff that sits in the other business unit. So it's spread right now across both. I think we have a really nice opportunity there. We are beginning to invest more in the area. It's not to the point of something I could really break out. We've always had a degree of it in our business. But we continue to see more opportunities that are working with more of our customers on it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: S. Kirk Materne (Analysts)】\nCharlie, I was just wondering, when you think about investments -- I imagine you're going to get into this a little bit next week. But you guys obviously have a much broader product portfolio today than you did a few years ago. So you spend a lot on R&D. Just from a go-to-market perspective, I guess, what's the thought process on broadening your own direct sales force to take advantage of this, to really push harder, since we're at the very early stages of adoption of OpenStack, just to make sure that you guys are talking to. Now, I guess, the question is, do you have enough feet on the street from a direct perspective? I assume some of the investment you're embedding is around that, but I was just curious if that's going to be sort of escalating over the next 12 months perhaps.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nGreat, Kirk. First of all, last but not least, we're glad that you got on the call. So as we've said, really, for the last several years, we're investing for growth. And I think you can see the benefit of it in the cross-sell activity that's really starting to take off here. We've added a lot to sales and marketing over that period of time. And we have explained to the buy side that when you have this kind of a growth opportunity, you need to keep investing because you need to get the share while you can get it. And we are still trying to hire salespeople pretty much as fast as we can go. And we have some specialties that probably in higher demand than others, but we're adding to sales and engineering this year. We've got an aggressive recruiting schedule. At the Vancouver OpenStack Summit, for example, we had a special team of recruiters on site and looking for OpenStack professionals. And so if you all know of some of those, refer them our way. But I think the sales recruiting in this -- and what we've done in building our sales is really showing up now in what you're seeing in the emerging products growth statistics. And so we will keep doing that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tom McCallum (Executives)】\nEveryone, this now concludes the first quarter earnings call, and we look forward to seeing many of you next week at Summit.

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you, Laura. Good morning, and thank you for joining us.\r\nBefore we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially.\r\nA detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information.\r\nBoth our first quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. \r\nAfter our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Cindy, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. With me to review Kroger's first quarter 2015 results are Mike Ellis, Kroger's President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Schlotman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\r\nKroger delivered strong first quarter sales and earnings results, and we are pleased with our start for the year. We achieved our 46th consecutive quarter of positive identical supermarket sales growth. We exceeded our goal to slightly expand FIFO operating margin without fuel on a rolling 4-quarter basis, and we continue to invest and innovate to grow our business, expanding our use of technology and our digital capabilities. \r\nKroger has produced consistently remarkable results for so long that it might be easy to take a quarter like this for granted, but these results don't happen accidentally. They happen because we lead and drive our business toward these goals. Customer 1st and our 4 keys: our people, products, shopping experience and pricing, remains our fundamental strategy. We strive for balance across these 4 keys, and each quarter, we do a little better in each. And when we do that consistently for as long as we have, our results are more powerful. \r\nBased on the strength of our first quarter results, we are raising our identical supermarket sales growth guidance for the year, and we are on track to deliver our long-term net earnings per diluted share growth rate of 8% to 11%, plus the dividend, in 2015. One of the ways we continuously improve the shopping experience is by bringing new technology and digital capabilities to our business. Mike Ellis will provide an update on several digital efforts in a moment, but I wanted to mention what I think is a great example of how we're expanding our use of technology. \r\nOur recent decision to establish 84.51°, which replaced our previous joint venture, dunnhumbyUSA, 84.51° is helping us to continue to use data science for the benefit of our customers and to deliver a more personalized experience, both in store and online. We are so excited to welcome the talented associates at 84.51° to the Kroger team, and we are already beginning to see their daily involvement in the business helping to accelerate our efforts. \r\nJust little things, like 84.51° CEO Stuart Aitken participating in our senior officer meetings is making a big difference. We expect 84.51° to be an innovation engine and a game changer for Kroger and our customers. We are pleased to see the economy moving in the right direction, albeit as we've mentioned for several quarters, slowly. \r\nOne of the important ways we are able to deliver so consistently is that we offer attractive values for all customers all the time. When you want to splurge, you can splurge. When you want to save, you can do that, too. So while Murray's Cheese, Starbucks and Boar's Head, for example, are performing very well, so are our entry-level price point brands. \r\nNow I will turn it over to Mike Ellis to outline our operational performance. Mike?\n\n---\n\nThank you, Rodney. Good morning, everyone. Our associates continue to deliver an exceptional experience in ways that make a difference for our customers. Over the past year, more customers have noticed improvements in Kroger's product selection, product freshness and customer service. Our strong identical supermarket sales growth was primarily driven by an increase in the number of households shopping with us in the first quarter. We also met our goal to grow the number of loyal households at even a faster rate than total household growth again in the quarter. \r\nWe're especially proud of our loyalty and sales results when you consider the current operating environment that we're in, which has less certainty than normal. We are addressing the volatility we see out there every day. Fuel margins, for example, have returned to normal compared to where we ended last year. \r\nAnother factor is product costs. Some commodities are up, some are down. We are seeing deflation in milk, produce and seafood, which is driving more tonnage volume. Milk is one of our most price-elastic categories that we have. When milk prices come down, people tend to buy a lot more. We're at an advantage because we have a vertically integrated supply chain for milk. When our dairy plants run at higher volume, we become more efficient and productive. \r\nWe continue to see inflation in generic pharmaceuticals and in certain commodities in the meat department. Overall, inflation continued, but at a lower rate during the first quarter, which is in line with what we had expected. \r\nTonnage growth was very strong during the first quarter. In fact, we saw the strongest first quarter tonnage performance since 2010, which is a clear indication of our ability to get pricing right for our customers. If you look back over the past several years, we've had periods of high and low inflation, and we've shown that regardless of the environment, we will deliver greater value and convenience for our customers. \r\nCorporate Brands had a solid first quarter, accelerating company sales growth and representing approximately 26.9% of total units sold and 25.4% of sales dollars, excluding fuel and pharmacy. A key driver of sustainable growth is Customer 1st innovation, and as Rodney said, we are actively expanding Kroger's use of technology, which we see as a catalyst for improving our connection with customers and growing our market share. \r\nKroger's digital team has developed a popular mobile app that our customers use millions of times each week. In April, we were one of the first food retailers to release an app that is compatible with the Apple Watch. And this month, we reached a new milestone, more than 2 billion digital coupons have been downloaded from our digital properties since we began offering digital coupons in 2009. It took 4 years to reach our first billion and only 15 months to reach our second billion, and the third billion will take even less time. \r\nAlso this month, our Cincinnati division began inviting local customers to try our order online, pick up at the store solution we are learning from Harris Teeter, which we have been beta testing for a few months and is now available in 2 of our Cincinnati area stores to all customers. \r\nOur integration with Vitacost.com continues to go very well, and just this week, Vitacost helped us launch a new natural and organic e-commerce website called King Soopers Live Naturally that is open to King Soopers customers who live in and around the Denver Metro area. The website, which utilizes Vitacost's technology platform and fulfillment network, creates an endless aisle experience with ship-to-home service for thousands of additional health foods, vitamins, minerals and supplements that are available in our Denver area stores today. We are excited to see the results of this new pilot program.\r\n  \r\nAnd now I will provide a brief update on labor relations. We recently agreed to new contracts in both Las Vegas and Louisville, and we agreed to a Master Agreement with the Teamsters covering several distribution and manufacturing facilities. Four of the 5 Teamster locals have also ratified this agreement. We are currently negotiating contracts with the UFCW for store associates in Columbus, Denver, Memphis and Portland. \r\nOur objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. \r\nKroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger and the local unions which represent many of our associates should have a shared objective: growing Kroger's business, and profitably, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates. \r\nBefore I turn it over to Mike Schlotman, I'd like to say a little more about the culture of opportunity we work hard to create here at Kroger. Being a Kroger associate means being part of our family, part of something bigger. Every day, we hire people who come to Kroger for a job, then decide to stay for a career. In fact, 2/3 of our store managers today started as an hourly clerk, stocking shelves or bagging groceries. We continue to increase our investment in training to build skills so our associates are ready for opportunities to advance and lead others. We offer so much more than a job, a chance to connect with their community, to be part of a giant team stretching from coast to coast and to work with colleagues who want to make a difference, too. We think this opportunity culture is a differentiator for us today and will continue to be into the future. \r\nNow Mike Schlotman will offer more detail on Kroger's financial results and update our guidance for 2015. Mike?\n\n---\n\nThanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our results for the quarter in each of the key performance target areas for our long-term growth plan. \r\nOur first metric is identical supermarket sales without fuel. We are pleased with our first quarter identical supermarket sales growth of 5.7%. This strong performance was supported by identical supermarket sales growth in every department and every supermarket division. We continue to see outstanding double-digit identical sales growth in our natural foods department. Our meat, deli and pharmacy departments also posted strong identical supermarket sales growth. \r\nRolling 4 quarters FIFO operating margin, excluding fuel, the 2014 and 2013 adjustment items and the contributions to the pension and foundation in the third and fourth quarters of 2014 increased by 10 basis points. This exceeded our commitment to grow the rate slightly over time on a rolling 4 quarters basis. \r\nReturn on invested capital on a rolling 4 quarters basis was 14.03%. We are not presenting a comparative number this quarter because the prior year first quarter calculation does not include a full year of Harris Teeter assets and results. We do expect return on invested capital for fiscal 2015 to increase slightly from the fiscal 2014 result. This is an important metric as we continue to increase our capital investment to drive our future growth. \r\nNow I'll share our first quarter 2015 results in more detail. As you know, we don't provide guidance for total sales because of the unpredictability of fuel margins on our results. \r\nTotal sales in the first quarter increased 0.3% to $33.1 billion compared to $33 billion for the same period last year. Excluding fuel, total sales increased 6.4% for the first quarter compared to the same period last year. \r\nIn the first quarter, our net earnings totaled $619 million or $1.25 per diluted share. Kroger's net earnings during the first quarter last year included charges related to the restructuring of certain pension obligations to help save -- stabilize associates' future benefits. Excluding the effect of those charges, Kroger's adjusted net earnings in the same period last year were $557 million or $1.09 per diluted share. \r\nWe recorded a $28 million LIFO charge during the first quarter, consistent with the same quarter last year. We raised our annual estimate to $90 million from $75 million, primarily due to pharmacy inflation. \r\nFIFO gross margin, excluding retail fuel operations, decreased 7 basis points from the same period last year. Strong identical supermarket sales growth and cost control has allowed Kroger to leverage operating expenses as a rate of sales in the first quarter. \r\nTotal operating expenses, excluding retail fuel operations and pension agreements, decreased 15 basis points as a result of sales compared to the prior year. This really does demonstrate the leverage of strong ID sales as we simultaneously invested in areas other than price to provide a continually improving shopping experience for our customers, but leveraged our ID sales to drive the rate down. \r\nNow for retail fuel operations. In the first quarter, our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.116 compared to $0.131 in the same quarter last year. Our long-term financial strategy continues to be repurchase shares, have an increasing dividend, fund increasing capital investments and maintain our current investment grade debt rating. \r\nOur strong financial position has allowed us to return $1.1 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends over the last 4 quarters. During the quarter, Kroger repurchased 8 million common shares for a total investment of $585 million. \r\nCapital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, totaled $915 million for the first quarter compared to $709 million for the same period last year. We continue to expect capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, to be in the $3 billion to $3.3 billion range for the year. \r\nOur planned increased capital investment on an annual basis remains in place. We are pleased with the early returns from these investments, and we continue to have a long list of strong projects that will compete for these investments. \r\nThe company's net total debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio decreased to 2.09 compared to 2.40 during the same period last year. Kroger's net total debt is $11.3 billion consistent with last year. \r\nIt's constructive to understand that we have maintained our absolute debt level while returning $1.1 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends over the last 4 quarters and investing $3 billion in capital on a rolling 4-quarter basis, plus an additional $411 million on mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities. \r\nIn other words, we're keeping our commitments to our bondholders and our shareholders. Now I'd like to update our growth objectives for 2015. Based on our strong first quarter results, we raised our identical supermarket sales growth guidance, excluding fuel, to a range of 3.5% to 4.5% for 2015. The original guidance was 3% to 4%. We're confirming our net earnings guidance range of $3.80 to $3.90 per diluted share for 2015. This range is within our long-term net earnings per diluted share growth guidance of 8% to 11%. Shareholder return will be further enhanced by a dividend expected to increase over time. \r\nAs we look at quarter comparisons in relation to our 8% to 11% annual growth rate, we believe that quarter 2 will be slightly above the range, quarter 3 will be at the high end of the range and quarter 4 will be below the range. For the full year, we expect to be within the range, and it is still somewhat dependent on where fuel margins shake out. \r\nNow I will turn it back to Rodney.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Mike. This is another terrific quarter. Our associates are making a difference for our customers by providing excellent service and product quality and selection. As I said earlier, results like this don't happen by accident. We create these results by connecting with our customers through our powerful Customer 1st Strategy. When we take care of our customers, we create sustainable value for our shareholders. \r\nNow we look forward to your questions.",

Excluding fuel, total sales increased 6.4% for the first quarter compared to the same period last year. \r\nIn the first quarter, our net earnings totaled $619 million or $1.25 per diluted share. Kroger's net earnings during the first quarter last year included charges related to the restructuring of certain pension obligations to help save -- stabilize associates' future benefits. Excluding the effect of those charges, Kroger's adjusted net earnings in the same period last year were $557 million or $1.09 per diluted share. \r\nWe recorded a $28 million LIFO charge during the first quarter, consistent with the same quarter last year. We raised our annual estimate to $90 million from $75 million, primarily due to pharmacy inflation. \r\nFIFO gross margin, excluding retail fuel operations, decreased 7 basis points from the same period last year. Strong identical supermarket sales growth and cost control has allowed Kroger to leverage operating expenses as a rate of sales in the first quarter. \r\nTotal operating expenses, excluding retail fuel operations and pension agreements, decreased 15 basis points as a result of sales compared to the prior year. This really does demonstrate the leverage of strong ID sales as we simultaneously invested in areas other than price to provide a continually improving shopping experience for our customers, but leveraged our ID sales to drive the rate down. \r\nNow for retail fuel operations. In the first quarter, our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.116 compared to $0.131 in the same quarter last year. Our long-term financial strategy continues to be repurchase shares, have an increasing dividend, fund increasing capital investments and maintain our current investment grade debt rating. \r\nOur strong financial position has allowed us to return $1.1 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends over the last 4 quarters. During the quarter, Kroger repurchased 8 million common shares for a total investment of $585 million. \r\nCapital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, totaled $915 million for the first quarter compared to $709 million for the same period last year. We continue to expect capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, to be in the $3 billion to $3.3 billion range for the year. \r\nOur planned increased capital investment on an annual basis remains in place. We are pleased with the early returns from these investments, and we continue to have a long list of strong projects that will compete for these investments. \r\nThe company's net total debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio decreased to 2.09 compared to 2.40 during the same period last year. Kroger's net total debt is $11.3 billion consistent with last year. \r\nIt's constructive to understand that we have maintained our absolute debt level while returning $1.1 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends over the last 4 quarters and investing $3 billion in capital on a rolling 4-quarter basis, plus an additional $411 million on mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities. \r\nIn other words, we're keeping our commitments to our bondholders and our shareholders. Now I'd like to update our growth objectives for 2015. Based on our strong first quarter results, we raised our identical supermarket sales growth guidance, excluding fuel, to a range of 3.5% to 4.5% for 2015. The original guidance was 3% to 4%. We're confirming our net earnings guidance range of $3.80 to $3.90 per diluted share for 2015. This range is within our long-term net earnings per diluted share growth guidance of 8% to 11%. Shareholder return will be further enhanced by a dividend expected to increase over time. \r\nAs we look at quarter comparisons in relation to our 8% to 11% annual growth rate, we believe that quarter 2 will be slightly above the range, quarter 3 will be at the high end of the range and quarter 4 will be below the range. For the full year, we expect to be within the range, and it is still somewhat dependent on where fuel margins shake out. \r\nNow I will turn it back to Rodney.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nThanks, Mike. This is another terrific quarter. Our associates are making a difference for our customers by providing excellent service and product quality and selection. As I said earlier, results like this don't happen by accident. We create these results by connecting with our customers through our powerful Customer 1st Strategy. When we take care of our customers, we create sustainable value for our shareholders. \r\nNow we look forward to your questions.",
      "transcript_text3": "So my first question, I guess, is just related to the guidance. So I guess, maybe more for Mike, but you obviously raised your ID guidance for the year. You had a good, strong quarter but you maintained the EPS guidance. So I'm just kind of curious, at this point, is it just early and you want to be conservative? Or are there other incremental offsets that are maybe new?\n\n---\n\nIt's a variety of factors, Ed, and one, it is early in the year. And as we said in both the release and in the prepared comments, the operating environment's a bit volatile right now. There's a lot of volatility in fuel prices. They've obviously come in very quickly to a more normal range from where the range was at the end of the year last year. We know that will be a headwind in the fourth quarter. It was baked into our original 8% to 11%. Our actual first quarter results, while ahead of The Street, were just a little bit over the 8% to 11% range, and we had expected to be the near the high end of the range ourselves, which was our original guidance on cadence. And then just the volatility of inflation that's out there. While we've seen some categories with deflation, we know that pharmacy inflation is actually as high as it's been over the last several years. In the first quarter, it's right at double digits. And then a little bit of concern or thought process about the avian virus with the poultry flocks and how that might affect input costs later in the year and what's going to happen with availability of those products. So when we stepped back and thought about it, while we're pleased with the first quarter, we thought the most prudent move given the uncertainty -- or the volatility of some of the things out there was to maintain our guidance range. We had guided in March that if fuel margins came in, it may put us at the low end. We aren't saying we're going to be at the low end, but we're maintaining the range because that actually has happened with fuel.\n\n---\n\nAnd Mike, historically, you've kind of said about $0.14 or so a gallon in fuel. Obviously, this quarter's lower, but kind of like the slope of the curve was rising. Is there anything else that's changed in the marketplace or maybe it's become a bit more competitive, where you're a little concerned about the $0.14?\n\n---\n\nI -- we -- I wouldn't say we've focused on any one number. Our practice on fuel is to follow the market, and then give our most loyal customers a really good value on fuel by the -- our fuel rewards program, which I'll remind everybody the cost of that reduces our ID sales, it doesn't reduce the fuel margin. And it's really just what's happening in the marketplace as we follow the marketplace and stay right on The Street price and the signs but then give that incremental reward. I wouldn't say there's anything unusual in the first quarter. Any short period of time in fuel is an interesting result but a longer period of time is what's more important.\n\n---\n\nAnd we -- internally, we usually use a rolling 4-quarter number. This year, we didn't just because of how strong fuel margins were in the third and fourth quarter. And as Mike mentioned, on a daily basis, we're probably never right, but usually over the year, it gets pretty close.\n\n---\n\nSo I just wanted to follow up a little more just on inflation. For this upcoming year, have you guys changed your inflation forecast?\n\n---\n\nYes, we're still expecting it to be in the 1% to 2% range. We're actually at the high end of that range in the first quarter, a lot of that driven by the pharmaceutical inflation that Mike mentioned -- or we mentioned in the prepared comments, primarily in the generic arena. So that's out there. We do expect to see some potential inflation out there in the poultry flocks as the avian flu issue hits. We don't know what's going to happen with all of the input ingredients that go into products from liquid eggs and how that might affect a lot of products that contain that as an ingredient. So we think that 1% to 2% is right. So far, that's what we're seeing.\n\n---\n\nOkay, thanks for the color. And then switching topics, maybe to your competition. We hear a lot about capacity growth in the specialty grocery arena and even some -- even I guess, more commentary out there on the hard discount channel. What are you seeing right now from competitor openings in, I guess, from a full-service grocery perspective?\n\n---\n\nWell, from a full service, I guess, I would say it's probably been pretty consistent over the last 3 or 4 years. Not -- certainly not aggressive. Certainly, if you look at the niche merchants, there would be much higher growth there, but we consider everybody a competitor. So we don't -- we wouldn't segment it as different as what probably most people would think we would.\n\n---\n\nSo I'm just curious on, well, maybe this is just semantics, Mike, and maybe I'm overreading, but just to clarify on your guidance by quarter, you said just now that 3Q, you expect it to be at the high end of your guidance? I think last quarter you said it would be slightly above?\n\n---\n\nYes, if you look at second and third quarter, actually I think second quarter we said at high end and third quarter above. We just flip flopped those a little bit. It takes $8 million flipping between quarters to do that, and it's just our best thinking today. So it doesn't affect the year. I think if you look back to what we just said in March, the guidance on those 2 quarters just flipped between quarters. We still expect a very strong year.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then on tonnage, I don't know if you guys would be willing to give an actual percent tonnage number. And then, I guess, following on that, I guess, when I look at O&A, your O&A growth rate definitely seemed higher than what I would have expected. I know in the past, we -- you talked about tonnage impacting that number, but maybe just some color on those 2.\n\n---\n\nYes, relative to tonnage, we won't give an actual number. As Mike said in his prepared comments, it was the strongest we've had since 2010, and we haven't given a specific number, but we're very pleased with where it is. If you think about in the comments I made on OG&A, we're very pleased with the leverage we've got of 15 basis point reduction in that as a rate of sales. We did make conscious decisions to invest in other keys of our 4 key strategy versus price to provide a better shopping experience to our customers, both through making sure the products are on the shelves in a timely basis, having our associates friendly and we keep our products as fresh as possible. So there was some conscious decision to invest in incremental services for our customers, which provides more jobs and hours for our associates as well.\n\n---\n\nThe other thing on tonnage, we always try to give an outline of where we are and how it feels, but it's very hard to calculate. And when a customer buys a 24 unit of something versus a 12 unit of something in our -- internally, we count that as one and one.\n\n---\n\nOr water, the common package for bottled water today is 32 bottles. It used to be 24. That's still a unit.\n\n---\n\nIt's not that we're trying to avoid the question. It's just that it's -- there's an awful lot of assumptions behind that, and what we try to do is give everybody a general feel for what's going on.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then just on the ClickList, I guess, in Cincinnati. I mean, obviously I know you guys are always very conservative and want to make sure your customer is getting the best experience, but it definitely seemed like it was a pretty long test phase. So I guess, maybe can you maybe clarify or give some color on what you ironed out, and what made you feel comfortable to roll it out now, and how quickly you think you could accelerate that?\n\n---\n\nYes, the length of the test would seem long just because it became public a lot faster than we had intended to because somehow, one of the newspaper folks that follow us found the actual website that we were testing with our associates. So it's not that it was longer than normal. It's just that it was public longer than what we normally would. It's tracking -- if you look at our original plan, we're tracking on exactly where we thought we would be on the original plan, and feel good about it. And then Mike just pointed out to me, we just added our second store, I guess it was this week or last week.\n\n---\n\nAnd again that's in a beta test and you kind of have to know it's there. It's a new experience for us, and we just want to make sure it's right.\n\n---\n\nI wanted to ask you first about really the private label, in particular the Simple Truth, if you could just give us a quick update in terms of where that brand is today? If over the first quarter there had been any updates in terms of product expansion and how big that particular segment is for you right now.\n\n---\n\nThe brand, we're very pleased with. I think you'll find around 2,600 SKUs in our stores today and talk about connecting with the customer in a meaningful way. They have taken the brand and really embraced the brand. For us, it's been not only strategic, but it's really lining up with what customers are looking for today. And you can also buy it now on Vitacost.com. And it's available there also, so anybody who -- even if you don't shop in a Kroger market, you're able to get the product today. But no, we've been totally -- completely pleased with the progress we're making, and there are many more new items to come.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then maybe just as a follow-up, sticking with the natural segment, as you're continuing to learn the Vitacost division and as you're -- as you mentioned, you have the Soopers site now up, have you had any further progress? I know it's still admittedly pretty early, but have you had any further progress that you could share with us in terms of maybe bringing some more of those products that had historically been Vitacost into some of your other banners?\n\n---\n\nWell, today, we have a pretty good selection of natural foods, supplements, body building products, health care products in our stores. Vitacost really just helps us fulfill that long tail of items that are smaller in some cases, and on the King Soopers website now, you can pick up 25,000 to 30,000 additional SKUs than what you'd find in a typical Kroger store. So it's really helped us take natural foods, natural products to the customer in a much broader way. We're really pleased with where we're headed. There's a lot of work still to do. We're approaching our first anniversary with Vitacost next month, and so we're actually moving pretty fast as a company and we're pleased with where we're headed.\n\n---\n\nSo Rodney, I want to start with -- you put up a quarter like this, but I know you guys can be somewhat self-critical. When you step back and say, from a skill set standpoint or a business line standpoint, where are you still not where you want to be in a significant way, not we're 90% of the way there but we have a lot of work to do? And then as part of that, address maybe the issue of speed to market and that being a more important skill set to work on over the next couple of years.\n\n---\n\nThe shortest hard question to answer, and when I did my own performance review with our Board, somebody asked the same question. And you've followed Kroger for a long time, and you realize when you look at our culture overall, we're always very proud of what we've accomplished. But at the same time, we feel like we have a tremendous opportunity to get better, and a lot of times, we like to use the words that our to-do list is longer than our done list. And when you look at what's out in front of us, we are incredibly excited about the opportunities that we see to continue to get better. And the hardest thing that we have to do is actually make sure that we're trying not to improve on all things at once, but what are the things that are most important to the customer and put all our resources against that. So I guess that the way I would say overall is obviously, we're delighted with the quarter, delighted with the progress we're making. We're even more excited about the opportunity to continue to get better. So I feel very good about where we are, but I feel even better about the opportunities we have in front of us.\n\n---\n\nBut are there certain -- there have to be, right, certain product categories -- I don't want to get into geographic differences, but certain product categories, businesses, customer groups that you're not fully resonating with yet, it'd have to be those, and what would tie those together, if anything?\n\n---\n\nIt's -- probably I'm trying to think of the easiest way to answer your question because it's a very good question. The -- it's more opportunity. So if you think about like apparel, where you just -- we've added apparel to, I don't know, I think we're up to 70-some marketplace stores. We're still learning what is the right selection of product to have that's in a marketplace store. Obviously, the Fred Meyer Group helps us get insight and procures the product for us through that channel, but we're still learning what's the right things to put in. And there's a ton of those kind of things going on, so it's really hard to say we're -- there's one specific item or one specific customer. It's much broader than that, and it's 100 different things versus just one thing that we're really trying to get better at.\n\n---\n\nAll right. And then just lastly, when you think about pricing, right, and pricing being a journey, it looks to me like, whether it's traditional competitors or mass, there's been some stabilization with regard to pricing, right? It's not a race to the bottom. Is that fair? And at this point, you're largely where you need to be. And the adjustments to come, is it -- do you think it's more kind of rifle -- you sort of look at maybe the hard discounters and work to be done on private label pricing, but are we stable and largely there and it's just selective guys you've got to address at this point?\n\n---\n\nIf you look at longer term on pricing, as you know, over the last several years, we've invested in price as we reduced OG&A to take costs out of the business. The last few quarters, we have been a little more aggressive in investing in service. So it's not just price based. So if you look at the mix of where we invest, we have invested some of that cost reduction in additional service hours and things like that. So it's a journey that you never arrive at a destination, so you're continually making progress, and you continually change based on your competitive -- your competitors change as well. So we're happy where we are, but we are continuing to invest but it's really driven by as we get costs out of the business. I don't know if, Mike, anything you'd want to add to that?\n\n---\n\nNo, I absolutely agree. It's right in sync with the prepared comments we had. And I'll just throw in, when you think about our 4 keys, we're constantly asking ourselves what do we invest in to make sure that we're offering the best balance to the customer based on what the customer wants and the retail environment that we're in. So Rodney's point about investing more in our people in the last few quarters is right on.\n\n---\n\nOne question would just be, real quickly, you talked about where your guidance for inflation was for the year but did you comment on what you thought inflation was for the quarter?\n\n---\n\nWe did not. But Mike...\n\n---\n\nWe're at the high end of that range, primarily driven by Pharmacy. It's about 1/8. If you look at it without Pharmacy, it would have been lower, and the comments we had on a volatile operating environment is -- if you just get rid of the headline news on inflation and you start to dig into the commodities, you have things going all over the world. And one of the things I think we're most proud of this quarter is there were so many things bouncing around, and our ability to manage through that this quarter really showed up in our results.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And then I was wondering if you would talk at all about the formats that you're testing called Ruler. I think you maybe have about 30 stores, and I was just wondering what your thoughts are. And we do know that Aldi is going to be opening more stores in Southern California is getting a big push, and Lidl is also going to be coming to the U.S. pretty soon, just how do you feel about that format? And do you want to be a competitor in that format?\n\n---\n\nWe're still -- it's still very early and it's obviously a test for us. It's one of the things where we feel good about the progress the team made. The format actually came to us through one of our mergers. When we merged with Jay C, they had the format even back then, and the team has made a lot of changes to what's inside of it, and we continue to make changes. I wouldn't say that we're ready for prime time yet, but we are making progress in the right direction. And it really ties back to when you look at -- you've heard us over the years talk a lot about how customers are bifurcating, and we want to make sure that we have a format that serves all customers, and there's certain customers that living on a budget is really important because either they want to or they have to, and it's operating a store as efficient as you can to give the best prices you can. So it really ties to that. I don't know, Mike, anything you want to add to that?\n\n---\n\nJust what we learned from this type of a format has really been helpful to better understand that value segment and how to operate in that value world. So we've really, as a company, learned a lot, I think.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And then just real quickly, I know you said your natural organic department was up double digits. Did you see any changes at all? I think there are some other retailers that have said there was a bit of a slowdown, I think primarily in the dry grocery side, but I don't know, it doesn't sound like you saw anything, but did you?\n\n---\n\nNothing that I can put my finger on. It's still real healthy for us. Again, we have good supplies, so we haven't had any issues around that. But no, customers still are as interested in the natural category, the natural foods world, real food, we call it, as they ever have been.\n\n---\n\nI wanted to follow up on your thinking around the guidance. I think you said the quarter came in slightly above, with fuel, slightly below. So how does that, if we just isolate the stores, does that mean the stores was little better than that versus internal expectations?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think the strong IDs without fuel would demonstrate how happy we are with our core grocery performance, and our -- that's built into our expectations for the year when we raised ID sales guidance without fuel. So we're very pleased with what's going on inside the 4 walls of the store.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And Meredith asked about the, I guess, the cadence on natural, but I'd like to ask about it just on a -- across the store. It sounds like, from your answer and the answer on natural, that there hasn't been a big fall off or some volatility on the consumer side. I think it sounds to me like the worry is more on the supply side, whether it's the fuel margins coming in or what's going to happen with some of the commodities.\n\n---\n\nYes, I'm not sure I understood the last part of the question on the supply side, Andrew.\n\n---\n\nWell, first of all, I want to ask if you're seeing any change in your sales cadence, and is that where you're seeing volatility? Or is it just in the other things you mentioned such as fuel margins and potential disruptions or whatever you're thinking about with avian flu?\n\n---\n\nYes, I'll answer part of it. I'll let Mike or Mike answer the other part. If you look at the change, during the quarter would be more driven by inflation, clearly is a little -- ended the quarter slower than it started out in the quarter. So the change has been more inflation-driven. Tonnage has been pretty consistent -- or was pretty consistent. If you look at this quarter, quarter-to-date, we would still be slightly ahead of the range that we gave for the balance of the year. And part of the reason for that is we expect inflation to continue to get lower as we go through the year. In terms of the avian flu and some of the other pieces, Mike or Mike?\n\n---\n\nWhen we just -- Andy, when we sat back and looked at all the factors out there and the fact that even though it's -- even though on a calendar, we're almost halfway through the year, but for Kroger, we're only a quarter of the way through the year, we just thought it was very early to change our EPS guidance for the year given the volatility in a lot of commodities inside inflation, giving -- given what could be an unknown effect of the avian virus as we go throughout the year, volatility in fuel. Again, we're very happy with where we are and we think given the 8% to 11% growth rate off of a very strong last year, being able to deliver in that range and continue to produce the results on the cadence we projected we think will result in a very fine year.\n\n---\n\nI'm not sure if you answered this yet. If you did, forgive me, but in terms of ID sales into 2Q, how are they progressing quarter-to-date, even if just on a qualitative basis? And are there any timing issues, any items we should be aware of as we model that near-term top line?\n\n---\n\nKen, as I just mentioned, if you look at the identicals so far this quarter, we continue to be a little ahead of the range guidance we gave for the year. Part of that is driven because we believe inflation will continue to decline during the year, and we would still expect that based on what we're seeing today when you look at the impact on identicals.\n\n---\n\nI did miss it when you just said it. I apologize. Broader question, we've seen quite a sudden market share shift in food retail in general away from sort of specialty channels back toward, for lack of a better term, the Krogers of the world, more traditional, I know you don't love that term, but more traditional grocers. I think the general thesis out there, which I agree with, is that much of the shift is generated by you and some peers adding natural and organic products, but it seems like better for you isn't quite big enough to move the needle as much as what we've seen. So are there any other drivers that you are seeing out there that would sort of explain this kind of quick shift in consumer behavior? Or is it just too vague and too hard to tell?\n\n---\n\nYes, I'm not sure. I guess, I'll speak for myself a little bit here. I'm not sure I 100% agree with your thesis. When you look at some of the specialty retailers, just because some of them have reported lower ID sales than what their trend has been, they continue to open stores. They have a little bit of cannibalization, and a lot of them continue to post ID sales above what the market would be growing at. So I wouldn't subscribe to the theory that there's necessarily a sudden shift in market share away from them. It may be a slower growth in market share gain, but I wouldn't say it's a shift away from them. We actually -- we can't ask our customers where did you shop before. When they -- when our IDs go up 5.1%, we believe we're taking share and more sales dollars from our customers from a wide variety of retailers and are happy to do that, and that's really what we focus on. But I think our sales strength comes from a broad base of folks, including doing a better job of offering new and unique products that they may not be able to get somewhere else, like Simple Truth. But I think -- I wouldn't -- if I were sitting in their chairs, I wouldn't necessarily be embarrassed by some of the recent results they've had.\n\n---\n\nAnd I will answer your question a little different than how Mike did. If you look at the Fresh side of our business, produce, meat and some of those departments, deli, we're having incredibly strong growth. Some of that is improving freshness. Some of it is that customers wanting to eat products that's fresher. And that is something that we have a huge competitive advantage versus a lot of our competitors because the variety that we offer, we offer it all, plus we do still have some -- there are certain products you just can't get an organic item or a natural item. So we're able to make your full shop with us. So it's really a position of strength for us and an opportunity for us to continue to deliver.\n\n---\n\nThere's been quite a few questions about competitive environment, but I'll tack on another one. Are you seeing anything different in the promotional environment as the quarter progressed, or even over the last month?\n\n---\n\nWell, we probably have seen different competitive pockets of activity around the country, but that's not unusual. But as a company, we just tend to deal with that as things change and as our customers -- try to meet our customers' needs in the most beneficial way to them. But there's nothing really specific that I can put my finger on, but again, there is promotional activity. But when you have as broad a geography as we have, you see just about everything throughout the course of time. So yes, nothing I can really put my finger on.\n\n---\n\nI guess, maybe more specifically, are you seeing anything different on the margin environment for your natural and organic food part of the portfolio?\n\n---\n\nNothing that I would say is worth reporting, but -- most of what we see today is just this mainstreaming of natural and organics continues, but I wouldn't say there's additional retail pressure on those categories, I guess.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And one more quick one for me, you talked a little bit about the growth in loyal households. Wondering if you could give us a sense of how fast that growth was and what kind of share of wallet you're getting now from those loyal customers?\n\n---\n\nWell, we -- I can say we're pleased with transactions, and number of households and visits per household and spend per customer. So in general, it's very healthy for us right now. I really don't want to get too specific about any of the numbers, but overall, it's been a combination of those factors that have been driving our ID sales.\n\n---\n\nTypically, you don't comment obviously on M&A activity, but I was wondering if you perhaps could opine a little bit on if there were to be a merger between Ahold and Delhaize, whether that would at all impact your competitive position in those markets where you do overlap with the 2 companies.\n\n---\n\nThe -- you're correct when you say we don't comment on mergers. So I won't talk about the particular specifics on the one you asked about. But any time companies merge, it creates certain opportunities and you try to make sure that you deal with the opportunities that are created, and different ones create different kinds of opportunities. And it really is you sit down and say what is the right strategy for this particular one? So -- and we wouldn't look at, if the 2 of them merge, any different than whenever somebody else merges. And we believe there'll be continued consolidation in our industry and we have every intentions of being a consolidator in that consolidation of the industry. And as you know, we've participated in several mergers over the last year and the last several years.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then if I perhaps may ask a derivative question. Obviously you've seen the news of CVS and Target working together right now for the operation of the pharmacy stores within the Target locations. I presume that Kroger remains fully committed to operating the respective pharmacy locations you have within your different formats yourselves going forward?\n\n---\n\nWell, we love the pharmacy business and the whole offer that it offers for the customer, and we continue to see strength -- strong results there. One of the things that if you look at the average volume per location and some of that, we would have very, very strong performance on a per location basis and continue to do very well and grow. So we're...\n\n---\n\nSo Rodney kind of teed this up because you said you see yourself as a consolidator in the business and so I know, Mike, I think you said your leverage is 2.09. Thinking about your balance sheet, what is your capacity to do further transactions?\n\n---\n\nWell, I think the answer to that question isn't what my financial capacity is, it's what's the capacity of the organization to do something, it's what assets might be available, and do they fit the metrics that we typically would go after when you would look at a transaction. So we wouldn't sit back and say, oh, Harris Teeter's behind us. We've delevered. Let's go spend another $2.5 billion, get it back up to 2.4 and work our way back down. It's really quite the opposite. It's one of the reasons we try to maintain the ratio where it is if an opportunity does come up, can we take on the leverage of that correct unique opportunity, act on it, have the rating agencies continue to have the believability in us doing what we say, and that is we told them 18 to 24 months we'd get our leverage back down. It took 12, and it went down again this year. And I think the statistics we went through with the return of capital to shareholders as well as what we've invested back in the business, all told, when you add that up, it's about $4.5 billion we either returned or invested. And to maintain debt at a flat level really demonstrates the power of the cash that we can generate as a company.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Second question is, and I know we touched on some of the natural and organic guys and other things just, but I was just kind of broadly looking at the space, you guys commented tonnage growth has accelerated. It seems to me that your market share gains are accelerating. Why, I guess? What's changing? Why is more market share accreting to Kroger at an accelerating rate? And is -- does your outlook -- forget gas and inflation, but just basically is the outlook over the next 12 to 24 months that this pattern is going to continue?\n\n---\n\nFor us, the progress that we've made overall, we really would give our hats off to our associates. It's our associates interacting one-on-one every time and helping make the customers' experience a little bit better is what's driving the results, and it's our ability to support our associates to deliver great service. So it's -- I don't know that there's a big magic wand that we're waving. It really is 100 small things but doing each one of those things a little bit better and our associates continue to improve our execution and giving us feedback so we can keep getting better. And then using the insights we have working with 84.51° and then now going forward, we'll be able to work with others broader than just 84.51°. So it's all of those things together that's supporting that.\n\n---\n\nRight. And if I could have one more. Publix continues to encroach. How do you stop that, and what do you think about that?\n\n---\n\nWell, we would say about Publix the way we would say about tons of competitors, Walmart, Costco and on and on and on. They're a great competitor. We always learn a lot from them because they do a great job running their stores, and we don't look at so much in terms of how do you stop a specific competitor. We're really focused on how do we make sure we keep getting better, and if they're successful in a market, they're successful at somebody else's expense, not us.\n\n---\n\nI was just curious if you could talk a little bit about 84.51°. I thought it was interesting that you -- I think Rodney characterized it as a game changer, and I understand that you'll -- the new structure allows you to work with outside data service providers in conjunction with 84.51°, but just curious if you could talk a little bit more about what are some of the priorities in terms of how you would like to expand the use of that business for Kroger.\n\n---\n\nYes, the -- how do I answer your question without our competitors understanding exactly what we're trying to do? The -- I can tell you I've had more dialogue, and several of us have, in terms of how do we better use the data we have for the benefit of our customers and to run our business better. And we've had more of those discussions in the last 8 weeks than we had in the 2 years before that because we spent an awful lot of time talking about things other than Kroger. So to us, there -- and as I mentioned in my prepared comments, there are a lot of great people at 84.51° that we're just so excited for them to be part of our family, and I know they're so excited because they're going to be able to even help us accelerate what we're doing. So it's really hard to say specifics other than I can tell you we have a huge list of things that we can use our data for, for the benefit of our customers and running our business better that would, for whatever reason, we hadn't taken advantage of. And we're going to figure out a way to prioritize that and figure out a way to take advantage of that, and some of those cases will involve partnering with other companies other than just 84.51°.\n\n---\n\nThat's helpful, and any comments on what's the strategy? Or is there a strategy to grow the 84.51° business with other retailers or clients like Kroger, so the company can grow its own profitability and growth?\n\n---\n\nYes, we really won't comment on that at this point.\r\n \r\nBefore we end today's call, I'd like to share some additional thoughts with our associates listening in today. We recently wrapped up our Red, White and Barbecue celebration in stores across our company. Special thanks to each of you for making this exciting event possible, and I can tell you I personally ate way too much on the samples. Our customers loved kicking off the summer grilling season with fresh flavors and fun ideas to share with their family and friends. I also want to thank you for helping show Kroger's gratitude to our active duty troops and our nation's 23 million veterans this summer. Through our partnership with the USO and the Honoring Our Heroes campaign, we hope to raise an additional $2 million for our military men and women. Together, Kroger's associates and customers have raised more than $11.9 million since 2010 to support USO programs. This represents the largest gift to the USO in its history. Visit the Honoring our Heroes website for more information about how you can help. We also continue to hire our heroes. More than 29,000 veterans have joined our team since 2009, including more than 6,000 associates last year. Thank you for helping welcome them to our Kroger family. \r\nThat completes our call today, and thanks for joining.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Edward Kelly (Analysts)】\nSo my first question, I guess, is just related to the guidance. So I guess, maybe more for Mike, but you obviously raised your ID guidance for the year. You had a good, strong quarter but you maintained the EPS guidance. So I'm just kind of curious, at this point, is it just early and you want to be conservative? Or are there other incremental offsets that are maybe new?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nIt's a variety of factors, Ed, and one, it is early in the year. And as we said in both the release and in the prepared comments, the operating environment's a bit volatile right now. There's a lot of volatility in fuel prices. They've obviously come in very quickly to a more normal range from where the range was at the end of the year last year. We know that will be a headwind in the fourth quarter. It was baked into our original 8% to 11%. Our actual first quarter results, while ahead of The Street, were just a little bit over the 8% to 11% range, and we had expected to be the near the high end of the range ourselves, which was our original guidance on cadence. And then just the volatility of inflation that's out there. While we've seen some categories with deflation, we know that pharmacy inflation is actually as high as it's been over the last several years. In the first quarter, it's right at double digits. And then a little bit of concern or thought process about the avian virus with the poultry flocks and how that might affect input costs later in the year and what's going to happen with availability of those products. So when we stepped back and thought about it, while we're pleased with the first quarter, we thought the most prudent move given the uncertainty -- or the volatility of some of the things out there was to maintain our guidance range. We had guided in March that if fuel margins came in, it may put us at the low end. We aren't saying we're going to be at the low end, but we're maintaining the range because that actually has happened with fuel.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Edward Kelly (Analysts)】\nAnd Mike, historically, you've kind of said about $0.14 or so a gallon in fuel. Obviously, this quarter's lower, but kind of like the slope of the curve was rising. Is there anything else that's changed in the marketplace or maybe it's become a bit more competitive, where you're a little concerned about the $0.14?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nI -- we -- I wouldn't say we've focused on any one number. Our practice on fuel is to follow the market, and then give our most loyal customers a really good value on fuel by the -- our fuel rewards program, which I'll remind everybody the cost of that reduces our ID sales, it doesn't reduce the fuel margin. And it's really just what's happening in the marketplace as we follow the marketplace and stay right on The Street price and the signs but then give that incremental reward. I wouldn't say there's anything unusual in the first quarter. Any short period of time in fuel is an interesting result but a longer period of time is what's more important.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nAnd we -- internally, we usually use a rolling 4-quarter number. This year, we didn't just because of how strong fuel margins were in the third and fourth quarter. And as Mike mentioned, on a daily basis, we're probably never right, but usually over the year, it gets pretty close.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rupesh Parikh (Analysts)】\nSo I just wanted to follow up a little more just on inflation. For this upcoming year, have you guys changed your inflation forecast?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nYes, we're still expecting it to be in the 1% to 2% range. We're actually at the high end of that range in the first quarter, a lot of that driven by the pharmaceutical inflation that Mike mentioned -- or we mentioned in the prepared comments, primarily in the generic arena. So that's out there. We do expect to see some potential inflation out there in the poultry flocks as the avian flu issue hits. We don't know what's going to happen with all of the input ingredients that go into products from liquid eggs and how that might affect a lot of products that contain that as an ingredient. So we think that 1% to 2% is right. So far, that's what we're seeing.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rupesh Parikh (Analysts)】\nOkay, thanks for the color. And then switching topics, maybe to your competition. We hear a lot about capacity growth in the specialty grocery arena and even some -- even I guess, more commentary out there on the hard discount channel. What are you seeing right now from competitor openings in, I guess, from a full-service grocery perspective?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nWell, from a full service, I guess, I would say it's probably been pretty consistent over the last 3 or 4 years. Not -- certainly not aggressive. Certainly, if you look at the niche merchants, there would be much higher growth there, but we consider everybody a competitor. So we don't -- we wouldn't segment it as different as what probably most people would think we would.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Karen Short (Analysts)】\nSo I'm just curious on, well, maybe this is just semantics, Mike, and maybe I'm overreading, but just to clarify on your guidance by quarter, you said just now that 3Q, you expect it to be at the high end of your guidance? I think last quarter you said it would be slightly above?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nYes, if you look at second and third quarter, actually I think second quarter we said at high end and third quarter above. We just flip flopped those a little bit. It takes $8 million flipping between quarters to do that, and it's just our best thinking today. So it doesn't affect the year. I think if you look back to what we just said in March, the guidance on those 2 quarters just flipped between quarters. We still expect a very strong year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Karen Short (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then on tonnage, I don't know if you guys would be willing to give an actual percent tonnage number. And then, I guess, following on that, I guess, when I look at O&A, your O&A growth rate definitely seemed higher than what I would have expected. I know in the past, we -- you talked about tonnage impacting that number, but maybe just some color on those 2.\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nYes, relative to tonnage, we won't give an actual number. As Mike said in his prepared comments, it was the strongest we've had since 2010, and we haven't given a specific number, but we're very pleased with where it is. If you think about in the comments I made on OG&A, we're very pleased with the leverage we've got of 15 basis point reduction in that as a rate of sales. We did make conscious decisions to invest in other keys of our 4 key strategy versus price to provide a better shopping experience to our customers, both through making sure the products are on the shelves in a timely basis, having our associates friendly and we keep our products as fresh as possible. So there was some conscious decision to invest in incremental services for our customers, which provides more jobs and hours for our associates as well.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nThe other thing on tonnage, we always try to give an outline of where we are and how it feels, but it's very hard to calculate. And when a customer buys a 24 unit of something versus a 12 unit of something in our -- internally, we count that as one and one.\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nOr water, the common package for bottled water today is 32 bottles. It used to be 24. That's still a unit.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nIt's not that we're trying to avoid the question. It's just that it's -- there's an awful lot of assumptions behind that, and what we try to do is give everybody a general feel for what's going on.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Karen Short (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then just on the ClickList, I guess, in Cincinnati. I mean, obviously I know you guys are always very conservative and want to make sure your customer is getting the best experience, but it definitely seemed like it was a pretty long test phase. So I guess, maybe can you maybe clarify or give some color on what you ironed out, and what made you feel comfortable to roll it out now, and how quickly you think you could accelerate that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nYes, the length of the test would seem long just because it became public a lot faster than we had intended to because somehow, one of the newspaper folks that follow us found the actual website that we were testing with our associates. So it's not that it was longer than normal. It's just that it was public longer than what we normally would. It's tracking -- if you look at our original plan, we're tracking on exactly where we thought we would be on the original plan, and feel good about it. And then Mike just pointed out to me, we just added our second store, I guess it was this week or last week.\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nAnd again that's in a beta test and you kind of have to know it's there. It's a new experience for us, and we just want to make sure it's right.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Vincent Sinisi (Analysts)】\nI wanted to ask you first about really the private label, in particular the Simple Truth, if you could just give us a quick update in terms of where that brand is today? If over the first quarter there had been any updates in terms of product expansion and how big that particular segment is for you right now.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ellis (Executives)】\nThe brand, we're very pleased with. I think you'll find around 2,600 SKUs in our stores today and talk about connecting with the customer in a meaningful way. They have taken the brand and really embraced the brand. For us, it's been not only strategic, but it's really lining up with what customers are looking for today. And you can also buy it now on Vitacost.com. And it's available there also, so anybody who -- even if you don't shop in a Kroger market, you're able to get the product today. But no, we've been totally -- completely pleased with the progress we're making, and there are many more new items to come.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Vincent Sinisi (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then maybe just as a follow-up, sticking with the natural segment, as you're continuing to learn the Vitacost division and as you're -- as you mentioned, you have the Soopers site now up, have you had any further progress? I know it's still admittedly pretty early, but have you had any further progress that you could share with us in terms of maybe bringing some more of those products that had historically been Vitacost into some of your other banners?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ellis (Executives)】\nWell, today, we have a pretty good selection of natural foods, supplements, body building products, health care products in our stores. Vitacost really just helps us fulfill that long tail of items that are smaller in some cases, and on the King Soopers website now, you can pick up 25,000 to 30,000 additional SKUs than what you'd find in a typical Kroger store. So it's really helped us take natural foods, natural products to the customer in a much broader way. We're really pleased with where we're headed. There's a lot of work still to do. We're approaching our first anniversary with Vitacost next month, and so we're actually moving pretty fast as a company and we're pleased with where we're headed.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Heinbockel (Analysts)】\nSo Rodney, I want to start with -- you put up a quarter like this, but I know you guys can be somewhat self-critical. When you step back and say, from a skill set standpoint or a business line standpoint, where are you still not where you want to be in a significant way, not we're 90% of the way there but we have a lot of work to do? And then as part of that, address maybe the issue of speed to market and that being a more important skill set to work on over the next couple of years.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nThe shortest hard question to answer, and when I did my own performance review with our Board, somebody asked the same question. And you've followed Kroger for a long time, and you realize when you look at our culture overall, we're always very proud of what we've accomplished. But at the same time, we feel like we have a tremendous opportunity to get better, and a lot of times, we like to use the words that our to-do list is longer than our done list. And when you look at what's out in front of us, we are incredibly excited about the opportunities that we see to continue to get better. And the hardest thing that we have to do is actually make sure that we're trying not to improve on all things at once, but what are the things that are most important to the customer and put all our resources against that. So I guess that the way I would say overall is obviously, we're delighted with the quarter, delighted with the progress we're making. We're even more excited about the opportunity to continue to get better. So I feel very good about where we are, but I feel even better about the opportunities we have in front of us.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Heinbockel (Analysts)】\nBut are there certain -- there have to be, right, certain product categories -- I don't want to get into geographic differences, but certain product categories, businesses, customer groups that you're not fully resonating with yet, it'd have to be those, and what would tie those together, if anything?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nIt's -- probably I'm trying to think of the easiest way to answer your question because it's a very good question. The -- it's more opportunity. So if you think about like apparel, where you just -- we've added apparel to, I don't know, I think we're up to 70-some marketplace stores. We're still learning what is the right selection of product to have that's in a marketplace store. Obviously, the Fred Meyer Group helps us get insight and procures the product for us through that channel, but we're still learning what's the right things to put in. And there's a ton of those kind of things going on, so it's really hard to say we're -- there's one specific item or one specific customer. It's much broader than that, and it's 100 different things versus just one thing that we're really trying to get better at.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Heinbockel (Analysts)】\nAll right. And then just lastly, when you think about pricing, right, and pricing being a journey, it looks to me like, whether it's traditional competitors or mass, there's been some stabilization with regard to pricing, right? It's not a race to the bottom. Is that fair? And at this point, you're largely where you need to be. And the adjustments to come, is it -- do you think it's more kind of rifle -- you sort of look at maybe the hard discounters and work to be done on private label pricing, but are we stable and largely there and it's just selective guys you've got to address at this point?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nIf you look at longer term on pricing, as you know, over the last several years, we've invested in price as we reduced OG&A to take costs out of the business. The last few quarters, we have been a little more aggressive in investing in service. So it's not just price based. So if you look at the mix of where we invest, we have invested some of that cost reduction in additional service hours and things like that. So it's a journey that you never arrive at a destination, so you're continually making progress, and you continually change based on your competitive -- your competitors change as well. So we're happy where we are, but we are continuing to invest but it's really driven by as we get costs out of the business. I don't know if, Mike, anything you'd want to add to that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nNo, I absolutely agree. It's right in sync with the prepared comments we had. And I'll just throw in, when you think about our 4 keys, we're constantly asking ourselves what do we invest in to make sure that we're offering the best balance to the customer based on what the customer wants and the retail environment that we're in. So Rodney's point about investing more in our people in the last few quarters is right on.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Meredith Adler (Analysts)】\nOne question would just be, real quickly, you talked about where your guidance for inflation was for the year but did you comment on what you thought inflation was for the quarter?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nWe did not. But Mike...\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nWe're at the high end of that range, primarily driven by Pharmacy. It's about 1/8. If you look at it without Pharmacy, it would have been lower, and the comments we had on a volatile operating environment is -- if you just get rid of the headline news on inflation and you start to dig into the commodities, you have things going all over the world. And one of the things I think we're most proud of this quarter is there were so many things bouncing around, and our ability to manage through that this quarter really showed up in our results.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Meredith Adler (Analysts)】\nGreat. And then I was wondering if you would talk at all about the formats that you're testing called Ruler. I think you maybe have about 30 stores, and I was just wondering what your thoughts are. And we do know that Aldi is going to be opening more stores in Southern California is getting a big push, and Lidl is also going to be coming to the U.S. pretty soon, just how do you feel about that format? And do you want to be a competitor in that format?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nWe're still -- it's still very early and it's obviously a test for us. It's one of the things where we feel good about the progress the team made. The format actually came to us through one of our mergers. When we merged with Jay C, they had the format even back then, and the team has made a lot of changes to what's inside of it, and we continue to make changes. I wouldn't say that we're ready for prime time yet, but we are making progress in the right direction. And it really ties back to when you look at -- you've heard us over the years talk a lot about how customers are bifurcating, and we want to make sure that we have a format that serves all customers, and there's certain customers that living on a budget is really important because either they want to or they have to, and it's operating a store as efficient as you can to give the best prices you can. So it really ties to that. I don't know, Mike, anything you want to add to that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ellis (Executives)】\nJust what we learned from this type of a format has really been helpful to better understand that value segment and how to operate in that value world. So we've really, as a company, learned a lot, I think.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Meredith Adler (Analysts)】\nGreat. And then just real quickly, I know you said your natural organic department was up double digits. Did you see any changes at all? I think there are some other retailers that have said there was a bit of a slowdown, I think primarily in the dry grocery side, but I don't know, it doesn't sound like you saw anything, but did you?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nNothing that I can put my finger on. It's still real healthy for us. Again, we have good supplies, so we haven't had any issues around that. But no, customers still are as interested in the natural category, the natural foods world, real food, we call it, as they ever have been.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Wolf (Analysts)】\nI wanted to follow up on your thinking around the guidance. I think you said the quarter came in slightly above, with fuel, slightly below. So how does that, if we just isolate the stores, does that mean the stores was little better than that versus internal expectations?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nYes, I think the strong IDs without fuel would demonstrate how happy we are with our core grocery performance, and our -- that's built into our expectations for the year when we raised ID sales guidance without fuel. So we're very pleased with what's going on inside the 4 walls of the store.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Wolf (Analysts)】\nOkay. And Meredith asked about the, I guess, the cadence on natural, but I'd like to ask about it just on a -- across the store. It sounds like, from your answer and the answer on natural, that there hasn't been a big fall off or some volatility on the consumer side. I think it sounds to me like the worry is more on the supply side, whether it's the fuel margins coming in or what's going to happen with some of the commodities.\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nYes, I'm not sure I understood the last part of the question on the supply side, Andrew.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Wolf (Analysts)】\nWell, first of all, I want to ask if you're seeing any change in your sales cadence, and is that where you're seeing volatility? Or is it just in the other things you mentioned such as fuel margins and potential disruptions or whatever you're thinking about with avian flu?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nYes, I'll answer part of it. I'll let Mike or Mike answer the other part. If you look at the change, during the quarter would be more driven by inflation, clearly is a little -- ended the quarter slower than it started out in the quarter. So the change has been more inflation-driven. Tonnage has been pretty consistent -- or was pretty consistent. If you look at this quarter, quarter-to-date, we would still be slightly ahead of the range that we gave for the balance of the year. And part of the reason for that is we expect inflation to continue to get lower as we go through the year. In terms of the avian flu and some of the other pieces, Mike or Mike?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nWhen we just -- Andy, when we sat back and looked at all the factors out there and the fact that even though it's -- even though on a calendar, we're almost halfway through the year, but for Kroger, we're only a quarter of the way through the year, we just thought it was very early to change our EPS guidance for the year given the volatility in a lot of commodities inside inflation, giving -- given what could be an unknown effect of the avian virus as we go throughout the year, volatility in fuel. Again, we're very happy with where we are and we think given the 8% to 11% growth rate off of a very strong last year, being able to deliver in that range and continue to produce the results on the cadence we projected we think will result in a very fine year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kenneth Goldman (Analysts)】\nI'm not sure if you answered this yet. If you did, forgive me, but in terms of ID sales into 2Q, how are they progressing quarter-to-date, even if just on a qualitative basis? And are there any timing issues, any items we should be aware of as we model that near-term top line?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nKen, as I just mentioned, if you look at the identicals so far this quarter, we continue to be a little ahead of the range guidance we gave for the year. Part of that is driven because we believe inflation will continue to decline during the year, and we would still expect that based on what we're seeing today when you look at the impact on identicals.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kenneth Goldman (Analysts)】\nI did miss it when you just said it. I apologize. Broader question, we've seen quite a sudden market share shift in food retail in general away from sort of specialty channels back toward, for lack of a better term, the Krogers of the world, more traditional, I know you don't love that term, but more traditional grocers. I think the general thesis out there, which I agree with, is that much of the shift is generated by you and some peers adding natural and organic products, but it seems like better for you isn't quite big enough to move the needle as much as what we've seen. So are there any other drivers that you are seeing out there that would sort of explain this kind of quick shift in consumer behavior? Or is it just too vague and too hard to tell?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nYes, I'm not sure. I guess, I'll speak for myself a little bit here. I'm not sure I 100% agree with your thesis. When you look at some of the specialty retailers, just because some of them have reported lower ID sales than what their trend has been, they continue to open stores. They have a little bit of cannibalization, and a lot of them continue to post ID sales above what the market would be growing at. So I wouldn't subscribe to the theory that there's necessarily a sudden shift in market share away from them. It may be a slower growth in market share gain, but I wouldn't say it's a shift away from them. We actually -- we can't ask our customers where did you shop before. When they -- when our IDs go up 5.1%, we believe we're taking share and more sales dollars from our customers from a wide variety of retailers and are happy to do that, and that's really what we focus on. But I think our sales strength comes from a broad base of folks, including doing a better job of offering new and unique products that they may not be able to get somewhere else, like Simple Truth. But I think -- I wouldn't -- if I were sitting in their chairs, I wouldn't necessarily be embarrassed by some of the recent results they've had.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nAnd I will answer your question a little different than how Mike did. If you look at the Fresh side of our business, produce, meat and some of those departments, deli, we're having incredibly strong growth. Some of that is improving freshness. Some of it is that customers wanting to eat products that's fresher. And that is something that we have a huge competitive advantage versus a lot of our competitors because the variety that we offer, we offer it all, plus we do still have some -- there are certain products you just can't get an organic item or a natural item. So we're able to make your full shop with us. So it's really a position of strength for us and an opportunity for us to continue to deliver.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Alvin Concepcion (Analysts)】\nThere's been quite a few questions about competitive environment, but I'll tack on another one. Are you seeing anything different in the promotional environment as the quarter progressed, or even over the last month?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ellis (Executives)】\nWell, we probably have seen different competitive pockets of activity around the country, but that's not unusual. But as a company, we just tend to deal with that as things change and as our customers -- try to meet our customers' needs in the most beneficial way to them. But there's nothing really specific that I can put my finger on, but again, there is promotional activity. But when you have as broad a geography as we have, you see just about everything throughout the course of time. So yes, nothing I can really put my finger on.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Alvin Concepcion (Analysts)】\nI guess, maybe more specifically, are you seeing anything different on the margin environment for your natural and organic food part of the portfolio?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ellis (Executives)】\nNothing that I would say is worth reporting, but -- most of what we see today is just this mainstreaming of natural and organics continues, but I wouldn't say there's additional retail pressure on those categories, I guess.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Alvin Concepcion (Analysts)】\nGreat. And one more quick one for me, you talked a little bit about the growth in loyal households. Wondering if you could give us a sense of how fast that growth was and what kind of share of wallet you're getting now from those loyal customers?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ellis (Executives)】\nWell, we -- I can say we're pleased with transactions, and number of households and visits per household and spend per customer. So in general, it's very healthy for us right now. I really don't want to get too specific about any of the numbers, but overall, it's been a combination of those factors that have been driving our ID sales.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Filippe Goossens (Analysts)】\nTypically, you don't comment obviously on M&A activity, but I was wondering if you perhaps could opine a little bit on if there were to be a merger between Ahold and Delhaize, whether that would at all impact your competitive position in those markets where you do overlap with the 2 companies.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nThe -- you're correct when you say we don't comment on mergers. So I won't talk about the particular specifics on the one you asked about. But any time companies merge, it creates certain opportunities and you try to make sure that you deal with the opportunities that are created, and different ones create different kinds of opportunities. And it really is you sit down and say what is the right strategy for this particular one? So -- and we wouldn't look at, if the 2 of them merge, any different than whenever somebody else merges. And we believe there'll be continued consolidation in our industry and we have every intentions of being a consolidator in that consolidation of the industry. And as you know, we've participated in several mergers over the last year and the last several years.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Filippe Goossens (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then if I perhaps may ask a derivative question. Obviously you've seen the news of CVS and Target working together right now for the operation of the pharmacy stores within the Target locations. I presume that Kroger remains fully committed to operating the respective pharmacy locations you have within your different formats yourselves going forward?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nWell, we love the pharmacy business and the whole offer that it offers for the customer, and we continue to see strength -- strong results there. One of the things that if you look at the average volume per location and some of that, we would have very, very strong performance on a per location basis and continue to do very well and grow. So we're...\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Mushkin (Analysts)】\nSo Rodney kind of teed this up because you said you see yourself as a consolidator in the business and so I know, Mike, I think you said your leverage is 2.09. Thinking about your balance sheet, what is your capacity to do further transactions?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nWell, I think the answer to that question isn't what my financial capacity is, it's what's the capacity of the organization to do something, it's what assets might be available, and do they fit the metrics that we typically would go after when you would look at a transaction. So we wouldn't sit back and say, oh, Harris Teeter's behind us. We've delevered. Let's go spend another $2.5 billion, get it back up to 2.4 and work our way back down. It's really quite the opposite. It's one of the reasons we try to maintain the ratio where it is if an opportunity does come up, can we take on the leverage of that correct unique opportunity, act on it, have the rating agencies continue to have the believability in us doing what we say, and that is we told them 18 to 24 months we'd get our leverage back down. It took 12, and it went down again this year. And I think the statistics we went through with the return of capital to shareholders as well as what we've invested back in the business, all told, when you add that up, it's about $4.5 billion we either returned or invested. And to maintain debt at a flat level really demonstrates the power of the cash that we can generate as a company.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Mushkin (Analysts)】\nOkay. Second question is, and I know we touched on some of the natural and organic guys and other things just, but I was just kind of broadly looking at the space, you guys commented tonnage growth has accelerated. It seems to me that your market share gains are accelerating. Why, I guess? What's changing? Why is more market share accreting to Kroger at an accelerating rate? And is -- does your outlook -- forget gas and inflation, but just basically is the outlook over the next 12 to 24 months that this pattern is going to continue?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nFor us, the progress that we've made overall, we really would give our hats off to our associates. It's our associates interacting one-on-one every time and helping make the customers' experience a little bit better is what's driving the results, and it's our ability to support our associates to deliver great service. So it's -- I don't know that there's a big magic wand that we're waving. It really is 100 small things but doing each one of those things a little bit better and our associates continue to improve our execution and giving us feedback so we can keep getting better. And then using the insights we have working with 84.51° and then now going forward, we'll be able to work with others broader than just 84.51°. So it's all of those things together that's supporting that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Mushkin (Analysts)】\nRight. And if I could have one more. Publix continues to encroach. How do you stop that, and what do you think about that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nWell, we would say about Publix the way we would say about tons of competitors, Walmart, Costco and on and on and on. They're a great competitor. We always learn a lot from them because they do a great job running their stores, and we don't look at so much in terms of how do you stop a specific competitor. We're really focused on how do we make sure we keep getting better, and if they're successful in a market, they're successful at somebody else's expense, not us.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kelly Bania (Analysts)】\nI was just curious if you could talk a little bit about 84.51°. I thought it was interesting that you -- I think Rodney characterized it as a game changer, and I understand that you'll -- the new structure allows you to work with outside data service providers in conjunction with 84.51°, but just curious if you could talk a little bit more about what are some of the priorities in terms of how you would like to expand the use of that business for Kroger.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nYes, the -- how do I answer your question without our competitors understanding exactly what we're trying to do? The -- I can tell you I've had more dialogue, and several of us have, in terms of how do we better use the data we have for the benefit of our customers and to run our business better. And we've had more of those discussions in the last 8 weeks than we had in the 2 years before that because we spent an awful lot of time talking about things other than Kroger. So to us, there -- and as I mentioned in my prepared comments, there are a lot of great people at 84.51° that we're just so excited for them to be part of our family, and I know they're so excited because they're going to be able to even help us accelerate what we're doing. So it's really hard to say specifics other than I can tell you we have a huge list of things that we can use our data for, for the benefit of our customers and running our business better that would, for whatever reason, we hadn't taken advantage of. And we're going to figure out a way to prioritize that and figure out a way to take advantage of that, and some of those cases will involve partnering with other companies other than just 84.51°.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kelly Bania (Analysts)】\nThat's helpful, and any comments on what's the strategy? Or is there a strategy to grow the 84.51° business with other retailers or clients like Kroger, so the company can grow its own profitability and growth?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nYes, we really won't comment on that at this point.\r\n \r\nBefore we end today's call, I'd like to share some additional thoughts with our associates listening in today. We recently wrapped up our Red, White and Barbecue celebration in stores across our company. Special thanks to each of you for making this exciting event possible, and I can tell you I personally ate way too much on the samples. Our customers loved kicking off the summer grilling season with fresh flavors and fun ideas to share with their family and friends. I also want to thank you for helping show Kroger's gratitude to our active duty troops and our nation's 23 million veterans this summer. Through our partnership with the USO and the Honoring Our Heroes campaign, we hope to raise an additional $2 million for our military men and women. Together, Kroger's associates and customers have raised more than $11.9 million since 2010 to support USO programs. This represents the largest gift to the USO in its history. Visit the Honoring our Heroes website for more information about how you can help. We also continue to hire our heroes. More than 29,000 veterans have joined our team since 2009, including more than 6,000 associates last year. Thank you for helping welcome them to our Kroger family. \r\nThat completes our call today, and thanks for joining.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you, operator. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss NIKE's fiscal 2015 fourth quarter results. As the operator indicated, participants on today's call may discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the appropriate reconciliations in our press release, which was issued about an hour ago, and at our website, investors.nike.com.\r\nJoining us on today's call will be NIKE, Inc. President and CEO, Mark Parker; followed by Trevor Edwards, President of the NIKE Brand. And finally, Don Blair, in his final earnings call, as our Chief Financial Officer, will give you an overview of our financial results. Following their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you for your cooperation on this. \r\nI'll now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc. President and CEO, Mark Parker.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Kelley, and hello, everyone. Fiscal year '15 was an outstanding year for NIKE, Inc. We've shown once again that NIKE is a growth company. \r\nHere are the fiscal '15 highlights. NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 10% to $30.6 billion despite significant FX headwinds. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 14%. Gross margin increased 120 basis points to 46%. Earnings per share rose 25% to $3.70 and we delivered ROIC of 28%. These are the quality results that our shareholders have come to expect from us and that we demand from ourselves.\r\nOne of the reasons we're able to deliver results like these are the talented people who work at NIKE around the world. So before going on into the detail on our results, I'd like to thank one of those talented leaders, and that's Don Blair. As you all know, this will be Don's last earnings call with NIKE. And if you're keeping track, it's 63 calls. \r\nDuring my tenure as CEO and before that as Co-President, Don has served as a trusted advisor and a valued business partner. He has helped lead the company through great times and challenging times, always with a calm focus and level of discipline that creates confidence and insures we continue to move forward. \r\nDon will always be remembered as the creator of our long-term financial model, which guides our financial planning to this day. But more than that, Don will be remembered for the talented leaders he has developed over the years, both within finance and across the company.\r\nI want to thank Don for his leadership and dedication to NIKE over the last 15 years, and wish him the very best in his future endeavors. Don's successor, Andy Campion, is a testament to Don's commitment to developing talent. Andy has been a great leader during his 8 years with NIKE, helping to develop the strategy that will drive NIKE's growth for years to come, and I'm confident that Andy will continue to build on the strong foundation Don has set for the company as we strive toward our full potential. Andy will assume the CFO role on August 1 and will join us on the next earnings call.\r\nSo while I'm proud of the results we delivered this last year, what sets NIKE apart is our ability to deliver sustainable, profitable growth year in and year out. It is our proven track record of driving growth under a variety of macroeconomic conditions that gives us the confidence we can deliver growth for years to come. This past fiscal year, we managed through a volatile currency environment and sharpened our focus in key markets, and we will continue to drive that same level of discipline and focus as we look ahead to fiscal year '16.\r\nAs we have consistently done in the past, we will leverage the power of the NIKE portfolio to drive growth. We have demonstrated time and again that our diverse portfolio of brands, categories, geographies and products is a competitive advantage that allows us to serve our consumer and drive growth better than anyone else. And you can expect us to leverage our portfolio to further unlock growth around the world to expand the market and increase share. And we'll do this by staying true to our commitment to the athlete and our commitment to innovation. \r\nI recently sat with the innovation teams for an in-depth review of our future product concepts, and I can tell you, I am incredibly energized by what's to come. Today we are pushing ourselves to create products and experiences that consumers want and some they never thought possible. The scale and pace at which we are bringing new innovations to market is unprecedented. Let me share a few examples. \r\nFlyknit, of course, continues to be one of NIKE's great breakthroughs for the athlete and for our company. It's created a whole new model for design and manufacturing. Instead of engineering down to the piece, we can now engineer it down to the pixel to enhance performance, aesthetics and sustainability. And the most exciting part is we're just discovering new ways to use it every day. We've advanced Flyknit into other sports over the past few years, but there's no doubt last summer's World Cup was the launching pad for Flyknit in Global Football. More than 1/3 of the players chose to wear the Magista, our first Flyknit boot, including Mario Götze, who scored the winning goal in the World Cup final. \r\nWhen you look across our business, Flyknit's dynamic strength and lightweight benefits have been applied across our key performance categories: Running, Basketball, Men's and Women's Training as well as into premium Sportswear. \r\nWith the success of Flyknit, we've been inspired to engineer new types of materials like Flyweave. This innovative performance weaving process pushes the limits of lightweight with superior strength, and it was introduced this year with the Jordan 29. And just a few days ago, we revealed the newest signature shoe from Kevin Durant, the KD8, which utilizes this incredible technology. I'm very excited about the potential for Flyweave, so keep an eye out for further innovation in this area.\r\nWe not only deliver new breakthroughs, but we also push ourselves to reinvent our most iconic products. Products in our Running category are a great example. This year, we matched Zoom Air in its 20th year with the Pegasus 31 to create the fastest, most responsive Pegasus to date. It proves that much better does not always have to be entirely new. \r\nWe also continue to diversify one of our greatest collections of apparel technologies, Dri-FIT. Dri-FIT is the foundation for everything from shirts to tights, to socks, and it adapts to any athlete need. Strong performance this year included Nike Pro Hyperwarm, Running Dri-FIT Knit and Running Dri-FIT Hypercool. \r\nOne of this year's greatest Dri-FIT innovations was with the Nike Pro Bra Collection. With the broadest assortment of styles and sizes, we're able to provide the athlete with the right fit and support for any type of training or sports.\r\nFinally, Dri-FIT also forms the basis for our most advanced NCAA basketball uniforms ever. Two of our longstanding partners, Duke and UConn, won the respective men's and women's national championships wearing the Nike Hyper Elite uniform. Our uniforms weigh only 11.4 ounces, and we have set every detail from vented waistbands to laser perforations, which enhance cooling and increase mobility. The Hyper Elite truly sets the standard for basketball apparel. \r\nIt is examples like these that makes me so excited to bring the full power of NIKE's innovation and creativity to the NBA. With Nike, Jordan and Converse, we can't wait to help grow the game of Basketball even farther across our entire global reach. \r\nAt NIKE, innovation comes in many forms and our growing digital ecosystem is a great example. Consumers are increasingly connected and utilizing premium, personal digital services. Digital is an accelerator of growth that is shaping everything we do, from building deep connections to consumers with digital services and communities to driving rapid expansion of our e-commerce business. This is all made possible because NIKE is one of the world's most engaged brands online. It's where we connect with the consumer 1-to-1 and it's where we connect people to one another. And we're constantly looking for new ways to seamlessly connect social platforms to commerce.\r\nEarlier this quarter, for example, Nike Women launched the Instagram shop, a new tool that allows users to click a photo and be taken directly to NIKE.com product pages. And just last week, we announced that we are one of the first partners to offer curated product collections through Twitter. And there are many more exciting opportunities to come in this space as the power of the NIKE Brand creates strong demand from consumers any time, anywhere on any platform.\r\nWe deepen our relationship with consumers through services like Nike+ Run Club and Nike+ Training Club that inspire and enable them to do more and get better. Our Nike+ Training Club app continues to build a motivated community of devoted athletes and now features 135 workouts and is available in 17 languages. Access for NIKE.com to Nike+ Run Club training plans brings together the best Nike expert running guidance to one place. There's great potential here to connect more runners to the product they need to meet their goals. And in April, we unveiled a Nike Trainer's Hub that unites the global network of elite trainers to help every athlete reach their peak potential.\r\nWe connect, motivate and inspire our community of members with great products and services because ultimately, what sets NIKE apart is our innovative product, and e-commerce is rapidly expanding our ability to serve consumers with products for any sport all over the world. \r\nFiscal '15 was a great year for NIKE.com. We delivered 51% revenue growth in Q4 with 55% growth for the full year. We saw increases in both traffic and conversion, fueled by our investments in critical infrastructure to improve the consumer experience on both desktop and mobile. And as I mentioned last quarter, our traffic on mobile has exceeded traffic on desktop, making it a very sharp point for consumer engagement going forward. \r\nI'm proud to say our e-commerce business surpassed $1 billion in revenue this past year, a fantastic achievement from all of our teams. But really, we're just scratching the surface of our potential in this area. Global consumer spending through e-commerce exceeds $1 trillion, a significant portion of which is done on mobile devices. Tremendous opportunity ahead for us in e-commerce.\r\nWhat I just recapped is by no means an exhausted list, but it clearly shows how much ground this company can cover in just 1 year. And while we're pleased with this year's results, at NIKE, we're always moving forward. We are relentless in our pursuit to get better and we see opportunities that no one else can. And most importantly, we have the resources and the talented team to deliver. \r\nFiscal '16 will be no different. We have great momentum and we will continue to drive it by growing our largest categories such as Running, Basketball, Football and our geographies such as North America, Western Europe and China. And by unlocking the areas with the greatest potential for growth such as Women's, Young Athletes and apparel, and also by accelerating new opportunities such as breakthrough technologies and product in advanced manufacturing and digital. \r\nWe have one of the strongest brands in the world with the world of opportunities still ahead. And that's why fiscal '16 will be our best year yet.\r\nThanks, and now here's Trevor.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Mark. The NIKE Brand closed the year with a strong finish, demonstrating yet again the power of the category offense to drive growth. On a constant currency basis, NIKE Brand revenue grew 13% for the quarter. For the year, revenue was up 14%, with double-digit growth in North America, both European geographies and China. \r\nNIKE Brand DTC revenue was up 27% for the quarter. For the year, DTC revenue was up 29%, driven by comp store growth of 16%, online growth of 59% and new stores. And finally, global futures accelerated to 13%, reflecting continued strong demand. \r\nThe success in our business is a natural outcome of putting the consumer at the center of everything we do. Our connection with consumers strengthens our brand every day from our own retail to wholesale partners, from in-store to online, from digital experiences to unforgettable live events. It's those deep and authentic connections that power the NIKE Brand around the world.\r\nWithin our category offense, we often talk about Amplify -- our Amplify strategy to compete, train and express. Sportswear represents the express portion of that equation, where consumers express their love and passion for the game with premium sports-inspired products. Sportswear is a key complement to the product assortment for our performance categories, offering an opportunity to elevate the design and technical innovation in traditional Sportswear styles while also creating new ones. This drove tremendous growth in the Sportswear in fiscal year '15, which was up 20% for the year.\r\nNow let's turn to a few of our performance categories. First, I'll start with Running. By serving our consumers through product innovation and consumer engagement, we drove growth in this important category with revenue up 9% for the year to nearly $5 billion. Our premium performance footwear continues to resonate with runners, led by the Air Zoom Pegasus 31 and the FlyKnit Lunar 3, and our premium Sportswear styles such as the Air Max 1 and the Roshe, also continued to drive growth. \r\nWe saw a return to growth in our core Running footwear across all markets, including North America. Core Running footwear consists of our products at mid-tier price zones. This return to growth was led by core performance styles like the Downshifter and the Wind Flow, which features Zoom Air technology. \r\nAs we continued to drive innovation, Running apparel was once again a key growth driver, led by the continued success of our Dri-FIT Knit tops and our Epic Lux tights. \r\nAnd more than ever, we're expanding our overall Running business by inspiring new generations of runners every day. As Mark discussed, giving runners the knowledge and tools they need through digital services has helped to create deeper, meaningful relationships. The opportunities to build new connections with our Nike+ community are virtually unlimited, as we add even more exclusive experiences like special product launches and Running events.\r\nNike Basketball, which in fiscal year '15, grew 21% to nearly $4 billion. Our Basketball business fueled the strength of our brand and our product innovation has never been stronger. \r\nThis year, as always, we launched incredibly innovative products for our consumers. Nike Basketball introduced great footwear such as the LeBron 12, completely redesigned to deliver precision and explosive performance, and the KYRIE 1, the first signature shoe for this dynamic and exciting young player. And in the Jordan Brand, we introduced the Air Jordan 29, the lightest Air Jordan performance shoe ever, and the Super.Fly 3, which employs NIKE's Zoom technology for lightweight, durable cushioning. \r\nWhat's more, every year, Nike Basketball and the Jordan Brand put on great consumer experiences and fiscal year '15 was no exception. Standout examples include last quarter's NBA All-Star weekend in New York and the Nike World Basketball Festival in Spain last September was a great example. These events showcase the tremendous combined power of the 2 great basketball brands, something only Nike can offer. \r\nNike Basketball and Jordan are driving the kind of energy that excites current fans and brings in new ones, growing the market today and into the future. And as Mark mentioned, our partnership with the NBA gives us tremendous opportunity to grow this sport. It's a platform for true innovation, not just for our products, but also for the many ways we can serve our consumers. This partnership will let us share our passion for Basketball in exciting places like Rio to Beijing, to Barcelona. The energy around Basketball is at an all-time high, and we're excited to accelerate its growth around the globe.\r\nFinally, our Women's business continues to drive strong growth. For the year, revenue grew 20% to nearly $6 billion. The strong growth in our Women's business is driven by the innovation and style we bring to the products that matter most to these athletes. Key apparel styles such as the Nike Pro Bra Collection and broad assortments of tights are resonating strongly with consumers and creating excitement in the marketplace. In Q4, we released our biggest ever market initiative for women called Better For It, which in just 2 months, has totaled more than 18 million online views. Better For It resonated with consumers because it wasn't just a campaign. It was a call to action for all athletes to push themselves to be their best. And it was served by the global community of women who interact with NIKE and each other every day for inspiration.\r\nOur new Women's only door in London, along with our newly reopened Santa Monica store, exemplify the focus on providing products and services specifically for women. We've also continued to increase the number of stores with premium services such as bra fitting, gait analysis and pant hemming. That success is mirrored by the strong growth in our Women's business on NIKE.com, which exceeded both Men and the total NIKE Brand in the quarter. All told, our work, both in-store and online is helping to drive strong growth in our overall Women's business.\r\nNow let's talk about a few of our geographies. North America had a great quarter and another remarkable year. Revenues were up 14% for the quarter and 12% for the year despite the headwind from the West Coast port congestion. Growth in the quarter was driven by nearly every key category. We saw continued strong performance from DTC, which grew 13% in the quarter with NIKE.com growing 31%. This performance was complemented by strong executions with our wholesale partners such as the Fieldhouse with Dick's Sporting Goods, House of Hoops with Foot Locker and the Track Club with the Finish Line. \r\nIn Q4, we also remained focused on working through the impact of the West Coast port congestion by diverting some shipments to alternative ports and shipping select products via air freight. As expected, product flows began to normalize in Q4, but we expect it will take a couple of quarters before product flow fully returns to normal. That said, we continue to see great demand for our products in the marketplace and expect to efficiently move through the inventory and maintain a healthy pull market.\r\nWe continue to see incredible potential for growth in North America and the reason is simple and familiar. We remain focused on the consumer, delivering innovative products and services through compelling retail experiences. This allows us to expand the market while also taking market share.\r\nNow let's turn to Western Europe, where we're seeing broad-based demand with growth of 17% in the quarter and 21% for the year. Growth in the quarter and throughout the year was fueled by our continued efforts to transform the marketplace in line with the category offense. We saw strong growth across most key categories, led by Sportswear, Running, Women's Training and Basketball, and in the territories, particularly in AGS, that's Austria, Germany and Switzerland, as well as in the U.K. and Ireland. Our execution with our wholesale partners such as JD Sports, Foot Locker and Intersport all performed well in the quarter, as did our own DTC, which had revenue growth of 39%. \r\nThe momentum we've seen in fiscal year '15 in Western Europe, combined with the strength of the NIKE Brand, reinforces our view that there is tremendous growth potential in this important geography. Our focus on the consumer will continue to build on that momentum as we head into fiscal year '16 and beyond.\r\n \r\nNow let's turn to the emerging markets, where quarter 4, revenue declined 3% due in part to comparisons to strong World Cup results last year as well as actions we're taking in Mexico and Brazil to ensure a healthy marketplace. For the full year, revenue grew by 8%. For the quarter, we saw 7 of the 9 territories grow, with 6 growing at a double-digit rate. The NIKE Brand continues to be very strong in the emerging markets and our products are resonating with consumers across all territories.\r\nLet's take a closer look at 2 of these territories. In Mexico, we've been actively working to clear excess inventory, which resulted primarily from a distribution center transition in fiscal year '14. Our brand remains very strong, and we're seeing accelerated growth in retail sell-through. As a result, we're now returning to more normalized inventory levels as of the end of fiscal year '15. We continue to work with our wholesale partners to ensure a healthy pull market in Mexico and we feel confident that the market is now well-positioned for profitable growth.\r\nIn Brazil, Q4 revenue was down about 20%, reflecting comparisons to strong World Cup sales in the prior year as well as weak macroeconomic environment. At the same time, we continue to take steps to proactively manage the supply of product in the marketplace. The NIKE Brand remains incredibly strong in Brazil and we continue to see tremendous opportunity for sustainable, profitable growth. \r\nTo realize this opportunity, we are leveraging the category offense to segment and differentiate our points of distribution. We are confident that these steps will offer our consumers more premium and compelling retail experiences while increasing the productivity and profitability of the market for our wholesale partners and our business.\r\nAnd finally, in China, where Q4 revenue grew 20%, and we posted a full year growth of 19%. Our strong growth in the quarter was driven primarily by Running, Basketball and Sportswear. For our wholesale partners, doors that have been reprofiled continue to outperform the rest of the fleet. And in DTC, we saw a growth of 52%, with continued strong growth in our stores as well as online.\r\nIn China, the NIKE Brand is incredibly strong, which provided the foundation to reset the market in line with the category offense. Our strong results throughout fiscal year '15 demonstrated that our strategy has paid off. We returned to strong revenue growth. We've improved profitability and productivity for ourselves and our wholesale partners and inventory in the marketplace is healthy. Going forward, we will leverage the momentum from fiscal year '15 and continue to execute this consumer-led strategy to drive sustainable, profitable growth in this key geography.\r\nAt NIKE, viewing sport through the eyes of the consumer isn't just a strategy. It's our obsession. We know what our consumers want and we deliver it: innovative products, personalized services, unforgettable experiences and the inspiration to go after their biggest goals. And serving our consumers means we lead every day. Our consumer focus ensured we will be out in front in Q4. It ensured will be out in front in fiscal year '15, and it ensures we will be out in front in fiscal year '16 and beyond.\r\nBefore I hand over to Don, I also want to take a moment to thank him for his hard work and his partnership over the years. Don is an all-star CFO and a great leader for this company, who's work created a foundation of excellence for all those around him. I don't know where the CFO Hall of Fame is located, but Don, you deserve a plaque in it. Thanks for everything. Thanks for your friendship. Over to you.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Trevor. FY '15's results demonstrated our ability to deliver profitable growth even in a challenging macro environment. We did it by focusing on the fundamentals, building deep connections with consumers and delivering innovative products through compelling retail experiences. At the same time, we leveraged our global portfolio to manage risk while continuing to invest for future growth and profitability. Our ability to use all the levers in our business to drive growth and manage risk is one of our greatest advantages, and it's why we're confident in our ability to continue to deliver shareholder value on into the future.\r\nSo on to the details for Q4 and FY '15. Q4 revenue for NIKE, Inc. increased 5%, up 13% on a currency-neutral basis. For the full year, NIKE, Inc. revenue increased 10% to $30.6 billion. On a currency-neutral basis, both NIKE, Inc. and the NIKE Brand grew 14%, while Converse grew 21%. Growth in the NIKE Brand was broad-based across categories and driven by continued strong performance in 3 of our largest geographies: North America, Western Europe and China.\r\nAlso on a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand futures orders grew 13%, driven by a 5% increase in average selling price and an 8% increase in units. The growth reflects continued strong demand across the NIKE Brand portfolio, led by double-digit growth in North America, Western Europe and China. On a reported basis, futures grew 2%, reflecting weaker international currencies, particularly the euro, ruble, real and yen.\r\nFourth quarter diluted EPS increased 26% to $0.98, and full year diluted EPS rose 25% to $3.70, driven by revenue growth, gross margin expansion and a lower tax rate, partially offset by higher SG&A investments. The effects of FX on the quarter and the year were fairly modest as the negative impact of the stronger dollar was largely offset by our FX risk management.\r\nGross margin expanded 60 basis points in Q4 and 120 basis points for the full year. For both the quarter and the full year, margin expansion was primarily driven by higher average selling prices and continued growth in our higher-margin DTC business, partially offset by higher cost of goods due to labor inflation and higher logistics costs.\r\nFourth quarter demand creation was 7% below the prior year quarter, which included significant World Cup related expenses. For the full year, demand creation increased 6%, driven by support for key events and product launches, DTC and investments in sports marketing. \r\nOperating overhead increased 13% for the quarter and 16% for the full year. This reflected growth on our higher gross margin, higher cost DTC business as well as investments in operational infrastructure and digital, including consumer engagement.\r\nThe effective tax rate for FY '15 was 22.2%, lower than last year's 24% rate, primarily due to favorable resolution of tax audits across multiple jurisdictions. The rate was significantly lower in Q4, primarily due to adjustments to reduce tax expense recognized in interim quarters of FY '15 on intercompany transactions. We continue to deliver strong returns on capital as FY '15 ROIC reached 28.1%, up 360 basis points from the prior year. For the year, we returned $3.4 billion in cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends.\r\nAs of May 31, inventories were up 10%, primarily driven by business growth and the impact of port congestion in North America. As we discussed last quarter, we anticipate the flow of product in North America to return to normal in the first half of FY '16. We expect inventory levels to be somewhat elevated for the next several quarters as we work to rebalance supply and demand in the market.\r\nNow let's look at our performance by segment. North America delivered another remarkable year as FY '15 revenue grew 12% to $13.7 billion, the fifth consecutive year of double-digit revenue growth. Growth for the year was driven by higher revenues in nearly every key category, led by double-digit growth in Basketball, Sportswear and Women's Training. The growth also reflected strength in both sales to wholesale customers and DTC. Sustained, broad-based growth at this level in a market as developed as North America demonstrates both the tremendous strength of the NIKE Brand and the effectiveness of the category offense in expanding both the market and our market share.\r\nNorth America EBIT grew 18% for the full year, driven by strong revenue growth and gross margin expansion. \r\nWestern Europe also had a great year, as FY '15 revenue reached $5.7 billion, up 15% despite the weakness of the euro. On a currency-neutral basis, revenue grew 21% for FY '15 as every territory grew and we posted double-digit growth in every key category except Golf and Global Football, which grew at a high single-digit rate despite tough comparisons against the World Cup last year. \r\nWestern Europe EBIT increased 49% in FY '15, driven by revenue growth, gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.\r\nIn Central and Eastern Europe, FY '15 revenue grew 15% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by growth in every territory except Israel, and every key category except Action Sports and Global Football, which declined at a low-single digit rate, reflecting comparisons to last year's World Cup. On a reported basis, FY '15 revenue for CEE grew 2% and EBIT declined 11%, largely reflecting significantly weaker currencies, especially the ruble.\r\nIn FY '15, China returned to strong, profitable growth as revenues topped $3 billion, up 18% for the year. On a currency-neutral basis, FY '15 revenue grew 19%, driven by the ongoing strength of the brand, a more focused category assortment tailored for China and new retail formats, including NIKE.com. In addition to driving revenue growth, we've sharply reduced inventory levels in the market and significantly increased the productivity and profitability of retail for NIKE and our wholesale partners. FY '15 EBIT for China grew 22% due to strong revenue growth and expanding gross margins.\r\nIn Japan, currency-neutral revenue grew 9% for the year and 19% for the quarter, driven by strong growth in Sportswear, Basketball and Running. Reported results in Japan were significantly reduced by the weaker yen as FY '15 revenue declined 2% and EBIT fell 24%.\r\nIn our emerging markets geography, results were mixed. On a currency-neutral basis, FY '15 revenue increased 8%, but Q4 revenue fell 3%. Nearly every key category grew for the year and the quarter. Sportswear, Running and Basketball led the growth for the year, while Global Football declined for both periods as we lapped strong sales in advance of last year's World Cup. For the year and the quarter, we posted strong currency-neutral revenue growth in most territories, led by Soco, Pacific, Korea and Southeast Asia, while revenues in Mexico and Brazil declined for both periods.\r\nAs Trevor discussed, we're clearing the excess inventory in Mexico and feel confident the market is now positioned for profitable growth. In Brazil, a weakening macroeconomic environment and changes in the retail marketplace have led to a slowdown in our business. In response, we're taking strong steps to tighten the supply of products as we work to reprofile the marketplace along the lines of the category offense. We're confident we're taking the right actions now to position this market for renewed growth.\r\nFY '15 reported growth for our emerging markets geography was affected by both the marketplace actions we've taken in Mexico and Brazil as well as significant currency headwinds across the region. On a reported basis, FY '15 revenue decreased 1% and EBIT decreased 14%, reflecting lower gross margins and SG&A deleverage.\r\nConverse continues to deliver strong growth as FY '15 revenues reached nearly $2 billion, up 21% on a constant currency basis. The growth was driven by the conversion of several European markets to direct distribution and ongoing strength in the United States. On a reported basis, revenue grew 18% for the year, but only 6% for the quarter as we shifted customer shipments to Q3 in advance of a systems implementation.\r\nEBIT increased 4% for the year but declined 15% for the fourth quarter as revenue growth was offset by SG&A investments in market transitions, Converse and Converse IP enforcement as well as new systems and infrastructure. \r\nIn FY '15, NIKE, Inc. delivered strong growth and we had great momentum across the portfolio. Our FY '16 guidance reflects that momentum as well as continued investment in our growth strategies and operational capabilities. While currency markets remain volatile, our growth rate expectations for FY '16 are largely unchanged from what we shared last quarter even though we delivered stronger performance in FY '15 than we expected 90 days ago. \r\nSpecifically, for FY '16, we expect reported revenue growth at a mid-single-digit rate, reflecting low-double digit growth on a currency-neutral basis, partially offset by the impact of the stronger dollar. For Q1, we expect low single-digit reported revenue growth, roughly in line with reported futures growth as FX comparisons are more challenging in the first half of the fiscal year.\r\nWe expect gross margin for Q1 and the full year to expand by about 50 basis points, driven by higher average selling prices and rapid growth in our DTC business, including NIKE.com. We also expect to see some benefit from lower oil prices. However, these upsides will be partially offset by ongoing labor cost inflation, higher prices for some raw materials and FX headwinds. For SG&A, including both demand creation and operating overhead, we expect full year growth at a mid-single-digit rate.\r\nFor Q1, we expect growth slightly lower than the full year rate as we anniversary World Cup investments in the first quarter of FY '15. We anticipate other income will have a more meaningful impact on our FY '16 results than we've seen historically as a portion of our expected FX hedge gains will be reported in this line item. We currently expect other income will be approximately $50 million for each quarter. For FY '16, we expect the effective tax rate will be approximately 24%.\r\nBefore I open the call to questions, I'd like to share a few reflections on my nearly 16 years with NIKE. First, I'd like to thank Mark and Trevor for their kind words today as well as their support and partnership over the years. It's been a privilege to work closely with you both, as well as the rest of the tremendously talented leadership team that has led and will continue to lead NIKE into the future. \r\n  \r\nI'm incredibly proud of the results we've delivered and the value we've created for our shareholders. The company today is stronger, more diversified, more profitable and better positioned to drive growth than at any time in our history. Our brands are deeply connected with consumers around the world. We're delivering unmatched innovation and we've become highly effective at creating compelling retail experiences online and in-store across wholesale and DTC. We're better operators than we've ever been and our people are the most talented the industry. That's why I know NIKE will continue to drive profitable growth and shareholder value for years to come.\r\nFinally, I'd like to congratulate Andy on his promotion to the CFO role. I've worked closely with him over the last 8 years and have great confidence in his ability to help lead the company toward its full potential. Andy is a strategic leader, with a clear passion for our brands, our business and, most importantly, delivering strong results for our shareholders. And he'll be supported by the finest team of financial executives I know. While it won't be easy to depart at the end of October, I know I leave the company and the finance function in good shape and in good hands. \r\nThank you, and now we'd like to open it up for questions.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Kelley Hall (Executives)】\nThank you, operator. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss NIKE's fiscal 2015 fourth quarter results. As the operator indicated, participants on today's call may discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the appropriate reconciliations in our press release, which was issued about an hour ago, and at our website, investors.nike.com.\r\nJoining us on today's call will be NIKE, Inc. President and CEO, Mark Parker; followed by Trevor Edwards, President of the NIKE Brand. And finally, Don Blair, in his final earnings call, as our Chief Financial Officer, will give you an overview of our financial results. Following their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you for your cooperation on this. \r\nI'll now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc. President and CEO, Mark Parker.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Mark Parker (Executives)】\nThank you, Kelley, and hello, everyone. Fiscal year '15 was an outstanding year for NIKE, Inc. We've shown once again that NIKE is a growth company. \r\nHere are the fiscal '15 highlights. NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 10% to $30.6 billion despite significant FX headwinds. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 14%. Gross margin increased 120 basis points to 46%. Earnings per share rose 25% to $3.70 and we delivered ROIC of 28%. These are the quality results that our shareholders have come to expect from us and that we demand from ourselves.\r\nOne of the reasons we're able to deliver results like these are the talented people who work at NIKE around the world. So before going on into the detail on our results, I'd like to thank one of those talented leaders, and that's Don Blair. As you all know, this will be Don's last earnings call with NIKE. And if you're keeping track, it's 63 calls. \r\nDuring my tenure as CEO and before that as Co-President, Don has served as a trusted advisor and a valued business partner. He has helped lead the company through great times and challenging times, always with a calm focus and level of discipline that creates confidence and insures we continue to move forward. \r\nDon will always be remembered as the creator of our long-term financial model, which guides our financial planning to this day. But more than that, Don will be remembered for the talented leaders he has developed over the years, both within finance and across the company.\r\nI want to thank Don for his leadership and dedication to NIKE over the last 15 years, and wish him the very best in his future endeavors. Don's successor, Andy Campion, is a testament to Don's commitment to developing talent. Andy has been a great leader during his 8 years with NIKE, helping to develop the strategy that will drive NIKE's growth for years to come, and I'm confident that Andy will continue to build on the strong foundation Don has set for the company as we strive toward our full potential. Andy will assume the CFO role on August 1 and will join us on the next earnings call.\r\nSo while I'm proud of the results we delivered this last year, what sets NIKE apart is our ability to deliver sustainable, profitable growth year in and year out. It is our proven track record of driving growth under a variety of macroeconomic conditions that gives us the confidence we can deliver growth for years to come. This past fiscal year, we managed through a volatile currency environment and sharpened our focus in key markets, and we will continue to drive that same level of discipline and focus as we look ahead to fiscal year '16.\r\nAs we have consistently done in the past, we will leverage the power of the NIKE portfolio to drive growth. We have demonstrated time and again that our diverse portfolio of brands, categories, geographies and products is a competitive advantage that allows us to serve our consumer and drive growth better than anyone else. And you can expect us to leverage our portfolio to further unlock growth around the world to expand the market and increase share. And we'll do this by staying true to our commitment to the athlete and our commitment to innovation. \r\nI recently sat with the innovation teams for an in-depth review of our future product concepts, and I can tell you, I am incredibly energized by what's to come. Today we are pushing ourselves to create products and experiences that consumers want and some they never thought possible. The scale and pace at which we are bringing new innovations to market is unprecedented. Let me share a few examples. \r\nFlyknit, of course, continues to be one of NIKE's great breakthroughs for the athlete and for our company. It's created a whole new model for design and manufacturing. Instead of engineering down to the piece, we can now engineer it down to the pixel to enhance performance, aesthetics and sustainability. And the most exciting part is we're just discovering new ways to use it every day. We've advanced Flyknit into other sports over the past few years, but there's no doubt last summer's World Cup was the launching pad for Flyknit in Global Football. More than 1/3 of the players chose to wear the Magista, our first Flyknit boot, including Mario Götze, who scored the winning goal in the World Cup final. \r\nWhen you look across our business, Flyknit's dynamic strength and lightweight benefits have been applied across our key performance categories: Running, Basketball, Men's and Women's Training as well as into premium Sportswear. \r\nWith the success of Flyknit, we've been inspired to engineer new types of materials like Flyweave. This innovative performance weaving process pushes the limits of lightweight with superior strength, and it was introduced this year with the Jordan 29. And just a few days ago, we revealed the newest signature shoe from Kevin Durant, the KD8, which utilizes this incredible technology. I'm very excited about the potential for Flyweave, so keep an eye out for further innovation in this area.\r\nWe not only deliver new breakthroughs, but we also push ourselves to reinvent our most iconic products. Products in our Running category are a great example. This year, we matched Zoom Air in its 20th year with the Pegasus 31 to create the fastest, most responsive Pegasus to date. It proves that much better does not always have to be entirely new. \r\nWe also continue to diversify one of our greatest collections of apparel technologies, Dri-FIT. Dri-FIT is the foundation for everything from shirts to tights, to socks, and it adapts to any athlete need. Strong performance this year included Nike Pro Hyperwarm, Running Dri-FIT Knit and Running Dri-FIT Hypercool. \r\nOne of this year's greatest Dri-FIT innovations was with the Nike Pro Bra Collection. With the broadest assortment of styles and sizes, we're able to provide the athlete with the right fit and support for any type of training or sports.\r\nFinally, Dri-FIT also forms the basis for our most advanced NCAA basketball uniforms ever. Two of our longstanding partners, Duke and UConn, won the respective men's and women's national championships wearing the Nike Hyper Elite uniform. Our uniforms weigh only 11.4 ounces, and we have set every detail from vented waistbands to laser perforations, which enhance cooling and increase mobility. The Hyper Elite truly sets the standard for basketball apparel. \r\nIt is examples like these that makes me so excited to bring the full power of NIKE's innovation and creativity to the NBA. With Nike, Jordan and Converse, we can't wait to help grow the game of Basketball even farther across our entire global reach. \r\nAt NIKE, innovation comes in many forms and our growing digital ecosystem is a great example. Consumers are increasingly connected and utilizing premium, personal digital services. Digital is an accelerator of growth that is shaping everything we do, from building deep connections to consumers with digital services and communities to driving rapid expansion of our e-commerce business. This is all made possible because NIKE is one of the world's most engaged brands online. It's where we connect with the consumer 1-to-1 and it's where we connect people to one another. And we're constantly looking for new ways to seamlessly connect social platforms to commerce.\r\nEarlier this quarter, for example, Nike Women launched the Instagram shop, a new tool that allows users to click a photo and be taken directly to NIKE.com product pages. And just last week, we announced that we are one of the first partners to offer curated product collections through Twitter. And there are many more exciting opportunities to come in this space as the power of the NIKE Brand creates strong demand from consumers any time, anywhere on any platform.\r\nWe deepen our relationship with consumers through services like Nike+ Run Club and Nike+ Training Club that inspire and enable them to do more and get better. Our Nike+ Training Club app continues to build a motivated community of devoted athletes and now features 135 workouts and is available in 17 languages. Access for NIKE.com to Nike+ Run Club training plans brings together the best Nike expert running guidance to one place. There's great potential here to connect more runners to the product they need to meet their goals. And in April, we unveiled a Nike Trainer's Hub that unites the global network of elite trainers to help every athlete reach their peak potential.\r\nWe connect, motivate and inspire our community of members with great products and services because ultimately, what sets NIKE apart is our innovative product, and e-commerce is rapidly expanding our ability to serve consumers with products for any sport all over the world. \r\nFiscal '15 was a great year for NIKE.com. We delivered 51% revenue growth in Q4 with 55% growth for the full year. We saw increases in both traffic and conversion, fueled by our investments in critical infrastructure to improve the consumer experience on both desktop and mobile. And as I mentioned last quarter, our traffic on mobile has exceeded traffic on desktop, making it a very sharp point for consumer engagement going forward. \r\nI'm proud to say our e-commerce business surpassed $1 billion in revenue this past year, a fantastic achievement from all of our teams. But really, we're just scratching the surface of our potential in this area. Global consumer spending through e-commerce exceeds $1 trillion, a significant portion of which is done on mobile devices. Tremendous opportunity ahead for us in e-commerce.\r\nWhat I just recapped is by no means an exhausted list, but it clearly shows how much ground this company can cover in just 1 year. And while we're pleased with this year's results, at NIKE, we're always moving forward. We are relentless in our pursuit to get better and we see opportunities that no one else can. And most importantly, we have the resources and the talented team to deliver. \r\nFiscal '16 will be no different. We have great momentum and we will continue to drive it by growing our largest categories such as Running, Basketball, Football and our geographies such as North America, Western Europe and China. And by unlocking the areas with the greatest potential for growth such as Women's, Young Athletes and apparel, and also by accelerating new opportunities such as breakthrough technologies and product in advanced manufacturing and digital. \r\nWe have one of the strongest brands in the world with the world of opportunities still ahead. And that's why fiscal '16 will be our best year yet.\r\nThanks, and now here's Trevor.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Trevor Edwards (Executives)】\nThanks, Mark. The NIKE Brand closed the year with a strong finish, demonstrating yet again the power of the category offense to drive growth. On a constant currency basis, NIKE Brand revenue grew 13% for the quarter. For the year, revenue was up 14%, with double-digit growth in North America, both European geographies and China. \r\nNIKE Brand DTC revenue was up 27% for the quarter. For the year, DTC revenue was up 29%, driven by comp store growth of 16%, online growth of 59% and new stores. And finally, global futures accelerated to 13%, reflecting continued strong demand. \r\nThe success in our business is a natural outcome of putting the consumer at the center of everything we do. Our connection with consumers strengthens our brand every day from our own retail to wholesale partners, from in-store to online, from digital experiences to unforgettable live events. It's those deep and authentic connections that power the NIKE Brand around the world.\r\nWithin our category offense, we often talk about Amplify -- our Amplify strategy to compete, train and express. Sportswear represents the express portion of that equation, where consumers express their love and passion for the game with premium sports-inspired products. Sportswear is a key complement to the product assortment for our performance categories, offering an opportunity to elevate the design and technical innovation in traditional Sportswear styles while also creating new ones. This drove tremendous growth in the Sportswear in fiscal year '15, which was up 20% for the year.\r\nNow let's turn to a few of our performance categories. First, I'll start with Running. By serving our consumers through product innovation and consumer engagement, we drove growth in this important category with revenue up 9% for the year to nearly $5 billion. Our premium performance footwear continues to resonate with runners, led by the Air Zoom Pegasus 31 and the FlyKnit Lunar 3, and our premium Sportswear styles such as the Air Max 1 and the Roshe, also continued to drive growth. \r\nWe saw a return to growth in our core Running footwear across all markets, including North America. Core Running footwear consists of our products at mid-tier price zones. This return to growth was led by core performance styles like the Downshifter and the Wind Flow, which features Zoom Air technology. \r\nAs we continued to drive innovation, Running apparel was once again a key growth driver, led by the continued success of our Dri-FIT Knit tops and our Epic Lux tights. \r\nAnd more than ever, we're expanding our overall Running business by inspiring new generations of runners every day. As Mark discussed, giving runners the knowledge and tools they need through digital services has helped to create deeper, meaningful relationships. The opportunities to build new connections with our Nike+ community are virtually unlimited, as we add even more exclusive experiences like special product launches and Running events.\r\nNike Basketball, which in fiscal year '15, grew 21% to nearly $4 billion. Our Basketball business fueled the strength of our brand and our product innovation has never been stronger. \r\nThis year, as always, we launched incredibly innovative products for our consumers. Nike Basketball introduced great footwear such as the LeBron 12, completely redesigned to deliver precision and explosive performance, and the KYRIE 1, the first signature shoe for this dynamic and exciting young player. And in the Jordan Brand, we introduced the Air Jordan 29, the lightest Air Jordan performance shoe ever, and the Super.Fly 3, which employs NIKE's Zoom technology for lightweight, durable cushioning. \r\nWhat's more, every year, Nike Basketball and the Jordan Brand put on great consumer experiences and fiscal year '15 was no exception. Standout examples include last quarter's NBA All-Star weekend in New York and the Nike World Basketball Festival in Spain last September was a great example. These events showcase the tremendous combined power of the 2 great basketball brands, something only Nike can offer. \r\nNike Basketball and Jordan are driving the kind of energy that excites current fans and brings in new ones, growing the market today and into the future. And as Mark mentioned, our partnership with the NBA gives us tremendous opportunity to grow this sport. It's a platform for true innovation, not just for our products, but also for the many ways we can serve our consumers. This partnership will let us share our passion for Basketball in exciting places like Rio to Beijing, to Barcelona. The energy around Basketball is at an all-time high, and we're excited to accelerate its growth around the globe.\r\nFinally, our Women's business continues to drive strong growth. For the year, revenue grew 20% to nearly $6 billion. The strong growth in our Women's business is driven by the innovation and style we bring to the products that matter most to these athletes. Key apparel styles such as the Nike Pro Bra Collection and broad assortments of tights are resonating strongly with consumers and creating excitement in the marketplace. In Q4, we released our biggest ever market initiative for women called Better For It, which in just 2 months, has totaled more than 18 million online views. Better For It resonated with consumers because it wasn't just a campaign. It was a call to action for all athletes to push themselves to be their best. And it was served by the global community of women who interact with NIKE and each other every day for inspiration.\r\nOur new Women's only door in London, along with our newly reopened Santa Monica store, exemplify the focus on providing products and services specifically for women. We've also continued to increase the number of stores with premium services such as bra fitting, gait analysis and pant hemming. That success is mirrored by the strong growth in our Women's business on NIKE.com, which exceeded both Men and the total NIKE Brand in the quarter. All told, our work, both in-store and online is helping to drive strong growth in our overall Women's business.\r\nNow let's talk about a few of our geographies. North America had a great quarter and another remarkable year. Revenues were up 14% for the quarter and 12% for the year despite the headwind from the West Coast port congestion. Growth in the quarter was driven by nearly every key category. We saw continued strong performance from DTC, which grew 13% in the quarter with NIKE.com growing 31%. This performance was complemented by strong executions with our wholesale partners such as the Fieldhouse with Dick's Sporting Goods, House of Hoops with Foot Locker and the Track Club with the Finish Line. \r\nIn Q4, we also remained focused on working through the impact of the West Coast port congestion by diverting some shipments to alternative ports and shipping select products via air freight. As expected, product flows began to normalize in Q4, but we expect it will take a couple of quarters before product flow fully returns to normal. That said, we continue to see great demand for our products in the marketplace and expect to efficiently move through the inventory and maintain a healthy pull market.\r\nWe continue to see incredible potential for growth in North America and the reason is simple and familiar. We remain focused on the consumer, delivering innovative products and services through compelling retail experiences. This allows us to expand the market while also taking market share.\r\nNow let's turn to Western Europe, where we're seeing broad-based demand with growth of 17% in the quarter and 21% for the year. Growth in the quarter and throughout the year was fueled by our continued efforts to transform the marketplace in line with the category offense. We saw strong growth across most key categories, led by Sportswear, Running, Women's Training and Basketball, and in the territories, particularly in AGS, that's Austria, Germany and Switzerland, as well as in the U.K. and Ireland. Our execution with our wholesale partners such as JD Sports, Foot Locker and Intersport all performed well in the quarter, as did our own DTC, which had revenue growth of 39%. \r\nThe momentum we've seen in fiscal year '15 in Western Europe, combined with the strength of the NIKE Brand, reinforces our view that there is tremendous growth potential in this important geography. Our focus on the consumer will continue to build on that momentum as we head into fiscal year '16 and beyond.\r\n \r\nNow let's turn to the emerging markets, where quarter 4, revenue declined 3% due in part to comparisons to strong World Cup results last year as well as actions we're taking in Mexico and Brazil to ensure a healthy marketplace. For the full year, revenue grew by 8%. For the quarter, we saw 7 of the 9 territories grow, with 6 growing at a double-digit rate. The NIKE Brand continues to be very strong in the emerging markets and our products are resonating with consumers across all territories.\r\nLet's take a closer look at 2 of these territories. In Mexico, we've been actively working to clear excess inventory, which resulted primarily from a distribution center transition in fiscal year '14. Our brand remains very strong, and we're seeing accelerated growth in retail sell-through. As a result, we're now returning to more normalized inventory levels as of the end of fiscal year '15. We continue to work with our wholesale partners to ensure a healthy pull market in Mexico and we feel confident that the market is now well-positioned for profitable growth.\r\nIn Brazil, Q4 revenue was down about 20%, reflecting comparisons to strong World Cup sales in the prior year as well as weak macroeconomic environment. At the same time, we continue to take steps to proactively manage the supply of product in the marketplace. The NIKE Brand remains incredibly strong in Brazil and we continue to see tremendous opportunity for sustainable, profitable growth. \r\nTo realize this opportunity, we are leveraging the category offense to segment and differentiate our points of distribution. We are confident that these steps will offer our consumers more premium and compelling retail experiences while increasing the productivity and profitability of the market for our wholesale partners and our business.\r\nAnd finally, in China, where Q4 revenue grew 20%, and we posted a full year growth of 19%. Our strong growth in the quarter was driven primarily by Running, Basketball and Sportswear. For our wholesale partners, doors that have been reprofiled continue to outperform the rest of the fleet. And in DTC, we saw a growth of 52%, with continued strong growth in our stores as well as online.\r\nIn China, the NIKE Brand is incredibly strong, which provided the foundation to reset the market in line with the category offense. Our strong results throughout fiscal year '15 demonstrated that our strategy has paid off. We returned to strong revenue growth. We've improved profitability and productivity for ourselves and our wholesale partners and inventory in the marketplace is healthy. Going forward, we will leverage the momentum from fiscal year '15 and continue to execute this consumer-led strategy to drive sustainable, profitable growth in this key geography.\r\nAt NIKE, viewing sport through the eyes of the consumer isn't just a strategy. It's our obsession. We know what our consumers want and we deliver it: innovative products, personalized services, unforgettable experiences and the inspiration to go after their biggest goals. And serving our consumers means we lead every day. Our consumer focus ensured we will be out in front in Q4. It ensured will be out in front in fiscal year '15, and it ensures we will be out in front in fiscal year '16 and beyond.\r\nBefore I hand over to Don, I also want to take a moment to thank him for his hard work and his partnership over the years. Don is an all-star CFO and a great leader for this company, who's work created a foundation of excellence for all those around him. I don't know where the CFO Hall of Fame is located, but Don, you deserve a plaque in it. Thanks for everything. Thanks for your friendship. Over to you.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Donald Blair (Executives)】\nThank you, Trevor. FY '15's results demonstrated our ability to deliver profitable growth even in a challenging macro environment. We did it by focusing on the fundamentals, building deep connections with consumers and delivering innovative products through compelling retail experiences. At the same time, we leveraged our global portfolio to manage risk while continuing to invest for future growth and profitability. Our ability to use all the levers in our business to drive growth and manage risk is one of our greatest advantages, and it's why we're confident in our ability to continue to deliver shareholder value on into the future.\r\nSo on to the details for Q4 and FY '15. Q4 revenue for NIKE, Inc. increased 5%, up 13% on a currency-neutral basis. For the full year, NIKE, Inc. revenue increased 10% to $30.6 billion. On a currency-neutral basis, both NIKE, Inc. and the NIKE Brand grew 14%, while Converse grew 21%. Growth in the NIKE Brand was broad-based across categories and driven by continued strong performance in 3 of our largest geographies: North America, Western Europe and China.\r\nAlso on a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand futures orders grew 13%, driven by a 5% increase in average selling price and an 8% increase in units. The growth reflects continued strong demand across the NIKE Brand portfolio, led by double-digit growth in North America, Western Europe and China. On a reported basis, futures grew 2%, reflecting weaker international currencies, particularly the euro, ruble, real and yen.\r\nFourth quarter diluted EPS increased 26% to $0.98, and full year diluted EPS rose 25% to $3.70, driven by revenue growth, gross margin expansion and a lower tax rate, partially offset by higher SG&A investments. The effects of FX on the quarter and the year were fairly modest as the negative impact of the stronger dollar was largely offset by our FX risk management.\r\nGross margin expanded 60 basis points in Q4 and 120 basis points for the full year. For both the quarter and the full year, margin expansion was primarily driven by higher average selling prices and continued growth in our higher-margin DTC business, partially offset by higher cost of goods due to labor inflation and higher logistics costs.\r\nFourth quarter demand creation was 7% below the prior year quarter, which included significant World Cup related expenses. For the full year, demand creation increased 6%, driven by support for key events and product launches, DTC and investments in sports marketing. \r\nOperating overhead increased 13% for the quarter and 16% for the full year. This reflected growth on our higher gross margin, higher cost DTC business as well as investments in operational infrastructure and digital, including consumer engagement.\r\nThe effective tax rate for FY '15 was 22.2%, lower than last year's 24% rate, primarily due to favorable resolution of tax audits across multiple jurisdictions. The rate was significantly lower in Q4, primarily due to adjustments to reduce tax expense recognized in interim quarters of FY '15 on intercompany transactions. We continue to deliver strong returns on capital as FY '15 ROIC reached 28.1%, up 360 basis points from the prior year. For the year, we returned $3.4 billion in cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends.\r\nAs of May 31, inventories were up 10%, primarily driven by business growth and the impact of port congestion in North America. As we discussed last quarter, we anticipate the flow of product in North America to return to normal in the first half of FY '16. We expect inventory levels to be somewhat elevated for the next several quarters as we work to rebalance supply and demand in the market.\r\nNow let's look at our performance by segment. North America delivered another remarkable year as FY '15 revenue grew 12% to $13.7 billion, the fifth consecutive year of double-digit revenue growth. Growth for the year was driven by higher revenues in nearly every key category, led by double-digit growth in Basketball, Sportswear and Women's Training. The growth also reflected strength in both sales to wholesale customers and DTC. Sustained, broad-based growth at this level in a market as developed as North America demonstrates both the tremendous strength of the NIKE Brand and the effectiveness of the category offense in expanding both the market and our market share.\r\nNorth America EBIT grew 18% for the full year, driven by strong revenue growth and gross margin expansion. \r\nWestern Europe also had a great year, as FY '15 revenue reached $5.7 billion, up 15% despite the weakness of the euro. On a currency-neutral basis, revenue grew 21% for FY '15 as every territory grew and we posted double-digit growth in every key category except Golf and Global Football, which grew at a high single-digit rate despite tough comparisons against the World Cup last year. \r\nWestern Europe EBIT increased 49% in FY '15, driven by revenue growth, gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.\r\nIn Central and Eastern Europe, FY '15 revenue grew 15% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by growth in every territory except Israel, and every key category except Action Sports and Global Football, which declined at a low-single digit rate, reflecting comparisons to last year's World Cup. On a reported basis, FY '15 revenue for CEE grew 2% and EBIT declined 11%, largely reflecting significantly weaker currencies, especially the ruble.\r\nIn FY '15, China returned to strong, profitable growth as revenues topped $3 billion, up 18% for the year. On a currency-neutral basis, FY '15 revenue grew 19%, driven by the ongoing strength of the brand, a more focused category assortment tailored for China and new retail formats, including NIKE.com. In addition to driving revenue growth, we've sharply reduced inventory levels in the market and significantly increased the productivity and profitability of retail for NIKE and our wholesale partners. FY '15 EBIT for China grew 22% due to strong revenue growth and expanding gross margins.\r\nIn Japan, currency-neutral revenue grew 9% for the year and 19% for the quarter, driven by strong growth in Sportswear, Basketball and Running. Reported results in Japan were significantly reduced by the weaker yen as FY '15 revenue declined 2% and EBIT fell 24%.\r\nIn our emerging markets geography, results were mixed. On a currency-neutral basis, FY '15 revenue increased 8%, but Q4 revenue fell 3%. Nearly every key category grew for the year and the quarter. Sportswear, Running and Basketball led the growth for the year, while Global Football declined for both periods as we lapped strong sales in advance of last year's World Cup. For the year and the quarter, we posted strong currency-neutral revenue growth in most territories, led by Soco, Pacific, Korea and Southeast Asia, while revenues in Mexico and Brazil declined for both periods.\r\nAs Trevor discussed, we're clearing the excess inventory in Mexico and feel confident the market is now positioned for profitable growth. In Brazil, a weakening macroeconomic environment and changes in the retail marketplace have led to a slowdown in our business. In response, we're taking strong steps to tighten the supply of products as we work to reprofile the marketplace along the lines of the category offense. We're confident we're taking the right actions now to position this market for renewed growth.\r\nFY '15 reported growth for our emerging markets geography was affected by both the marketplace actions we've taken in Mexico and Brazil as well as significant currency headwinds across the region. On a reported basis, FY '15 revenue decreased 1% and EBIT decreased 14%, reflecting lower gross margins and SG&A deleverage.\r\nConverse continues to deliver strong growth as FY '15 revenues reached nearly $2 billion, up 21% on a constant currency basis. The growth was driven by the conversion of several European markets to direct distribution and ongoing strength in the United States. On a reported basis, revenue grew 18% for the year, but only 6% for the quarter as we shifted customer shipments to Q3 in advance of a systems implementation.\r\nEBIT increased 4% for the year but declined 15% for the fourth quarter as revenue growth was offset by SG&A investments in market transitions, Converse and Converse IP enforcement as well as new systems and infrastructure. \r\nIn FY '15, NIKE, Inc. delivered strong growth and we had great momentum across the portfolio. Our FY '16 guidance reflects that momentum as well as continued investment in our growth strategies and operational capabilities. While currency markets remain volatile, our growth rate expectations for FY '16 are largely unchanged from what we shared last quarter even though we delivered stronger performance in FY '15 than we expected 90 days ago. \r\nSpecifically, for FY '16, we expect reported revenue growth at a mid-single-digit rate, reflecting low-double digit growth on a currency-neutral basis, partially offset by the impact of the stronger dollar. For Q1, we expect low single-digit reported revenue growth, roughly in line with reported futures growth as FX comparisons are more challenging in the first half of the fiscal year.\r\nWe expect gross margin for Q1 and the full year to expand by about 50 basis points, driven by higher average selling prices and rapid growth in our DTC business, including NIKE.com. We also expect to see some benefit from lower oil prices. However, these upsides will be partially offset by ongoing labor cost inflation, higher prices for some raw materials and FX headwinds. For SG&A, including both demand creation and operating overhead, we expect full year growth at a mid-single-digit rate.\r\nFor Q1, we expect growth slightly lower than the full year rate as we anniversary World Cup investments in the first quarter of FY '15. We anticipate other income will have a more meaningful impact on our FY '16 results than we've seen historically as a portion of our expected FX hedge gains will be reported in this line item. We currently expect other income will be approximately $50 million for each quarter. For FY '16, we expect the effective tax rate will be approximately 24%.\r\nBefore I open the call to questions, I'd like to share a few reflections on my nearly 16 years with NIKE. First, I'd like to thank Mark and Trevor for their kind words today as well as their support and partnership over the years. It's been a privilege to work closely with you both, as well as the rest of the tremendously talented leadership team that has led and will continue to lead NIKE into the future. \r\n  \r\nI'm incredibly proud of the results we've delivered and the value we've created for our shareholders. The company today is stronger, more diversified, more profitable and better positioned to drive growth than at any time in our history. Our brands are deeply connected with consumers around the world. We're delivering unmatched innovation and we've become highly effective at creating compelling retail experiences online and in-store across wholesale and DTC. We're better operators than we've ever been and our people are the most talented the industry. That's why I know NIKE will continue to drive profitable growth and shareholder value for years to come.\r\nFinally, I'd like to congratulate Andy on his promotion to the CFO role. I've worked closely with him over the last 8 years and have great confidence in his ability to help lead the company toward its full potential. Andy is a strategic leader, with a clear passion for our brands, our business and, most importantly, delivering strong results for our shareholders. And he'll be supported by the finest team of financial executives I know. While it won't be easy to depart at the end of October, I know I leave the company and the finance function in good shape and in good hands. \r\nThank you, and now we'd like to open it up for questions.",
      "transcript_text3": "Don, congratulations. Thanks for everything. Best of luck.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Bob.\n\n---\n\nI guess the question that I have is on the Running category. I just wondered if we could just have a little bit more of a discussion around -- the core, I think has gotten better, but just an update on the competitive set and sort of how you guys are feeling about that category as we look forward.\n\n---\n\nYes, Bob. Actually, I feel really good about the Running category. For the year, the Running category actually grew 9% and what we saw certainly in the fourth quarter, we saw actually strong double-digit growth in most of our geographies from North America to Europe to China. And what we are doing very well is we are connecting very well with runners in the marketplace, so we continue to feel very confident about the business. And at the same time, what we have seen is the strengthening in the core, as we discussed, which is really about the mid-price -- the mid-priced tier zone. And what we've done there is certainly, we've gone in and zoned in, and we've always talk about diving in deeper. That's a great example. We've gone in deeper and focused on that. At the same time, I feel very confident about the innovation that is coming and that has been delivered and continues to be in the pipeline for Running. So overall, I'm very confident about the Running business. There's always room for opportunity and more growth and obviously, for us to continue to excite our consumers. But I certainly feel positive about it.\n\n---\n\nI'm just going to jump in, too. And I want to shout out Nike Running apparel as well, which has had an incredible run this past year, and that momentum continues into fiscal '16. And as I said before, I was sitting through the innovation, category-based innovation meetings recently, and our innovation pipeline for Running leading up to Rio is incredibly strong. So very bullish on that core category for NIKE.\n\n---\n\nAnd I guess just -- I guess, could you elaborate a little bit -- my second question would be on the NBA -- the deal that you struck with the NBA? And I was wondering, maybe we could just put Don on the spot, he could give his pick for the #1 spot tonight.\n\n---\n\nIt's not going to be my hometown, Sixers, I don't think.\n\n---\n\nWell, first of all, I'm going to jump in on the NBA. Very, very excited about our partnership with the NBA. As you know, there's great energy in the sport globally. We have very progressive leadership under Adam Silver, really strong leadership there. Adam and his team, the owners have an appetite to really innovate and advance the game, which is perfect for us. We're thrilled to be a part of that. We have 3 incredible brands that can play in this space, of course, Nike, Jordan and Converse. We have on-court brand exposure head-to-toe for the first time, and that's across the NBA, the WNBA, the All-Star Games, the D-League. It's going to be a great opportunity to showcase our leadership in this critical category for us, not just here in the U.S., but globally.\n\n---\n\nMy question, my first question is on gross margins. In fiscal year '16 the guidance that you gave today, can you give us an idea on just overall manufacturing costs and how they're coming into play into cost of goods sold, just given all the initiatives you have with automation and Flyknit and everything else?\n\n---\n\nSure. Well, we are starting to see some benefits out of that program. And as you know, we've been on a long journey of working with our factory partners to improve costs in the factory system and maintain the innovation and the quality of our products. So we've been doing things that are more evolutionary like lean manufacturing and just factory efficiency types of initiatives with them all the way, through breakthrough things like Flyknit. So we've been getting benefits for quite some time. We are starting to see some of the newer technologies coming onstream now. And so that's a part of the equation for FY '16. At this stage, there's lots of other factors. There are some headwinds out there, of course, with labor inflation and FX, but on the flip side, we've done a pretty consistent job of raising average gross selling prices, our DTC business of course, is accretive. So overall, on margin, we're pretty confident we can keep moving margin forward.\n\n---\n\nAnd then my second question is on SG&A. Going again on your guidance, they had mid-single-digit growth for fiscal year '16. I know fiscal year '15 has at least 1 quarter of Olympic spend or more, because we're entering into an Olympic year. So can you help us understand better how we should think about demand creation and corporate overhead and the breakdown of that for fiscal year '16?\n\n---\n\nWell, I don't want to get into too much granularity here because we don't normally provide that level of granularity. And as we've talked about in the last couple of calls, Kate, there's really been an evolution of how we think about consumer engagement. And in today's world, where so much of our marketing is digital, we are investing quite a bit in digital consumer engagement, and a lot of those costs fall into our operating overhead lines. So there's been a little bit of a blurring of the nature of those costs. Obviously, from an accounting standpoint, there's still clarity of it. But from a business standpoint, a lot of the things that we use to drive our business and consumer engagements are actually falling into the operating overhead lines.\n\n---\n\nI wanted to ask a question about kind of on the topic of the geographic evolution of the supply chain. There's a pretty important vote through the Senate yesterday, and you guys have made some comments publicly maybe about some manufacturing eventually coming back. But how do you think about some of these recent developments, legislative developments and your overall supply chain as you look out in the coming years and the potential to even bring -- to put some production into the U.S. and North America?\n\n---\n\nYes, well, first of all, the passing of the TPA was obviously an important step toward what we hope is the final approval of TPP. And as we've said before, as you know, this will help us to accelerate the work that we're doing with advanced manufacturing, will help us expand our business overall. I think certainly, give us an opportunity to build local manufacturing here in the United States, can put us closer to market, advance some of the innovation, particularly in the area of customization. We are in the middle -- Don has mentioned this briefly, but scaling our advanced manufacturing initiatives, which we've really been working on over the past 3 or 4 years. So you're going to start to see those scale. But the opportunity to get some -- translate some duty relief into investing in our advanced manufacturing supply chain efforts here in the United States is going to be significant. We hope, I mean that's our goal, so that the idea is that, that will accelerate and we'll see some real benefits from that. I think you're going to see the overall supply chain geographically shift a bit here and there, with the advancements of new manufacturing, innovation that is a major priority for NIKE. It will give us the flexibility to create more localized manufacturing over time. And that will put us closer to market, and again, allow us to advance products, particularly in the customization area, and to meet more local demand as well.\n\n---\n\nThe point I would make, too, Omar, is we are really encouraged by the passage of TPA. We still have a little bit of a ways to go from a timing standpoint to see TPP taken up by the Congress. And then of course, once it were implemented, it would take some time for those duty changes to be phased in.\n\n---\n\nAnd is the right way to think about it, any sort of potential duty savings, kind of being reinvested back into the supply chain or other areas of the business? Or is this -- is it more of a sustainable kind of opportunity on the margin line?\n\n---\n\nI think it's way too early to say on that.\n\n---\n\nDon, congratulations. Best wishes.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Omar.\n\n---\n\nSo just to kind of look ahead and put things together. If top line growth remained at least high single digits, and then you take the combination of Europe and China margin recapture and some increased scale with both e-commerce and Flyknit, is there anything structurally -- I guess my question is there anything structurally preventing a high teens operating margin longer-term at NIKE?\n\n---\n\nWell, as you know, our model has said that we believe we can grow our top line at the high single-digit rate, that we will expand our profit margins and over time, we aim to deliver mid-teens EPS growth. So that is our goal. And what that would imply is that we are going to be expanding margins over time. The speed at which that happens is always a function of lots of different variables. We are really excited about the strength of our business at this point, and I think we're delivering some fantastic results, as you can see from what we reported today. We obviously have a macroeconomic environment we're dealing with. So we believe we can expand the profitability of this business over the long haul. How that plays out over given fiscal years and quarters is subject to a lot of different variables.\n\n---\n\nAnd then could you just speak to the composition of the order book in terms of the front end versus back end, and also the breakdown between pricing and unit growth?\n\n---\n\nWell, the front half, back half, it's slightly stronger in the second quarter than in the first quarter on the futures. And that's both a function of a slight acceleration in the back half of the window as well as slightly easier foreign exchange comparisons in the second quarter. So on a reported basis, a little faster in the second half of the window.\n\n---\n\nMatthew, the average selling price is up 5% and average increase in units is 8%. That gets you to the 13% reported -- or 13% currency-neutral futures orders.\n\n---\n\nOn the north, I wanted to ask a couple of questions on North America. First, I was hoping you could give a little bit more detail on your Women's business in North America. Maybe an update on some of the moves you made in distribution. I know you had the Nike Training Club shop-in-shops at Macy's and perhaps at some of your other retail partners. Can you -- and then also some of the stores. Can you just tell us where you are with that and what we should be expecting for the next fiscal year? And maybe any quantify -- any metrics around how well those openings are doing?\n\n---\n\nOkay, I'll maybe just kick it off this way, and maybe I'll just start with the top and just continue to reinforce. What we certainly are seeing in our Women's business is just tremendous growth. And so we saw obviously 20% growth for the year, which brings us to about $6 billion. So one of the reasons we've been able to drive growth is because we're putting the pieces together. This aspect of being able to communicate very well with her, at the same, time making sure that the products that we bring into the market are really, really strong. And so I think I've talked a few times about this aspect of bringing innovation and style together, which is really working for us. And then certainly, as you sort of step down into the distribution, we're certainly working with our partners to continue to rollout shop-in-shops in many of the locations that you mentioned. But NIKE.com, it's certainly been one of the really great hallmarks for us because we've seen our ability to really invite the consumer in through our communications. Importantly, engage her, certainly with the NTC app and the things that we're doing there, and then serve her very specifically online. And that business is growing at a much faster rate, faster than our Men's business online and faster than the total brand online. So we believe that, that really is providing a great window of opportunity for what we think is just going to continue to be great growth there.\n\n---\n\nGreat. Next I wanted to ask was on North American margins were really solid in the quarter even though you were dealing with some inventory backup from the West Coast port congestion. So I was wondering if we should be expecting deteriorating margin performance across the year as you work through some of that inventory and Trevor you sounded pretty optimistic about how healthy the market was, so maybe it will be a non-issue. Just some clarification around that.\n\n---\n\nWell, as I said in the prepared remarks and Trevor said this as well, that we feel very confident that we're going to be working through that inventory in a way that it's brand accretive and is not going to be problematic from a profitability standpoint. Again, I'm not trying to get to any specific prediction of a percentage on one of the geographies. North America has done a phenomenal job over the last few years of building profitability. They have a very well developed network of factory stores. They manage that marketplace very well. So we're confident that we're going to work our way through that inventory in a constructive way.\n\n---\n\nDon, best of luck in your next endeavors.\n\n---\n\nThank you, thank you.\n\n---\n\nTwo questions. Just first on Western Europe, and I guess maybe, Europe overall. How much further do you think the category offense has to go? And I think DTC, I think you guys said it was up 39% in Europe. How much of that is driven by new store openings versus dot-com? Just how are you getting that great growth in Europe?\n\n---\n\nYes, as we -- so as we've talked about before, one of the things that we really felt confident about is that the category offense is really providing us the opportunity to continue to uncover and unlock more growth in the marketplace. And certainly, what we've seen take place is the brand is very, very strong in Western Europe. We're seeing really growth across the different territories. Obviously, we spoke about AGS as well as in the U.K. and Ireland. And our partnerships that we're doing with our wholesale partners, with the JD Sports, Foot Locker and Intersport, are continuing to drive that. Our dot-com business in Western Europe is also growing at an accelerated pace. So what is driving the numbers in the DTC, primarily would be the dot-com growth, that's growing at certainly a faster rate than the overall business. But our ability to drive more conversion in the stores where we currently exist still is taking place. So we've been able to increase the sell-through within our own doors. As we've always talked about, that learning, we then take that to our wholesale partners, that's really helping to drive the overall growth in the marketplace. So we continue to feel very confident about the growth. Again, I won't say that it will go on forever. But certainly, we see a lot of runway for quite some time.\n\n---\n\nI just want to add that the growth and the strength that NIKE in Western Europe is sort of a smaller example of what we often refer to as our complete offense. So we're seeing really strong broad-based growth across the various countries, across Europe, across the categories, across both DTC and wholesale. So it's a very healthy, broad-based, complete offense from a brand strength and a growth standpoint. The brand, by the way, based on recent surveys, seem to be the #1 favorite sports brand in 10 of the key Western European cities. So that's all good news for us.\n\n---\n\nThat sounds great. And just my last question, I guess for Trevor. Trevor, when you think about the success of shoes like the Downshifter and Wind Flow in the mid-tier, how do you think about how successful those shoes can become without cannibalizing some of the higher price point sneaker styles that you guys are already hugely successful in?\n\n---\n\nYes, no, I would say that obviously, Mark always talked about the complete offense and that is really what we're ensuring that we're doing. We're making sure that we look at certainly, our Running business or the opportunities, certainly, from the premium segment, making sure that we're driving that. The important opportunity of what we described as core, which is the mid-tier priced zones. But also our Sportswear business provides another opportunity for us to continue to really come at the market from a holistic perspective. So we believe that there is still more growth in the marketplace and we're able to continue to take share by growing the market altogether. So we feel very confident about that strategy, and we continue to bring innovation amongst all those dimensions.\n\n---\n\nBefore we end the call today, I'd also, on behalf of the finance function, like to thank Don for his leadership over the years and his mentorship to me, personally, and to welcome Andy as the new leader of our function. So thank you, Don. With that, we'll go ahead and end the call. Thank you, all, for joining us, and we'll talk to you in Q1.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Robert Drbul (Analysts)】\nDon, congratulations. Thanks for everything. Best of luck.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Donald Blair (Executives)】\nThanks, Bob.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Drbul (Analysts)】\nI guess the question that I have is on the Running category. I just wondered if we could just have a little bit more of a discussion around -- the core, I think has gotten better, but just an update on the competitive set and sort of how you guys are feeling about that category as we look forward.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Trevor Edwards (Executives)】\nYes, Bob. Actually, I feel really good about the Running category. For the year, the Running category actually grew 9% and what we saw certainly in the fourth quarter, we saw actually strong double-digit growth in most of our geographies from North America to Europe to China. And what we are doing very well is we are connecting very well with runners in the marketplace, so we continue to feel very confident about the business. And at the same time, what we have seen is the strengthening in the core, as we discussed, which is really about the mid-price -- the mid-priced tier zone. And what we've done there is certainly, we've gone in and zoned in, and we've always talk about diving in deeper. That's a great example. We've gone in deeper and focused on that. At the same time, I feel very confident about the innovation that is coming and that has been delivered and continues to be in the pipeline for Running. So overall, I'm very confident about the Running business. There's always room for opportunity and more growth and obviously, for us to continue to excite our consumers. But I certainly feel positive about it.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Parker (Executives)】\nI'm just going to jump in, too. And I want to shout out Nike Running apparel as well, which has had an incredible run this past year, and that momentum continues into fiscal '16. And as I said before, I was sitting through the innovation, category-based innovation meetings recently, and our innovation pipeline for Running leading up to Rio is incredibly strong. So very bullish on that core category for NIKE.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Drbul (Analysts)】\nAnd I guess just -- I guess, could you elaborate a little bit -- my second question would be on the NBA -- the deal that you struck with the NBA? And I was wondering, maybe we could just put Don on the spot, he could give his pick for the #1 spot tonight.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Donald Blair (Executives)】\nIt's not going to be my hometown, Sixers, I don't think.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Parker (Executives)】\nWell, first of all, I'm going to jump in on the NBA. Very, very excited about our partnership with the NBA. As you know, there's great energy in the sport globally. We have very progressive leadership under Adam Silver, really strong leadership there. Adam and his team, the owners have an appetite to really innovate and advance the game, which is perfect for us. We're thrilled to be a part of that. We have 3 incredible brands that can play in this space, of course, Nike, Jordan and Converse. We have on-court brand exposure head-to-toe for the first time, and that's across the NBA, the WNBA, the All-Star Games, the D-League. It's going to be a great opportunity to showcase our leadership in this critical category for us, not just here in the U.S., but globally.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kate McShane (Analysts)】\nMy question, my first question is on gross margins. In fiscal year '16 the guidance that you gave today, can you give us an idea on just overall manufacturing costs and how they're coming into play into cost of goods sold, just given all the initiatives you have with automation and Flyknit and everything else?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Donald Blair (Executives)】\nSure. Well, we are starting to see some benefits out of that program. And as you know, we've been on a long journey of working with our factory partners to improve costs in the factory system and maintain the innovation and the quality of our products. So we've been doing things that are more evolutionary like lean manufacturing and just factory efficiency types of initiatives with them all the way, through breakthrough things like Flyknit. So we've been getting benefits for quite some time. We are starting to see some of the newer technologies coming onstream now. And so that's a part of the equation for FY '16. At this stage, there's lots of other factors. There are some headwinds out there, of course, with labor inflation and FX, but on the flip side, we've done a pretty consistent job of raising average gross selling prices, our DTC business of course, is accretive. So overall, on margin, we're pretty confident we can keep moving margin forward.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kate McShane (Analysts)】\nAnd then my second question is on SG&A. Going again on your guidance, they had mid-single-digit growth for fiscal year '16. I know fiscal year '15 has at least 1 quarter of Olympic spend or more, because we're entering into an Olympic year. So can you help us understand better how we should think about demand creation and corporate overhead and the breakdown of that for fiscal year '16?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Donald Blair (Executives)】\nWell, I don't want to get into too much granularity here because we don't normally provide that level of granularity. And as we've talked about in the last couple of calls, Kate, there's really been an evolution of how we think about consumer engagement. And in today's world, where so much of our marketing is digital, we are investing quite a bit in digital consumer engagement, and a lot of those costs fall into our operating overhead lines. So there's been a little bit of a blurring of the nature of those costs. Obviously, from an accounting standpoint, there's still clarity of it. But from a business standpoint, a lot of the things that we use to drive our business and consumer engagements are actually falling into the operating overhead lines.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Omar Saad (Analysts)】\nI wanted to ask a question about kind of on the topic of the geographic evolution of the supply chain. There's a pretty important vote through the Senate yesterday, and you guys have made some comments publicly maybe about some manufacturing eventually coming back. But how do you think about some of these recent developments, legislative developments and your overall supply chain as you look out in the coming years and the potential to even bring -- to put some production into the U.S. and North America?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Parker (Executives)】\nYes, well, first of all, the passing of the TPA was obviously an important step toward what we hope is the final approval of TPP. And as we've said before, as you know, this will help us to accelerate the work that we're doing with advanced manufacturing, will help us expand our business overall. I think certainly, give us an opportunity to build local manufacturing here in the United States, can put us closer to market, advance some of the innovation, particularly in the area of customization. We are in the middle -- Don has mentioned this briefly, but scaling our advanced manufacturing initiatives, which we've really been working on over the past 3 or 4 years. So you're going to start to see those scale. But the opportunity to get some -- translate some duty relief into investing in our advanced manufacturing supply chain efforts here in the United States is going to be significant. We hope, I mean that's our goal, so that the idea is that, that will accelerate and we'll see some real benefits from that. I think you're going to see the overall supply chain geographically shift a bit here and there, with the advancements of new manufacturing, innovation that is a major priority for NIKE. It will give us the flexibility to create more localized manufacturing over time. And that will put us closer to market, and again, allow us to advance products, particularly in the customization area, and to meet more local demand as well.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Donald Blair (Executives)】\nThe point I would make, too, Omar, is we are really encouraged by the passage of TPA. We still have a little bit of a ways to go from a timing standpoint to see TPP taken up by the Congress. And then of course, once it were implemented, it would take some time for those duty changes to be phased in.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Omar Saad (Analysts)】\nAnd is the right way to think about it, any sort of potential duty savings, kind of being reinvested back into the supply chain or other areas of the business? Or is this -- is it more of a sustainable kind of opportunity on the margin line?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Donald Blair (Executives)】\nI think it's way too early to say on that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Omar Saad (Analysts)】\nDon, congratulations. Best wishes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Donald Blair (Executives)】\nThanks, Omar.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matthew Boss (Analysts)】\nSo just to kind of look ahead and put things together. If top line growth remained at least high single digits, and then you take the combination of Europe and China margin recapture and some increased scale with both e-commerce and Flyknit, is there anything structurally -- I guess my question is there anything structurally preventing a high teens operating margin longer-term at NIKE?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Donald Blair (Executives)】\nWell, as you know, our model has said that we believe we can grow our top line at the high single-digit rate, that we will expand our profit margins and over time, we aim to deliver mid-teens EPS growth. So that is our goal. And what that would imply is that we are going to be expanding margins over time. The speed at which that happens is always a function of lots of different variables. We are really excited about the strength of our business at this point, and I think we're delivering some fantastic results, as you can see from what we reported today. We obviously have a macroeconomic environment we're dealing with. So we believe we can expand the profitability of this business over the long haul. How that plays out over given fiscal years and quarters is subject to a lot of different variables.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matthew Boss (Analysts)】\nAnd then could you just speak to the composition of the order book in terms of the front end versus back end, and also the breakdown between pricing and unit growth?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Donald Blair (Executives)】\nWell, the front half, back half, it's slightly stronger in the second quarter than in the first quarter on the futures. And that's both a function of a slight acceleration in the back half of the window as well as slightly easier foreign exchange comparisons in the second quarter. So on a reported basis, a little faster in the second half of the window.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kelley Hall (Executives)】\nMatthew, the average selling price is up 5% and average increase in units is 8%. That gets you to the 13% reported -- or 13% currency-neutral futures orders.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Lindsay Mann (Analysts)】\nOn the north, I wanted to ask a couple of questions on North America. First, I was hoping you could give a little bit more detail on your Women's business in North America. Maybe an update on some of the moves you made in distribution. I know you had the Nike Training Club shop-in-shops at Macy's and perhaps at some of your other retail partners. Can you -- and then also some of the stores. Can you just tell us where you are with that and what we should be expecting for the next fiscal year? And maybe any quantify -- any metrics around how well those openings are doing?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Trevor Edwards (Executives)】\nOkay, I'll maybe just kick it off this way, and maybe I'll just start with the top and just continue to reinforce. What we certainly are seeing in our Women's business is just tremendous growth. And so we saw obviously 20% growth for the year, which brings us to about $6 billion. So one of the reasons we've been able to drive growth is because we're putting the pieces together. This aspect of being able to communicate very well with her, at the same, time making sure that the products that we bring into the market are really, really strong. And so I think I've talked a few times about this aspect of bringing innovation and style together, which is really working for us. And then certainly, as you sort of step down into the distribution, we're certainly working with our partners to continue to rollout shop-in-shops in many of the locations that you mentioned. But NIKE.com, it's certainly been one of the really great hallmarks for us because we've seen our ability to really invite the consumer in through our communications. Importantly, engage her, certainly with the NTC app and the things that we're doing there, and then serve her very specifically online. And that business is growing at a much faster rate, faster than our Men's business online and faster than the total brand online. So we believe that, that really is providing a great window of opportunity for what we think is just going to continue to be great growth there.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Lindsay Mann (Analysts)】\nGreat. Next I wanted to ask was on North American margins were really solid in the quarter even though you were dealing with some inventory backup from the West Coast port congestion. So I was wondering if we should be expecting deteriorating margin performance across the year as you work through some of that inventory and Trevor you sounded pretty optimistic about how healthy the market was, so maybe it will be a non-issue. Just some clarification around that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Donald Blair (Executives)】\nWell, as I said in the prepared remarks and Trevor said this as well, that we feel very confident that we're going to be working through that inventory in a way that it's brand accretive and is not going to be problematic from a profitability standpoint. Again, I'm not trying to get to any specific prediction of a percentage on one of the geographies. North America has done a phenomenal job over the last few years of building profitability. They have a very well developed network of factory stores. They manage that marketplace very well. So we're confident that we're going to work our way through that inventory in a constructive way.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Ohmes (Analysts)】\nDon, best of luck in your next endeavors.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Donald Blair (Executives)】\nThank you, thank you.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Ohmes (Analysts)】\nTwo questions. Just first on Western Europe, and I guess maybe, Europe overall. How much further do you think the category offense has to go? And I think DTC, I think you guys said it was up 39% in Europe. How much of that is driven by new store openings versus dot-com? Just how are you getting that great growth in Europe?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Trevor Edwards (Executives)】\nYes, as we -- so as we've talked about before, one of the things that we really felt confident about is that the category offense is really providing us the opportunity to continue to uncover and unlock more growth in the marketplace. And certainly, what we've seen take place is the brand is very, very strong in Western Europe. We're seeing really growth across the different territories. Obviously, we spoke about AGS as well as in the U.K. and Ireland. And our partnerships that we're doing with our wholesale partners, with the JD Sports, Foot Locker and Intersport, are continuing to drive that. Our dot-com business in Western Europe is also growing at an accelerated pace. So what is driving the numbers in the DTC, primarily would be the dot-com growth, that's growing at certainly a faster rate than the overall business. But our ability to drive more conversion in the stores where we currently exist still is taking place. So we've been able to increase the sell-through within our own doors. As we've always talked about, that learning, we then take that to our wholesale partners, that's really helping to drive the overall growth in the marketplace. So we continue to feel very confident about the growth. Again, I won't say that it will go on forever. But certainly, we see a lot of runway for quite some time.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Parker (Executives)】\nI just want to add that the growth and the strength that NIKE in Western Europe is sort of a smaller example of what we often refer to as our complete offense. So we're seeing really strong broad-based growth across the various countries, across Europe, across the categories, across both DTC and wholesale. So it's a very healthy, broad-based, complete offense from a brand strength and a growth standpoint. The brand, by the way, based on recent surveys, seem to be the #1 favorite sports brand in 10 of the key Western European cities. So that's all good news for us.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Ohmes (Analysts)】\nThat sounds great. And just my last question, I guess for Trevor. Trevor, when you think about the success of shoes like the Downshifter and Wind Flow in the mid-tier, how do you think about how successful those shoes can become without cannibalizing some of the higher price point sneaker styles that you guys are already hugely successful in?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Trevor Edwards (Executives)】\nYes, no, I would say that obviously, Mark always talked about the complete offense and that is really what we're ensuring that we're doing. We're making sure that we look at certainly, our Running business or the opportunities, certainly, from the premium segment, making sure that we're driving that. The important opportunity of what we described as core, which is the mid-tier priced zones. But also our Sportswear business provides another opportunity for us to continue to really come at the market from a holistic perspective. So we believe that there is still more growth in the marketplace and we're able to continue to take share by growing the market altogether. So we feel very confident about that strategy, and we continue to bring innovation amongst all those dimensions.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kelley Hall (Executives)】\nBefore we end the call today, I'd also, on behalf of the finance function, like to thank Don for his leadership over the years and his mentorship to me, personally, and to welcome Andy as the new leader of our function. So thank you, Don. With that, we'll go ahead and end the call. Thank you, all, for joining us, and we'll talk to you in Q1.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you, Christine, and good morning to everyone. I'm joined this morning by Hugh Grant, our Chairman and CEO; Brett Begemann, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and by Pierre Courduroux, our CFO. Also joining me from the IR team are Tim Boeker, Priyal Patel and Ashley Wissmann. Our third quarter call provides the wrap-up of our 2 most significant quarters and the early views into our outlook for the coming year. Today, we will be sharing a business and strategic overview as well as a summary of our third quarter results and full year outlook. This call is being webcast, and you can access the webcast, supporting slides and the replay at monsanto.com. \r\nWe have provided you today with EPS measures on both a GAAP and ongoing business basis. Where we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, we reconcile to GAAP in the slides and in the press release, both of which are on the website. \r\nThis call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements are based on assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, the company's actual performance and results may vary in a material way from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. A description of the factors that may cause such a variance is included in the safe harbor language in our most recent 10-Q and in today's press release. \r\nFirst and foremost, let me review our third quarter results as shown on Slide 4. Our third quarter ongoing earnings per share is $2.39, well above the range we outlined at our second quarter call, due primarily to the successful completion of the licensing agreement with Scotts Miracle-Gro, reinforcing our confidence for the year. Our free cash flow year-to-date is a use of $789 million as compared to a use of $1.4 billion year-to-date in the prior year, primarily reflecting the absence of The Climate acquisition and the Novozymes transaction in the current fiscal year. With these results and our outlook for the year, we remain at the low end of the guidance ranges, namely $5.75 to $6 of ongoing earnings per share and $2 billion to $2.2 billion of free cash flow, as shown on Slide 5. \r\nWith that brief summary, let me hand it to Hugh to provide the strategic outlook.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Laura, and good morning to everybody on the line. The close of our third quarter is always a pivotal time in our business and never more so than this year. With our proposal to combine with Syngenta, we've put forward a transformational plan to further drive sustainable intensification for growers in the future. Our business and our pipeline are stronger than they've ever been. Our ethos, however, is to continually challenge ourselves to be proactive in our thinking. With our proposal, we're looking beyond the short-term macro challenges to drive the next evolution in agriculture. The challenges facing the world's food supply continue to evolve. The growing population, along with our volatile and changing climate, place ever-increasing burdens on global food production, as shown on Slide 6. \r\nEquipping farmers with the right set of innovations that will help solve tomorrow's food challenges today requires more than a new company; it requires a new vision and a new approach. This is what's at the heart of this new company proposal, as shown on Slide 7. Combining the strengths of Monsanto and Syngenta would accelerate the development of new innovations, increase our scale and reach and provide a broader spectrum of products for growers around the world. And it would use data science to offer a more insightful, precise approach to agriculture. \r\nSyngenta's announcement yesterday, albeit a one-sided communication, is promising in that it does reinforce the validity of our integrated solutions theory. But in our opinion, it overstates the risks to execute the proposal. And without Monsanto as a partner, it lacks our leading seed footprint, digital ag platform and track record for innovation and execution. A Monsanto-Syngenta combination represents the optimal solution to unlock this value. We believe we're simply the best positioned to drive the opportunity with a current proposal that offers a significant premium: more than 30% over the 3-year average price, a 43% premium versus their unaffected stock price and a 45% premium over the 12-month weighted average stock price. And importantly, it provides an ongoing growth opportunity for the combined shareowners. I would encourage -- I would continue then to encourage the shareowners to appeal to their board to simply engage in constructive discussions with us regarding our very attractive proposal, one that we believe has the best interest of our customers, our respective shareowners and society in mind. \r\nSo let's take a closer look at the core tenets of our strategic rationale that support this assertion, as shown on Slide 8. As always, it begins with innovation by using the R&D capabilities of Monsanto and Syngenta in the fields of breeding, biotechnology, crop protection, biologicals and data science that will allow us to put new solutions in the hands of farmers. Secondly, a stronger global presence with more integrated solutions unlocks scale and reach that isn't possible today: more acres, more farms, more crops and more geographies. The new company would bring a new set of options to farmers in certain regions of the world who, due to limitations in their access to technology, are not currently able to maximize production. Today, our foundation and our core crops reaches 400 million of the world's 3.5 billion acres of arable land. To fully address the demand for food production, we need to deliver technology and insights to every acre and every farmer, from large-scale operations in the Americas to smallholder farmers in Africa. All farmers deserve the choices and the opportunities to be successful. This combination would expand our ability to deliver innovation across more of those acres, including the highly relevant cereal crops which make up the majority of the global caloric intake. Third, this would give us an even more precise approach to every acre, creating immediate and long-term revenue growth opportunities through a diverse range of optimized, integrated solutions. \r\nNear term, by combining Syngenta's leading crop-protection portfolio with Monsanto's leading seed footprint, we would have the unique ability to provide leading, science-based recommendations of integrated seed, trait and crop-protection solutions. This integrated approach is no longer a theory, but the reality that we see today with the success of our Roundup Ready PLUS and our Acceleron seed-care programs. This combination would also allow us to more fully participate in the value-creation from our crop protection solution recommendations. A prime example of that is our announcement today to begin our preliminary investment in dicamba production at our Luling, Louisiana location. Pending final approvals, we're considering a potential investment of more than $1 billion over the course of 3 to 5 years to support this 200 million-acre opportunity. \r\nLonger term and unique to Monsanto, we will be able to unlock a new data-driven approach to provide farmers even more valuable, real-time insights about their crops with our Climate platform. The information would provide actionable crop protection recommendations to farmers to maximize productivity while ensuring inputs are applied in a precise manner to meet society's broad goal to preserve and protect our environment. And this is ultimately what makes this proposal unique. Many in the industry have theorized on integrated strategies, but we believe we're best positioned with our strong seed footprint and our leading digital ag platform. This, bottom line, delivers new opportunities and much-needed yield for growers around the world. \r\nFourth, it provides synergies that create value for shareowners. We believe the proposed combination would deliver substantial cost synergies and revenue growth opportunities that create value for shareowners of both companies. This includes an attractive return on invested capital and a responsible capital structure, taking into account cash proceeds from the planned divestitures. These core tenets are not new to us. Our track record and our commitment to innovation, paired with our execution and our financial discipline, positions us well to lead the next evolution in agriculture. The many milestones we've reached this year, as Brett and Pierre will highlight, offer the continued proof points and give us confidence to reconfirm our full year guidance. \r\nLooking to the longer term, as shown on Slide 9. Optimized spending and the milestones that we delivered this year reinforce our confidence in our 5-year plan to more than double our fiscal year 2014 ongoing earnings per share by 2019. While we believe the combination with Syngenta is optimal to serve our customers for the long term and would drive even greater growth in long-term earnings per share, our current portfolio and our pipeline leads the industry and provides multiple levers to drive our long-term growth projections. We're committed to using the full range of variables in this plan, adapting the path to our long-term target as conditions shift. \r\nWhile the pursuit of this next evolution in agriculture creates new opportunities to meet the long-term demands of sustainable food production, importantly, we're not allowing it to distract us from managing the business at hand. So where are we today? We've made a highly compelling proposal to Syngenta at CHF 449 per share, one that provides a 43% or a CHF 12 billion premium to their shareowners, along with a potential for significant upside from the benefit of the growth prospects of the combined entity, as the 2 companies together are more valuable than the 2 alone. Furthermore, we've provided significant regulatory certainty by agreeing to divest all of Syngenta's seeds and traits businesses, along with competing chemistry products. We've underscored our confidence in obtaining regulatory approvals by offering a substantial $2 billion reverse breakup fee if we're unable to obtain such approvals. The interest in the sale of the seed assets has been extraordinary, giving us confidence that we can divest of the businesses at an attractive price. \r\nI'm personally encouraged by the reactions I've heard to our proposal from our respective shareowners, customers and other stakeholders. It's disappointing that Syngenta hasn't engaged in substantive discussions about the many benefits of the combination, including those for farmers around the world. We remain committed to unlocking this opportunity and will continue to pursue a constructive conversation, but the window for seizing this opportunity is measured in months, not years. This vision is simply too important to delay executing, to make it a reality for growers and owners alike. \r\nSo with that, I'll hand over to Brett to provide the operational business update. Brett?\n\n---\n\nThanks, Hugh, and good morning to everyone on the line. There's no doubt it's been a tough year with the macro pressures facing global agriculture, namely a retreat in corn acres, currency and pressured commodity prices. That said, I've not seen our relationships with our farmer customers, our portfolio, our position in the market or our pipeline stronger than I see them right now. I feel really good about our position, and that's a real testament to the strength of our core business. You need to look no further than this year and our third quarter performance to see the strength and the benefits of the global portfolio we cultivated. A real highlight this quarter stems from a core element of our strategy, our broad licensing approach. In the second quarter, we highlighted that there were licensing opportunities that could come as soon as this year, and in our third quarter, we announced an agreement with Scotts Miracle-Gro, unlocking additional value in the Roundup lawn and garden brand. As we look across our pipeline of new products as well as our existing portfolio and brand franchises, we expect to continue to attract additional licensing opportunities. \r\nIn corn, on Slide 10, we continue to see demand for the newer hybrids and technologies enabling positive germplasm mix lift and footprint expansion. The portfolio mix curve is intact and demonstrates that even in this environment, growers are demanding the newest hybrids. Exclusive of currency headwinds, we continue to expect to deliver positive germplasm mix lift for the full year. And we continue to see footprint expansion as we remain on track to hold or grow our branded share in every major market in the face of declining corn acres, which we still estimate to be down 11 million to 12 million acres over the past 2 years. \r\nWith the line of sight from our third quarter, where we've seen a good uptick in the U.S. in-season ordering, we now believe corn acres will be in the range of 88 million to 89 million acres. We're also seeing the shift in the Channel brand we were expecting, as the growth in that business is now largely reflected in our third quarter results. Against that, we now expect a softer start in Latin America due to industry expectations that acres will be lower in the coming season, and also of slightly lower acres in other x U.S. regions such as Europe.  As I look at this 2015 season, the germplasm price mix lift and footprint expansion we're tracking towards in a time of compressed margins for growers reflects the continued demand for high-performing seed technologies based on strong product performance and customer relationships, reinforcing our confidence in the long-term outlook for this business. \r\nIn soybeans, the early milestones in the Decade of the Bean translate to margins, with our soybean platform set to deliver over $0.5 billion in gross profit growth since the end of the fiscal year 2013. This growth highlights the significance of the runway of opportunity in this platform. Intacta, the single largest incremental driver of our soybean growth on Slide 11, is delivering. We've reached a record 15 million acres across South America this year, and with production and operational plans in place for fiscal year '16, we expect to penetrate an estimated 30 million acres with greater than 150 varieties in Brazil alone, a meaningful tipping point in the 100 million-acre opportunity for Intacta. \r\nIn addition to rolling out production plans, we continue to make meaningful progress with the establishment of the POD system in Northern Argentina. Approximately 70% of growers elected to pay upfront, and we've now seen the majority of the grain-handling partners operationalize the system, collecting royalties for those who opt to pay at harvest. In the U.S., it's too soon to call exactly where acres will shake out, but with the additional clarity we have from the spring planting progress, we expect U.S. soybean acres closer to 85 million versus earlier estimates of 87 million acres. And the combination of shipments and our order book continues to indicate our share is growing, with farmers continuing to choose Roundup Ready 2 Yield as the product of choice across our branded and licensed footprint. \r\nOur Roundup Ready Xtend crop system, as shown on Slide 12, comes on the heels of Intacta. We continue to make progress on pre-commercial activities in the U.S., setting up what we expect to be a record soybean launch, targeting more than 3 million acres in 2016, pending necessary regulatory approvals. To that point, this quarter, we reached an important milestone with the receipt of the EU import approval for Roundup Ready Xtend soybeans, and we've submitted all the required data to the China Ministry of Agriculture and await their approval. Farmers are in the need of this technology, and we're looking forward to being able to deliver this to the market in 2016, setting up the next wave of growth in our soybean business. \r\nWe can see the demand for this next-generation weed control technology in cotton this year on Slide 13. Despite the pullback in cotton acres this year, our limited introduction of Bollgard II XtendFlex is sold out, with the technology exceeding our initial target, reaching more than 750,000 acres, as growers limited returns to ensure they could access these new varieties on as many acres as possible. We expect these new best-in-class varieties to drive back-to-back share growth in the Deltapine brand in the U.S. as we remain on track for Deltapine to become the #1 brand share position. \r\nWe're also seeing better-than-expected progress in the rollout of our Climate Pro offering this season. At the beginning of the year, we laid out 3 key priorities for the platform, and we see significant progress against those, shown on Slide 14, as well as continued evolution of the platform in this emerging technology space to set up the focus on an integrated platform. First, we committed to stepping up our investment, and we've expanded our organization to enhance our offerings and expertise. We've closed on our 640 Labs acquisition in December, and our organization is already incorporating their capabilities. Second, we targeted to increase our active enrollment in the Climate platform. To date, we've enrolled more than 75 million acres on the Climate platform, which is roughly 45% of the total planted corn and soybean acres in the U.S. And with the current usage trends from those who use the platform weekly, we are tracking nicely towards our active-use target of 45 million acres. And finally, I'm most excited about the runway to our premium offerings. With a significant step-up in orders this past month, our premium services now exceeds 5 million acres. That's 2.5x our initial target. While not financially material in this early stage of adoption, it is clear proof that farmers value improved insights to allow them to reduce known variability and improve overall productivity. Overall, this performance increases our confidence that Climate will serve as the integrator in our vision of fully integrated solutions. \r\nI'm also pleased to highlight that our BioAg Alliance with Novozymes is off to a great start. Since the close of the deal in February of 2014, our partnership is stronger than ever. Integration of the existing business is occurring smoothly, and joint product and R&D teams are established and running well. In fact, roughly 2,000 microbial strains, which is an increase of 4x the prior season's quantity, have been sourced from our joint discovery efforts, fermented by Novozymes, encoded on corn and soybean seeds by Monsanto. These have now been planted across more than 50 sites in the U.S. In addition, our teams are running microbial field tests in over 20 countries in North and South America, Europe and Asia in our effort to discover new transformational microbial solutions for farmers. \r\nIn Ag Productivity, our third quarter was a significant one, not only because of the Scotts agreement but also because we're seeing the volume shift to our branded business we expected as we provide customers with more of our branded products for their critical over-the-top applications. This puts us on track for a significant step-up in the portion of our business that's sold as a branded volume this year. Against that, we're seeing some incremental softening in price at the retail level. So consistent with our strategy, we continue to adjust our pricing to maintain a premium over the generics within our targeted ranges. Further, across the industry in the U.S., with the early and quick planting window in some regions, coupled with the extended periods of rain in other areas, we've seen some decline in volumes for Q3. As of today, growers patiently wait to make the critical over-the-top sprays in the fourth quarter. \r\nAs I step back and look at this year, it's evident that the power of a balanced portfolio, coupled with differentiated brands and technologies, drives growth. This is allowing us to better withstand a challenging ag backdrop and backs our confidence in our growth longer term. We fully expect the macro environment to recover and are well positioned to participate when it does. That said, as we develop our operational plans for next year, we are taking a clear-eyed view, and we expect that many of these headwinds will continue into fiscal year 2016. As we proactively plan for the success of our long-term growth vision in light of these trends, we plan to continue to optimize our operating cost structure. As we target the next level of savings, we plan to optimize processes, streamline administrative cost and use automation and data science to optimize the way we do work in the lab and in the field, in products we deliver and in ways we deliver the experience. This is about using technology and smarter processes to maintain our operational effectiveness while continuing to invest for the long-term success of our new growth platforms. \r\nI'd like to close my operational update with our announcement to begin our preliminary investment in a dicamba manufacturing facility. We are setting the stage for the industry's next leading integrated solution in weed control, shown on Slide 15. The Roundup Ready Xtend crop system has a practical fit on more than 200 million acres when looking across soybeans and cotton in the Americas, and has the potential to be even bigger if ultimately expanded to include corn. Today's dicamba production capacity covers less than 20% of the expected opportunity. Bottom line, with today's announcement, we're taking the initial step to ensure that growers have access to all elements of the Roundup Ready Xtend crop system. \r\nOver the next decade, as the technology penetrates more of the 200 million-plus-acre opportunity, this holds the potential to further diversify our Ag Productivity segment and provide a source of growth longer term. This is a prime example of the integrated solutions we've been sharing in our vision for a new combined ag company and demonstrates how we can more fully participate in the value we create and deliver an expected attractive return on capital with the proposed investment. \r\nIn summary, our business accomplishments this year in a more challenging ag environment are remarkable. They highlight the strength of a strong portfolio and the importance of disciplined business plans. Importantly, as I look at this year, we've delivered on many key milestones that we expect to propel our growth longer term. These milestones, along with licensing opportunities, disciplined spend and a solid capital allocation strategy, backs our confidence in our ability to deliver on our long-term target to more than double our 2014 ongoing earnings per share by 2019. As Hugh indicated, the pursuit of this next evolution in agriculture is of utmost importance to us to meet the long-term demands of sustainable food production. And I look forward to engaging in constructive discussions with Syngenta to begin that journey, fully recognizing that the strong, healthy base business we have in Monsanto today is vital to the success of the new company. \r\nWith that, I will pass it to Pierre for the financial update. Pierre?\n\n---\n\nThanks, Brett, and good morning to everyone. With the close of our third quarter, we have essentially met our full year earnings-per-share guidance for the fiscal year, with the delivery of $5.75 of ongoing earnings per share on a year-to-date basis. This was accomplished through a combination of leading innovation, a balanced portfolio and financial discipline in terms of how we manage our spend, in how we capture the value from our portfolio and in how we advance our capital structure. \r\nSo let's look at the highlights. In soybeans, we see continued strong performance of our Roundup Ready 2 Yield in the U.S., topping off the tremendous growth from Intacta in the first half of the year. Year-to-date, we delivered more than $200 million of gross profit growth in global soybeans and improved our gross profit margins by a full point. In our global corn business, germplasm mix lift remained positive when excluding the effects of currency. And our year-to-date gross profit margins were essentially flat at 53% versus the prior year, with a 5-point improvement in the third quarter. Our margins benefited from the change in our business model in the U.S. Channel brand and from global germplasm mix lift, which now offset the decline in trade pricing in Brazil and the increases in corn COGS, primarily in Brazil and Europe. On an absolute basis, the total corn gross profit declined by about $300 million, as the benefit from germplasm price mix lift and the growth in our global branded and licensed share was more than offset by the decrease in global acres, weaker foreign currencies and increased cost of goods. \r\nIn cotton, while the absolute gross profit is down, primarily from the decline in acres in the U.S. and Australia, gross profit margins improved by a full point, driven by the adoption of new higher-value cotton varieties in the U.S. and increases in our licensed business in India. With the onetime benefit of $274 million related to the sale of an intellectual property perpetual license to Scotts and an increase in the branded mix of glyphosate-based herbicides, our year-to-date Ag Productivity gross profit shows an increase of about 2%. However, the decline in generic glyphosate pricing has continued, and we also saw some delays in glyphosate volumes in Q3. \r\nFurther, our teams have remained extremely disciplined on the spend front through effective management of variable spend and open positions. Year-to-date, our total operating expense were flat with the prior year, effectively absorbing more than $100 million of inflationary increases and our ramping spend on our new Climate and biological platforms. This discipline has allowed us to lift our year-to-date EBIT margin by nearly 1 point. \r\nFinally, we successfully completed our $6 billion accelerated share buyback program this quarter, and our share count now stands at 469 million shares outstanding, a reduction of more than 55 million shares since we initiated our new capital allocation strategy just a year ago. \r\nWith this strong year-to-date performance and the line of sight we have on our fourth quarter, we reconfirm our full year guidance for ongoing earnings per share at the low end of our original range of $5.75 to $6, as shown on Slide 16. Practically, this means that our fourth quarter is now expected to be close to breakeven, as the benefits from licensing transaction we had expected in Q4 in Seeds and Genomics came to fruition instead in Q3 in Ag Productivity with the signing of this agreement with Scotts. The amount of this benefit exceeded our placeholder estimate of about $100 million into the fourth quarter, and the increase is helping offset some additional market softness in corn, Roundup and soybeans for the full year. At this juncture, we do not expect any additional material licensing agreements before the end of the fiscal year. \r\nLooking at our full year guidance, we now anticipate that our gross profit for Seeds and Genomics will be essentially flat year-over-year but with roughly 0.5 point in gross profit margin improvement. The evolution since our Q2 call is twofold. First, our global corn gross profit is now expected to be down more than $200 million for the full year, as we are not expecting Latin America to have as strong a start as originally anticipated and because planted acres across Europe ended lower than we had expected while their COGS increased. Second, our global soybean business gross profit, while still expected to grow by more than $200 million for the full year, is down slightly from prior estimates, as it now appears that U.S. acres will be modestly lower than expected. For Ag Productivity, we now expect the gross profit to be down only slightly for the full year, reflecting the benefit of the Scotts transaction as an offset to the anticipated 15% to 17% decline in gross profit related to the softening of generic glyphosate pricing and currency headwinds this fiscal year. From a spend perspective, we still expect our total operating expenses, inclusive of the new platform investment, to be down in the range of 3% to 5%, likely closer to the higher end of the range. We continue to manage variable and discretionary spend very closely, which is typically higher in our fourth quarter, with currency and lower incentive also driving lower expenses. Operating expense is expected to be a little less than half of the prior year amount, and our net financing expense in Q4 is expected to increase over the Q3 run rate with our typical incremental customer financing programs. Finally, the tax rate for the full year continues to migrate lower, and we now expect it to be in the range of 27% to 28%, more in line with our third quarter effective tax rate. \r\nFrom a free cash perspective, we continue to track to the lower end of our original guidance of $2 billion to $2.2 billion, as shown on Slide 17. Our net income and working capital use remain consistent with our prior guidance, and we have begun the execution of our plans to proactively manage our corn inventory for next year through the planning of a smaller-scale production plan this spring. This plan reduces long-term inventory risk and is an effective management of our cash, but depending on the ultimate yield, it may translate into a 1- to 2-point margin penalty in corn next year due to lower cost -- fixed cost absorption. \r\nWhile planning for the next steps in building our Xtend platform with the potential meaningful capital investments at our Luling plant for the production of dicamba, we remain very diligent in the management of our investing cash flows. We expect the investment to exceed $1 billion over 3 to 5 years, with the preliminary investment beginning now. With our excellent conversion of earnings into cash, we continue to target a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.5 as a standalone company. However, as of now, we have put our share repurchase program on hold as we continue to pursue our Syngenta proposal. The successful combination with Syngenta at our proposed price and consideration mix would translate into a higher leverage ratio for the near term. But to be clear, a solid investment-grade credit rating and continued access to the commercial paper market going forward is an important consideration for us. We expect substantial cash proceeds from the proposed divestitures, and before finalizing the permanent financing of any potential Syngenta transaction, we intend to consult with a rating agency. \r\nLooking beyond the current year, as Brett mentioned, we are in the process of assembling our operation plan for fiscal year '16. And barring a significant shift in the U.S. growing season or the general macroeconomic environment, we are planning for the continuation of several headwinds from this year. As we build a plan, we will prudently consider currency, commodity prices, corn COGS and generic glyphosate prices. This, of course, is expected to be balanced against key growth drivers, including the annual corn germplasm refresh, Intacta expansion, Xtend launches, continued licensing opportunities and expected share growth in our seeds footprint globally. Finally, the plans we are developing also consider the opportunity to potentially reduce and optimize our operating expenses in the range of $300 million to $500 million over the course of the next 2 fiscal years. We are building in options in these plans to allow us to adjust the level of savings with improved clarity on the potential cost synergies from the proposed combination with Syngenta. The associated cost to implement these plans, timing of approvals and execution will ultimately be contingent upon the outcome of our proposal to Syngenta. In the coming months and as we get better clarity on the evolution of these macro factors and the critical Northern Hemisphere growing season, we will provide more specifics on the outlook for fiscal year '16. Our 5-year plan is a natural extension of the coming year's operational plan, and we remain confident in our commitment to more than double our 2014 ongoing EPS by 2019, as shown on Slide 18. \r\nOur foundation and opportunity for gross profit growth remain strong, and the continuation of financial discipline, both in terms of estimated cost savings and capital structure, backs our confidence in the long-term outlook. Continued share repurchases, accretive acquisitions and capital investments all have the potential to contribute to this commitment, in addition to the power of innovation, the increasingly balanced portfolio and the financial discipline that have led us to our success to date. The delivery of key business milestones, coupled with our financial discipline, fuels our long-term growth and provides the springboard for the vision Hugh outlined. \r\nOur proposal to combine with Syngenta to create a new, even more innovative solution-oriented global ag company represents the forward thinking that has become our hallmark and looks beyond the near-term industry challenges to see the opportunity, an opportunity we believe we are the best positioned to convert into value for our shareowners, our customers and broader society. \r\nThanks, and I'll turn the time back over to Laura for the Q&A.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Pierre. With that, we'd like to open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Christine, I think we're ready for questions from the line.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Laura Meyer (Executives)】\nThank you, Christine, and good morning to everyone. I'm joined this morning by Hugh Grant, our Chairman and CEO; Brett Begemann, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and by Pierre Courduroux, our CFO. Also joining me from the IR team are Tim Boeker, Priyal Patel and Ashley Wissmann. Our third quarter call provides the wrap-up of our 2 most significant quarters and the early views into our outlook for the coming year. Today, we will be sharing a business and strategic overview as well as a summary of our third quarter results and full year outlook. This call is being webcast, and you can access the webcast, supporting slides and the replay at monsanto.com. \r\nWe have provided you today with EPS measures on both a GAAP and ongoing business basis. Where we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, we reconcile to GAAP in the slides and in the press release, both of which are on the website. \r\nThis call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements are based on assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, the company's actual performance and results may vary in a material way from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. A description of the factors that may cause such a variance is included in the safe harbor language in our most recent 10-Q and in today's press release. \r\nFirst and foremost, let me review our third quarter results as shown on Slide 4. Our third quarter ongoing earnings per share is $2.39, well above the range we outlined at our second quarter call, due primarily to the successful completion of the licensing agreement with Scotts Miracle-Gro, reinforcing our confidence for the year. Our free cash flow year-to-date is a use of $789 million as compared to a use of $1.4 billion year-to-date in the prior year, primarily reflecting the absence of The Climate acquisition and the Novozymes transaction in the current fiscal year. With these results and our outlook for the year, we remain at the low end of the guidance ranges, namely $5.75 to $6 of ongoing earnings per share and $2 billion to $2.2 billion of free cash flow, as shown on Slide 5. \r\nWith that brief summary, let me hand it to Hugh to provide the strategic outlook.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Hugh Grant (Executives)】\nThank you, Laura, and good morning to everybody on the line. The close of our third quarter is always a pivotal time in our business and never more so than this year. With our proposal to combine with Syngenta, we've put forward a transformational plan to further drive sustainable intensification for growers in the future. Our business and our pipeline are stronger than they've ever been. Our ethos, however, is to continually challenge ourselves to be proactive in our thinking. With our proposal, we're looking beyond the short-term macro challenges to drive the next evolution in agriculture. The challenges facing the world's food supply continue to evolve. The growing population, along with our volatile and changing climate, place ever-increasing burdens on global food production, as shown on Slide 6. \r\nEquipping farmers with the right set of innovations that will help solve tomorrow's food challenges today requires more than a new company; it requires a new vision and a new approach. This is what's at the heart of this new company proposal, as shown on Slide 7. Combining the strengths of Monsanto and Syngenta would accelerate the development of new innovations, increase our scale and reach and provide a broader spectrum of products for growers around the world. And it would use data science to offer a more insightful, precise approach to agriculture. \r\nSyngenta's announcement yesterday, albeit a one-sided communication, is promising in that it does reinforce the validity of our integrated solutions theory. But in our opinion, it overstates the risks to execute the proposal. And without Monsanto as a partner, it lacks our leading seed footprint, digital ag platform and track record for innovation and execution. A Monsanto-Syngenta combination represents the optimal solution to unlock this value. We believe we're simply the best positioned to drive the opportunity with a current proposal that offers a significant premium: more than 30% over the 3-year average price, a 43% premium versus their unaffected stock price and a 45% premium over the 12-month weighted average stock price. And importantly, it provides an ongoing growth opportunity for the combined shareowners. I would encourage -- I would continue then to encourage the shareowners to appeal to their board to simply engage in constructive discussions with us regarding our very attractive proposal, one that we believe has the best interest of our customers, our respective shareowners and society in mind. \r\nSo let's take a closer look at the core tenets of our strategic rationale that support this assertion, as shown on Slide 8. As always, it begins with innovation by using the R&D capabilities of Monsanto and Syngenta in the fields of breeding, biotechnology, crop protection, biologicals and data science that will allow us to put new solutions in the hands of farmers. Secondly, a stronger global presence with more integrated solutions unlocks scale and reach that isn't possible today: more acres, more farms, more crops and more geographies. The new company would bring a new set of options to farmers in certain regions of the world who, due to limitations in their access to technology, are not currently able to maximize production. Today, our foundation and our core crops reaches 400 million of the world's 3.5 billion acres of arable land. To fully address the demand for food production, we need to deliver technology and insights to every acre and every farmer, from large-scale operations in the Americas to smallholder farmers in Africa. All farmers deserve the choices and the opportunities to be successful. This combination would expand our ability to deliver innovation across more of those acres, including the highly relevant cereal crops which make up the majority of the global caloric intake. Third, this would give us an even more precise approach to every acre, creating immediate and long-term revenue growth opportunities through a diverse range of optimized, integrated solutions. \r\nNear term, by combining Syngenta's leading crop-protection portfolio with Monsanto's leading seed footprint, we would have the unique ability to provide leading, science-based recommendations of integrated seed, trait and crop-protection solutions. This integrated approach is no longer a theory, but the reality that we see today with the success of our Roundup Ready PLUS and our Acceleron seed-care programs. This combination would also allow us to more fully participate in the value-creation from our crop protection solution recommendations. A prime example of that is our announcement today to begin our preliminary investment in dicamba production at our Luling, Louisiana location. Pending final approvals, we're considering a potential investment of more than $1 billion over the course of 3 to 5 years to support this 200 million-acre opportunity. \r\nLonger term and unique to Monsanto, we will be able to unlock a new data-driven approach to provide farmers even more valuable, real-time insights about their crops with our Climate platform. The information would provide actionable crop protection recommendations to farmers to maximize productivity while ensuring inputs are applied in a precise manner to meet society's broad goal to preserve and protect our environment. And this is ultimately what makes this proposal unique. Many in the industry have theorized on integrated strategies, but we believe we're best positioned with our strong seed footprint and our leading digital ag platform. This, bottom line, delivers new opportunities and much-needed yield for growers around the world. \r\nFourth, it provides synergies that create value for shareowners. We believe the proposed combination would deliver substantial cost synergies and revenue growth opportunities that create value for shareowners of both companies. This includes an attractive return on invested capital and a responsible capital structure, taking into account cash proceeds from the planned divestitures. These core tenets are not new to us. Our track record and our commitment to innovation, paired with our execution and our financial discipline, positions us well to lead the next evolution in agriculture. The many milestones we've reached this year, as Brett and Pierre will highlight, offer the continued proof points and give us confidence to reconfirm our full year guidance. \r\nLooking to the longer term, as shown on Slide 9. Optimized spending and the milestones that we delivered this year reinforce our confidence in our 5-year plan to more than double our fiscal year 2014 ongoing earnings per share by 2019. While we believe the combination with Syngenta is optimal to serve our customers for the long term and would drive even greater growth in long-term earnings per share, our current portfolio and our pipeline leads the industry and provides multiple levers to drive our long-term growth projections. We're committed to using the full range of variables in this plan, adapting the path to our long-term target as conditions shift. \r\nWhile the pursuit of this next evolution in agriculture creates new opportunities to meet the long-term demands of sustainable food production, importantly, we're not allowing it to distract us from managing the business at hand. So where are we today? We've made a highly compelling proposal to Syngenta at CHF 449 per share, one that provides a 43% or a CHF 12 billion premium to their shareowners, along with a potential for significant upside from the benefit of the growth prospects of the combined entity, as the 2 companies together are more valuable than the 2 alone. Furthermore, we've provided significant regulatory certainty by agreeing to divest all of Syngenta's seeds and traits businesses, along with competing chemistry products. We've underscored our confidence in obtaining regulatory approvals by offering a substantial $2 billion reverse breakup fee if we're unable to obtain such approvals. The interest in the sale of the seed assets has been extraordinary, giving us confidence that we can divest of the businesses at an attractive price. \r\nI'm personally encouraged by the reactions I've heard to our proposal from our respective shareowners, customers and other stakeholders. It's disappointing that Syngenta hasn't engaged in substantive discussions about the many benefits of the combination, including those for farmers around the world. We remain committed to unlocking this opportunity and will continue to pursue a constructive conversation, but the window for seizing this opportunity is measured in months, not years. This vision is simply too important to delay executing, to make it a reality for growers and owners alike. \r\nSo with that, I'll hand over to Brett to provide the operational business update. Brett?\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Brett Begemann (Executives)】\nThanks, Hugh, and good morning to everyone on the line. There's no doubt it's been a tough year with the macro pressures facing global agriculture, namely a retreat in corn acres, currency and pressured commodity prices. That said, I've not seen our relationships with our farmer customers, our portfolio, our position in the market or our pipeline stronger than I see them right now. I feel really good about our position, and that's a real testament to the strength of our core business. You need to look no further than this year and our third quarter performance to see the strength and the benefits of the global portfolio we cultivated. A real highlight this quarter stems from a core element of our strategy, our broad licensing approach. In the second quarter, we highlighted that there were licensing opportunities that could come as soon as this year, and in our third quarter, we announced an agreement with Scotts Miracle-Gro, unlocking additional value in the Roundup lawn and garden brand. As we look across our pipeline of new products as well as our existing portfolio and brand franchises, we expect to continue to attract additional licensing opportunities. \r\nIn corn, on Slide 10, we continue to see demand for the newer hybrids and technologies enabling positive germplasm mix lift and footprint expansion. The portfolio mix curve is intact and demonstrates that even in this environment, growers are demanding the newest hybrids. Exclusive of currency headwinds, we continue to expect to deliver positive germplasm mix lift for the full year. And we continue to see footprint expansion as we remain on track to hold or grow our branded share in every major market in the face of declining corn acres, which we still estimate to be down 11 million to 12 million acres over the past 2 years. \r\nWith the line of sight from our third quarter, where we've seen a good uptick in the U.S. in-season ordering, we now believe corn acres will be in the range of 88 million to 89 million acres. We're also seeing the shift in the Channel brand we were expecting, as the growth in that business is now largely reflected in our third quarter results. Against that, we now expect a softer start in Latin America due to industry expectations that acres will be lower in the coming season, and also of slightly lower acres in other x U.S. regions such as Europe.  As I look at this 2015 season, the germplasm price mix lift and footprint expansion we're tracking towards in a time of compressed margins for growers reflects the continued demand for high-performing seed technologies based on strong product performance and customer relationships, reinforcing our confidence in the long-term outlook for this business. \r\nIn soybeans, the early milestones in the Decade of the Bean translate to margins, with our soybean platform set to deliver over $0.5 billion in gross profit growth since the end of the fiscal year 2013. This growth highlights the significance of the runway of opportunity in this platform. Intacta, the single largest incremental driver of our soybean growth on Slide 11, is delivering. We've reached a record 15 million acres across South America this year, and with production and operational plans in place for fiscal year '16, we expect to penetrate an estimated 30 million acres with greater than 150 varieties in Brazil alone, a meaningful tipping point in the 100 million-acre opportunity for Intacta. \r\nIn addition to rolling out production plans, we continue to make meaningful progress with the establishment of the POD system in Northern Argentina. Approximately 70% of growers elected to pay upfront, and we've now seen the majority of the grain-handling partners operationalize the system, collecting royalties for those who opt to pay at harvest. In the U.S., it's too soon to call exactly where acres will shake out, but with the additional clarity we have from the spring planting progress, we expect U.S. soybean acres closer to 85 million versus earlier estimates of 87 million acres. And the combination of shipments and our order book continues to indicate our share is growing, with farmers continuing to choose Roundup Ready 2 Yield as the product of choice across our branded and licensed footprint. \r\nOur Roundup Ready Xtend crop system, as shown on Slide 12, comes on the heels of Intacta. We continue to make progress on pre-commercial activities in the U.S., setting up what we expect to be a record soybean launch, targeting more than 3 million acres in 2016, pending necessary regulatory approvals. To that point, this quarter, we reached an important milestone with the receipt of the EU import approval for Roundup Ready Xtend soybeans, and we've submitted all the required data to the China Ministry of Agriculture and await their approval. Farmers are in the need of this technology, and we're looking forward to being able to deliver this to the market in 2016, setting up the next wave of growth in our soybean business. \r\nWe can see the demand for this next-generation weed control technology in cotton this year on Slide 13. Despite the pullback in cotton acres this year, our limited introduction of Bollgard II XtendFlex is sold out, with the technology exceeding our initial target, reaching more than 750,000 acres, as growers limited returns to ensure they could access these new varieties on as many acres as possible. We expect these new best-in-class varieties to drive back-to-back share growth in the Deltapine brand in the U.S. as we remain on track for Deltapine to become the #1 brand share position. \r\nWe're also seeing better-than-expected progress in the rollout of our Climate Pro offering this season. At the beginning of the year, we laid out 3 key priorities for the platform, and we see significant progress against those, shown on Slide 14, as well as continued evolution of the platform in this emerging technology space to set up the focus on an integrated platform. First, we committed to stepping up our investment, and we've expanded our organization to enhance our offerings and expertise. We've closed on our 640 Labs acquisition in December, and our organization is already incorporating their capabilities. Second, we targeted to increase our active enrollment in the Climate platform. To date, we've enrolled more than 75 million acres on the Climate platform, which is roughly 45% of the total planted corn and soybean acres in the U.S. And with the current usage trends from those who use the platform weekly, we are tracking nicely towards our active-use target of 45 million acres. And finally, I'm most excited about the runway to our premium offerings. With a significant step-up in orders this past month, our premium services now exceeds 5 million acres. That's 2.5x our initial target. While not financially material in this early stage of adoption, it is clear proof that farmers value improved insights to allow them to reduce known variability and improve overall productivity. Overall, this performance increases our confidence that Climate will serve as the integrator in our vision of fully integrated solutions. \r\nI'm also pleased to highlight that our BioAg Alliance with Novozymes is off to a great start. Since the close of the deal in February of 2014, our partnership is stronger than ever. Integration of the existing business is occurring smoothly, and joint product and R&D teams are established and running well. In fact, roughly 2,000 microbial strains, which is an increase of 4x the prior season's quantity, have been sourced from our joint discovery efforts, fermented by Novozymes, encoded on corn and soybean seeds by Monsanto. These have now been planted across more than 50 sites in the U.S. In addition, our teams are running microbial field tests in over 20 countries in North and South America, Europe and Asia in our effort to discover new transformational microbial solutions for farmers. \r\nIn Ag Productivity, our third quarter was a significant one, not only because of the Scotts agreement but also because we're seeing the volume shift to our branded business we expected as we provide customers with more of our branded products for their critical over-the-top applications. This puts us on track for a significant step-up in the portion of our business that's sold as a branded volume this year. Against that, we're seeing some incremental softening in price at the retail level. So consistent with our strategy, we continue to adjust our pricing to maintain a premium over the generics within our targeted ranges. Further, across the industry in the U.S., with the early and quick planting window in some regions, coupled with the extended periods of rain in other areas, we've seen some decline in volumes for Q3. As of today, growers patiently wait to make the critical over-the-top sprays in the fourth quarter. \r\nAs I step back and look at this year, it's evident that the power of a balanced portfolio, coupled with differentiated brands and technologies, drives growth. This is allowing us to better withstand a challenging ag backdrop and backs our confidence in our growth longer term. We fully expect the macro environment to recover and are well positioned to participate when it does. That said, as we develop our operational plans for next year, we are taking a clear-eyed view, and we expect that many of these headwinds will continue into fiscal year 2016. As we proactively plan for the success of our long-term growth vision in light of these trends, we plan to continue to optimize our operating cost structure. As we target the next level of savings, we plan to optimize processes, streamline administrative cost and use automation and data science to optimize the way we do work in the lab and in the field, in products we deliver and in ways we deliver the experience. This is about using technology and smarter processes to maintain our operational effectiveness while continuing to invest for the long-term success of our new growth platforms. \r\nI'd like to close my operational update with our announcement to begin our preliminary investment in a dicamba manufacturing facility. We are setting the stage for the industry's next leading integrated solution in weed control, shown on Slide 15. The Roundup Ready Xtend crop system has a practical fit on more than 200 million acres when looking across soybeans and cotton in the Americas, and has the potential to be even bigger if ultimately expanded to include corn. Today's dicamba production capacity covers less than 20% of the expected opportunity. Bottom line, with today's announcement, we're taking the initial step to ensure that growers have access to all elements of the Roundup Ready Xtend crop system. \r\nOver the next decade, as the technology penetrates more of the 200 million-plus-acre opportunity, this holds the potential to further diversify our Ag Productivity segment and provide a source of growth longer term. This is a prime example of the integrated solutions we've been sharing in our vision for a new combined ag company and demonstrates how we can more fully participate in the value we create and deliver an expected attractive return on capital with the proposed investment. \r\nIn summary, our business accomplishments this year in a more challenging ag environment are remarkable. They highlight the strength of a strong portfolio and the importance of disciplined business plans. Importantly, as I look at this year, we've delivered on many key milestones that we expect to propel our growth longer term. These milestones, along with licensing opportunities, disciplined spend and a solid capital allocation strategy, backs our confidence in our ability to deliver on our long-term target to more than double our 2014 ongoing earnings per share by 2019. As Hugh indicated, the pursuit of this next evolution in agriculture is of utmost importance to us to meet the long-term demands of sustainable food production. And I look forward to engaging in constructive discussions with Syngenta to begin that journey, fully recognizing that the strong, healthy base business we have in Monsanto today is vital to the success of the new company. \r\nWith that, I will pass it to Pierre for the financial update. Pierre?\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Pierre Courduroux (Executives)】\nThanks, Brett, and good morning to everyone. With the close of our third quarter, we have essentially met our full year earnings-per-share guidance for the fiscal year, with the delivery of $5.75 of ongoing earnings per share on a year-to-date basis. This was accomplished through a combination of leading innovation, a balanced portfolio and financial discipline in terms of how we manage our spend, in how we capture the value from our portfolio and in how we advance our capital structure. \r\nSo let's look at the highlights. In soybeans, we see continued strong performance of our Roundup Ready 2 Yield in the U.S., topping off the tremendous growth from Intacta in the first half of the year. Year-to-date, we delivered more than $200 million of gross profit growth in global soybeans and improved our gross profit margins by a full point. In our global corn business, germplasm mix lift remained positive when excluding the effects of currency. And our year-to-date gross profit margins were essentially flat at 53% versus the prior year, with a 5-point improvement in the third quarter. Our margins benefited from the change in our business model in the U.S. Channel brand and from global germplasm mix lift, which now offset the decline in trade pricing in Brazil and the increases in corn COGS, primarily in Brazil and Europe. On an absolute basis, the total corn gross profit declined by about $300 million, as the benefit from germplasm price mix lift and the growth in our global branded and licensed share was more than offset by the decrease in global acres, weaker foreign currencies and increased cost of goods. \r\nIn cotton, while the absolute gross profit is down, primarily from the decline in acres in the U.S. and Australia, gross profit margins improved by a full point, driven by the adoption of new higher-value cotton varieties in the U.S. and increases in our licensed business in India. With the onetime benefit of $274 million related to the sale of an intellectual property perpetual license to Scotts and an increase in the branded mix of glyphosate-based herbicides, our year-to-date Ag Productivity gross profit shows an increase of about 2%. However, the decline in generic glyphosate pricing has continued, and we also saw some delays in glyphosate volumes in Q3. \r\nFurther, our teams have remained extremely disciplined on the spend front through effective management of variable spend and open positions. Year-to-date, our total operating expense were flat with the prior year, effectively absorbing more than $100 million of inflationary increases and our ramping spend on our new Climate and biological platforms. This discipline has allowed us to lift our year-to-date EBIT margin by nearly 1 point. \r\nFinally, we successfully completed our $6 billion accelerated share buyback program this quarter, and our share count now stands at 469 million shares outstanding, a reduction of more than 55 million shares since we initiated our new capital allocation strategy just a year ago. \r\nWith this strong year-to-date performance and the line of sight we have on our fourth quarter, we reconfirm our full year guidance for ongoing earnings per share at the low end of our original range of $5.75 to $6, as shown on Slide 16. Practically, this means that our fourth quarter is now expected to be close to breakeven, as the benefits from licensing transaction we had expected in Q4 in Seeds and Genomics came to fruition instead in Q3 in Ag Productivity with the signing of this agreement with Scotts. The amount of this benefit exceeded our placeholder estimate of about $100 million into the fourth quarter, and the increase is helping offset some additional market softness in corn, Roundup and soybeans for the full year. At this juncture, we do not expect any additional material licensing agreements before the end of the fiscal year. \r\nLooking at our full year guidance, we now anticipate that our gross profit for Seeds and Genomics will be essentially flat year-over-year but with roughly 0.5 point in gross profit margin improvement. The evolution since our Q2 call is twofold. First, our global corn gross profit is now expected to be down more than $200 million for the full year, as we are not expecting Latin America to have as strong a start as originally anticipated and because planted acres across Europe ended lower than we had expected while their COGS increased. Second, our global soybean business gross profit, while still expected to grow by more than $200 million for the full year, is down slightly from prior estimates, as it now appears that U.S. acres will be modestly lower than expected. For Ag Productivity, we now expect the gross profit to be down only slightly for the full year, reflecting the benefit of the Scotts transaction as an offset to the anticipated 15% to 17% decline in gross profit related to the softening of generic glyphosate pricing and currency headwinds this fiscal year. From a spend perspective, we still expect our total operating expenses, inclusive of the new platform investment, to be down in the range of 3% to 5%, likely closer to the higher end of the range. We continue to manage variable and discretionary spend very closely, which is typically higher in our fourth quarter, with currency and lower incentive also driving lower expenses. Operating expense is expected to be a little less than half of the prior year amount, and our net financing expense in Q4 is expected to increase over the Q3 run rate with our typical incremental customer financing programs. Finally, the tax rate for the full year continues to migrate lower, and we now expect it to be in the range of 27% to 28%, more in line with our third quarter effective tax rate. \r\nFrom a free cash perspective, we continue to track to the lower end of our original guidance of $2 billion to $2.2 billion, as shown on Slide 17. Our net income and working capital use remain consistent with our prior guidance, and we have begun the execution of our plans to proactively manage our corn inventory for next year through the planning of a smaller-scale production plan this spring. This plan reduces long-term inventory risk and is an effective management of our cash, but depending on the ultimate yield, it may translate into a 1- to 2-point margin penalty in corn next year due to lower cost -- fixed cost absorption. \r\nWhile planning for the next steps in building our Xtend platform with the potential meaningful capital investments at our Luling plant for the production of dicamba, we remain very diligent in the management of our investing cash flows. We expect the investment to exceed $1 billion over 3 to 5 years, with the preliminary investment beginning now. With our excellent conversion of earnings into cash, we continue to target a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.5 as a standalone company. However, as of now, we have put our share repurchase program on hold as we continue to pursue our Syngenta proposal. The successful combination with Syngenta at our proposed price and consideration mix would translate into a higher leverage ratio for the near term. But to be clear, a solid investment-grade credit rating and continued access to the commercial paper market going forward is an important consideration for us. We expect substantial cash proceeds from the proposed divestitures, and before finalizing the permanent financing of any potential Syngenta transaction, we intend to consult with a rating agency. \r\nLooking beyond the current year, as Brett mentioned, we are in the process of assembling our operation plan for fiscal year '16. And barring a significant shift in the U.S. growing season or the general macroeconomic environment, we are planning for the continuation of several headwinds from this year. As we build a plan, we will prudently consider currency, commodity prices, corn COGS and generic glyphosate prices. This, of course, is expected to be balanced against key growth drivers, including the annual corn germplasm refresh, Intacta expansion, Xtend launches, continued licensing opportunities and expected share growth in our seeds footprint globally. Finally, the plans we are developing also consider the opportunity to potentially reduce and optimize our operating expenses in the range of $300 million to $500 million over the course of the next 2 fiscal years. We are building in options in these plans to allow us to adjust the level of savings with improved clarity on the potential cost synergies from the proposed combination with Syngenta. The associated cost to implement these plans, timing of approvals and execution will ultimately be contingent upon the outcome of our proposal to Syngenta. In the coming months and as we get better clarity on the evolution of these macro factors and the critical Northern Hemisphere growing season, we will provide more specifics on the outlook for fiscal year '16. Our 5-year plan is a natural extension of the coming year's operational plan, and we remain confident in our commitment to more than double our 2014 ongoing EPS by 2019, as shown on Slide 18. \r\nOur foundation and opportunity for gross profit growth remain strong, and the continuation of financial discipline, both in terms of estimated cost savings and capital structure, backs our confidence in the long-term outlook. Continued share repurchases, accretive acquisitions and capital investments all have the potential to contribute to this commitment, in addition to the power of innovation, the increasingly balanced portfolio and the financial discipline that have led us to our success to date. The delivery of key business milestones, coupled with our financial discipline, fuels our long-term growth and provides the springboard for the vision Hugh outlined. \r\nOur proposal to combine with Syngenta to create a new, even more innovative solution-oriented global ag company represents the forward thinking that has become our hallmark and looks beyond the near-term industry challenges to see the opportunity, an opportunity we believe we are the best positioned to convert into value for our shareowners, our customers and broader society. \r\nThanks, and I'll turn the time back over to Laura for the Q&A.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Laura Meyer (Executives)】\nThanks, Pierre. With that, we'd like to open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Christine, I think we're ready for questions from the line.",
      "transcript_text3": "Hugh, a question on your dicamba investment. It's a pretty sizable investment. You talked about getting a reasonable return on investment. Is that return on investment based on just the chemistry itself? Or is that considering the roughly $6 fee you're going to get on Xtend? So just wondering how big an opportunity dicamba as a chemistry can be for you going forward.\n\n---\n\nYes, thanks for the question, Don. I think it's going to be substantial. We said $200 million plus. I wish we had it today. There's tremendous demand out there. As we run the math on this, we look at both. We look at the opportunity -- the return based on the plan alone and then also the platform opportunity when you enable 200 million-plus acres. But Pierre, maybe a few more quick words?\n\n---\n\nYes. And in both cases and exactly as Hugh mentioned, we've been looking at the picture from both perspectives, so as a standalone chemical and as a system. And in both cases, we're delivering IRRs in the double digit, so feeling pretty good. And obviously, including the value of the traits, it's way higher. So we feel good about the potential return from that project.\n\n---\n\nHugh, I think you made a comment that the window of opportunity for a Syngenta deal will be measured in months, not years. Obviously, Syngenta has shown a reluctance to engage to date. If you're unable to consummate a deal in coming months, can you speak to your capital allocation thoughts in the wake of that scenario? In other words, would you resume repurchases? Or might there be other partners of interest in crop protection? And also, have you considered a partnership in -- or with a crop-protection producer as a means to an end of achieving your integrated solution vision on digital ag?\n\n---\n\nKevin, thanks for the question. So call me traditional, but I always think that business gets done when people meet, when they sit down across the table and try and work out a solution. And we've been singularly unsuccessful in getting Syngenta to sit down and talk. We've seen the videos where they talk to themselves, but I'd love to be able to engage in a conversation. The months versus years, I've talked about this being a long game. We have a tremendous response from the Syngenta shareowners and from combined shareowners between Monsanto and Syngenta. But I think the opportunity is significant. And if unsuccessful, this isn't something we're going to turn into an epic struggle. We will look -- we're committed to bringing chemistry up onto those platforms, and we would look at other opportunities. Having said that -- either through partnerships or otherwise. Having said that, I get the feeling that we haven't really -- we haven't been running the first lap in this Syngenta discussion yet. But as I said in my prepared comments, there's mounting frustration on both sides of the Atlantic and puzzlement why they won't sit down. Your second question on capital allocation, we would, and Pierre alluded to this, we would revert back to our commitments in our original plan, but we're keeping our powder dry at the moment until we endeavor to conclude these conversations.\n\n---\n\nI was hoping you could discuss the source of the incremental $300 million to $500 million in cost cuts that you're targeting. And the follow-up question is if the environment for growers or FX does improve, do you see a scenario where you would potentially pull back on some of those cost-reduction targets?\n\n---\n\nYes, I'll maybe ask Brett -- thanks for your questions. Maybe I'll ask Brett to say a word on this. Our organization this year has delivered in a tough environment with some significant cost controls. I hope, to your point, that the environment improves, but as we look at '16, our anticipation of '16, in many ways, looks similar to '15. So the prudent thing to do is plan accordingly and anticipate that we will be taking more disciplined actions. But Brett, maybe a word on the sources of those opportunities?\n\n---\n\nYes. So as Hugh mentioned, the discipline that we demonstrated in '15 has been a contributor to our results in '15. And with '16 looking tough, we're planning the same way. And the areas that I mentioned that we're looking at are process optimization, administrative cost. And I think you can bucket this together also, say, in leveraging data science as we learn more about it to drive productivity of our operations in the labs and in the fields and in the marketplace. And those process improvements and optimization all help us reduce cost and basically make us more efficient at delivering products and services to our customers. And that's where we'll be focused.\n\n---\n\nThe Scotts Miracle-Gro transaction seemed like a onetime benefit, so why are you including that in your ongoing EPS guidance? And then secondly, Pierre, last quarter, you explained that the fourth quarter EPS would be 15% to 20% of second half earnings, and now fourth quarter is expected to be breakeven. So what changed in the last 3 months?\n\n---\n\nSo P.J., and this is actually -- I mean, both questions are related, and it's really looking into -- what we said at the end of the second quarter was we are contemplating a number of licensing opportunities, I mean, in both Seeds and Genomics and Ag Productivity, actually. And what we've seen is that the first one to materialize actually quicker than what we anticipated was the Scotts transaction, and that's really part of our business model. We've always been, I mean, really pursuing those opportunities, and we do believe there are further opportunities down the road that we're going to be chasing. So based on where we are today and as I mentioned during the prepared remarks, we don't see any of those opportunities translating into the fourth quarter. However, as I said, we still see potential for some of those, I mean, happening in '16 and maybe beyond that. So this is the licensing part of the question. Regarding -- and obviously, this has an impact on the quarter-to-quarter because you see a benefit in Q3, and as we mentioned, we had a placeholder of more than $100 million in Q4 that now disappears. And we said as well that, I mean, the market condition and especially the beginning of the season in South America, I mean, what we hear from Argentina right now is that acres are going to be down. So we want to be realistic about how we think about the fourth quarter, and this is really how we came to this revised guidance.\n\n---\n\nWas there a revenue benefit to Ag Productivity from the Scotts deal? And if there was, how much was it? And secondly, if you spend $1 billion to extend dicamba capacity, how many gallons do you get for $1 billion?\n\n---\n\nSo I'll take the first part of the question regarding the Scotts transaction. So there was definitely a benefit in terms of the revenue in Ag Productivity, and this is very close, actually, to the $274 million we quoted in terms of gross profit. I don't have the exact number, but these are fairly close to each other.\n\n---\n\nAnd then, Jeff, the same question on dicamba. So we said it would be a 3- to 5-year investment stream. So the front end of this will be the thin end as we do engineering and early spec-ing. The market -- so 20%, Brett? 30%?\n\n---\n\nYes, it'll be in that range, and part of this is the investment in the basic infrastructure to prepare for the development so that you could add additional capacity for far less cost after the initial installation's put in place. You could add another train.\n\n---\n\nBut somewhere in the 20% to 30% range would be -- of future market demand because the market today is quite small. But in classic Monsanto fashion, we'll be creating that market and then supplying it. But that would be a rough guideline.\n\n---\n\nHugh, on corn gross profit, given the pressure on gross margins next year from lower acres or production, can you still -- is it possible to grow corn gross profit next year, given the pressure on margins?\n\n---\n\nYes, I mean, we are -- and Pierre mentioned this in terms of production. We've seen acres skinnying down in Latin America, so the early read there is acres are going to be crimped. We're anticipating -- you look at the challenges this year in corn, so we are anticipating that next year will be a tighter market, and we're more blessed within this that we've got a balanced portfolio. So what we're losing in corn, we're seeing a really nice uptick in beans. But Brett, maybe a little bit on how you see margin and the growth opportunities next year.\n\n---\n\nI think the really good news on this in corn is, as I mentioned, our portfolio is as strong as it's ever been. We continue to see farmers migrating to our best hybrids, in other words, our newest hybrids, which gives us the opportunity to continue to get portfolio mix lift from our germplasm. And we believe that that's going to continue. We will continue to face the headwinds of acres. And when we face the headwinds of acres and the softness that Pierre mentioned in South America, that translates into an impact in COGS because it lowers our production and the absorption of our fixed cost. So we feel really good about our position going into '16, albeit it's going to be a challenging market, not unlike what '15 was. And that's going to have an impact on margins, and we'll be a lot more clear on that as we start to finalize projections for '16.\n\n---\n\nRegarding your Channel brand and Seedsman growth initiatives, can you update us on the potential margin improvement here and the best way to think about this geographically, i.e. are there any U.S. regional limitations? And also, is the portfolio refresh here done at the same rate as DEKALB?\n\n---\n\nSo nice -- so Chris, we've, from an operational point of view, seen some really good improvements in the Channel piece. I'm not sure. I think service to growers and operational, we're better. I don't know if that converts yet into a margin uptick. Brett?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think the primary focus with the change that we made in Channel was changing the relationship and experience with the customer to provide better service and real-time management of inventories in season, and that's gone really well. We feel good about how we made that transition. It really wasn't intended to be a significant margin improvement. There could be a little bit as we continue to improve our overall service there. To your other part of your question, do we refresh the Channel brand like we do DEKALB, each of those decisions are made independently. But yes, we do refresh the Channel brand, and we do bring new products into that portfolio every year, just like we do in DEKALB. And those metrics would be very similar between those 2 brands.\n\n---\n\nAnd again, talking about how you're giving it months to try to have a Syngenta deal done, what has to happen? Or is it a possibility that you could look at an unsolicited offer that you would take directly to Syngenta shareholders? How long would you have to wait to have that happen? And what would have to happen for that to be a suitable outcome?\n\n---\n\nI think there's miles in the journey before we get to that. I think the first step on this -- and I'm very encouraged by the early progress, but the first step on this is direct engagement with their shareowners and explaining, as I've done this morning, the vision that we see for this. There's been a lot of talk around these integrated solutions. There's not been much success historically. And I think the more we talk about the difference between talking and doing, the more interest there is in the vision and the strategy. So I think for us, the near term is the continued outreach to their shareowners and the continued outreach to Syngenta to encourage them to sit down and do this face to face rather than through YouTube and leaked documents. So I'm hoping that we get to a point where we're actually sitting and talking. Your path is always a potential, but my preference would be a friendly deal with the 2 chairmen of these 2 companies.\n\n---\n\nWhen you talk about additional upfront licensing fees potentially in '16, is this more Xtend dicamba-related? Or are there other opportunities on Roundup equal to the size of the Scotts deal you just did?\n\n---\n\nYes. John, thanks for the question. I mean, we've been doing this for years. We talked very early on about architecture and always expanding our licensing opportunity. The one that's front and center, and it's in field trials this year, that I would -- and Pierre kind of alluded to this in his comments, is Corn Rootworm III. So it's next-generation corn rootworm control. We have it in collaborator trials. They'll be doing root digs in the next few weeks, when we can get out of the rain and see ground drying out. So that's one that I'd probably put front and foremost.\n\n---\n\nOn the dicamba investment, I'm curious in the interim, before your own facility starts, how you would source that, given, I think, you're going to use a new formulation to reduce the volatilization. And will it be a branded product and managed in the same manner that you manage Roundup?\n\n---\n\nYes. The short answer would be yes. But Brett, maybe just a little bit of flavor around it. We've done a lot work in formulations. We're encouraged there, and also third-party supplies and collaborators.\n\n---\n\nYes. So the way we're looking at this, Bob, is we're -- if you think about this in stages, getting the products into the marketplace, and there's enough dicamba out there that already supplies about 20% of the market and then -- and we are sourcing some of that. You may recall some months ago, we made the announcement of an investment at our Muscatine facility in a formulation plant, where, yes, we are making our own branded product that we're going to sell in the marketplace. And it is an advanced formulation that brings benefit to the farmers. So we'll do that from sourced material in the near term, and we'll continue to do that until we build our own capacity and bring that online. But it'll -- along the way, we'll continue to use some of those sources that are out there that already have dicamba. So it'll be a combination of all of those.\n\n---\n\nI might have missed this because I had to hop off for a second, but did you talk at all about any progress update on getting the Chinese approval for Xtend?\n\n---\n\nWe did not. We see nice progress in Europe and China. As is traditionally the case, China will be the last piece of this process to come through, but no new news. But we -- I mean, our experience has been China is usually the last piece of this, but China has generally been predictable, and they need beans, so we feel pretty optimistic. But no news, Vincent.\n\n---\n\nIs there a go or no-go date by which you need approval in order to be confident for next year?\n\n---\n\nI wouldn't necessarily think of it as go or no-go date. We're producing seed this year with the anticipation that we will be in the market in 2016, so that -- I guess I would call that already a go. As we get closer to 2016 with the anticipated approval out of China, we'll make those decisions on how we manage that next year. But that will be decisions that will be made in conjunction with our grower customers and the rest of the industry sitting down, working together on this and decide what we do. But at this point, our focus is totally on the China approval. We provided them all the information necessary to make a decision, so we'll stay focused on driving that decision so that we don't have to address the other side of it.\n\n---\n\nSo a couple of quarters back, I asked you about your confidence broadly in getting paid in Argentina. And since then, most of the news flow is the same as always, just chaotic and negative. And you mentioned the POD and that 70% of farmers are paying upfront. My question is, do you think we're headed towards a model where we pay upfront across Brazil and Argentina? And are you thinking any differently about the saved seed issue in soy in Argentina, given what the government's been saying?\n\n---\n\nMark, thanks for the questions. So I think your summary on the news flow looks the same as always, it's chaotic. I think it's just -- it's life in Argentina. When you go down there and you talk to growers, there's tremendous enthusiasm and a pent-up demand for these technologies and the other ones that are coming down the pike. So you have to kind of climb above the noise and look at the macro environment. And I think the evidence -- and your point is exactly right. The evidence is we're seeing growers morph more and more towards buying new bags, but the backstop of POD continues to be important. I mean, Brett, you've been looking at this the last few weeks.\n\n---\n\nYes, I think I would just remind you to think about the early months and years when we put the system in place in Brazil. It was pretty noisy there, too. And I think we're hearing a lot of the same thing out of Argentina. But there's, as Hugh mentioned, tremendous interest in the product. And what we've seen in Brazil -- and I'm not suggesting it'll be an exact carbon copy in Argentina, but I think it'll be the right flavor. As POD got in place, farmers became more comfortable buying new seed every year because they see the value. They see the value in high-quality planting seed and when they're getting better yields and they're buying better seed, they put better seed treatments on, et cetera, et cetera. So I think we'll see the same thing over time in Argentina. The POD system is clearly an important backstop, though, that makes sure we have that in place. And it'll be noisy, but we're still confident it'll move in the right direction.\n\n---\n\nJust talking about Climate Pro since we didn't really talk about that at all or Climate Corp. I'm just wondering, the step-up in orders you saw the past month, what was leading that for the Climate Pro users? Is that around more favorable pricing? And then on top of that, as you look at how that product offering ramps, how do you see kind of that scale up and ramping current [ph] and the pricing coming back?\n\n---\n\nSo I'll ask Brett to give you a little bit of granular detail. Let me just start by saying we're delighted with the progress. It isn't financially material yet, but it does prove out the system. And the link to my earlier comments on Syngenta, what we're seeing this year with some of the nitrogen -- and it's still early. But what we're seeing this year with some of the Nitrogen Advisor work, I think, bridges beautifully into bringing chemistry up onto that acre. So what we do in nitrogen, there's the opportunity of doing in the future with chemistry and giving the farmer much better advice on when and how he applies chemistry. But still early days, Brett, but some great numbers on the board.\n\n---\n\nYes, we're really excited about it. If you look at the early days of the Climate Pro, which were the paid acres this year, I'd say it was driven by the nitrogen model, which gave farmers lots of insights, particularly in some areas this year that were kind of difficult with the early planting season and lots of rain, et cetera, in some areas. So that played very well. And then the shift which was just as exciting is how much interest there was in the Field Health Advisor this year, which was the other big app that we had available on that paid system this year. And that one really gets at what Hugh was describing as thinking about field, health in the field, helping farmers make the decisions in raising the crop through the rest of the year. It's really impressive to see the interest from farmers. It confirms, again, that farmers understand intuitively they have this variability in the field, and they believe that it can be addressed, and they're willing to work with us to figure out how to do that. So it's an exciting start with that platform.\n\n---\n\nThis is actually Rory Blake in for Frank Mitsch. I just had a couple of quick ones. On the dicamba side, I thought that we were still waiting for regulatory approval on the in-crop use. Is there any update there? And then also, just changing gears a little on the crop -- on The Climate Corporation side, obviously, a nice number on the free offering, a nice number on the premium offering. How should we think about the adoption rate? And is there any change in how we're thinking about pricing for it?\n\n---\n\nI'm sorry, on the second piece, adoption rate on what, sorry?\n\n---\n\nThe adoption rate on the Pro side and also the pricing of it.\n\n---\n\nOh, okay.\n\n---\n\nI think there's 2 pieces in there. On the dicamba side, I believe you're referring to the chemistry over-the-top label, and that is work in process, and we're optimistic on that one. We put cotton in the marketplace this year. And because we had 3 herbicide tolerances there where the farmer could use 2 of them this year, and that's what we used to kind of set the tone on pricing, but we feel really good with our U.S. approach on the over-the-top for dicamba. The other piece on Climate Pro, there's 2 things, and I think it's -- I'm still in the camp that says the most important thing is to develop the robust platform for data sciences for farmers. And it's less about how much profitability we can get in the early years and how much pricing there is in the early years. It's about getting farmers established on a platform that helps them improve the decision-making both before planting, at planting and throughout raising the crop. And that's going to continue to be our focus. Obviously, farmers are demonstrating they see value in it, and they are paying for those services this year. And we'll continue to look at the value that we bring and price into that. But the primary focus in the next couple of years will be continuing to expand that platform.\n\n---\n\nI think that platform play, data becomes the glue that holds the chemistry, the seed and the biotech together. And we are uniquely positioned, and that reminds me so much of the early days of skepticism in biotech and then skepticism in linking biotech and breeding and even the skepticism when we change platforms with 2s and with SmartStax. So we're going to have to demonstrate that. And I would expect that in demonstrating that we can bring these technologies together, we get the opportunity one more time to license that to the rest of the chemical industry.\n\n---\n\nI was just wondering if you could just give us a little more color on some of the restructuring in terms of some of the buckets that you anticipate things coming from. And specifically, are you planning to cut R&D as well? Or is it more OpEx spending?\n\n---\n\nIt's more -- it's much more focused -- and Brett mentioned -- went through some of this earlier, but it's much more on driving efficiency and the use of new technologies. And in R&D this year, we quietly retooled the big piece around breeding. And we think that our breeding programs will be faster, will yield more and cost less. So we actually use that as a surrogate as we look at other opportunities across the company. But it's the application of data science in a number of fields that we think we can streamline and get better and faster.\n\n---\n\nSo thanks, thank you very much, and thanks. We've stayed a little bit long today, so thanks for your patience and your support. I guess in summary, I'd say our business and our pipeline are stronger than they've ever been, and yet -- and this is classic Monsanto -- we continue to challenge ourselves to advance new solutions and provide even more robust tools for farmers around the globe regardless of their size. So with the proposal that I started talking about today, our proposal of combining with Syngenta, we are looking beyond the short-term macro challenges that face agriculture to, once again, drive the next evolution. Many in the industry have theorized. There's been a lot of talk about integrated strategies. But I think, as I said earlier, there's a difference between talking and doing. And we believe we're best positioned with our strong seed footprint and our leading digital ag platform to make this a reality, providing us with an opportunity to be an even stronger partner to growers. So we simply have the proven track record that demands consideration to be the partner of choice in leading this evolution. We appreciate the continued support of the respective owners in driving that dialogue and driving that engagement. So I want to conclude by thanking you for joining us on the call today. Thanks very much.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Donald Carson (Analysts)】\nHugh, a question on your dicamba investment. It's a pretty sizable investment. You talked about getting a reasonable return on investment. Is that return on investment based on just the chemistry itself? Or is that considering the roughly $6 fee you're going to get on Xtend? So just wondering how big an opportunity dicamba as a chemistry can be for you going forward.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hugh Grant (Executives)】\nYes, thanks for the question, Don. I think it's going to be substantial. We said $200 million plus. I wish we had it today. There's tremendous demand out there. As we run the math on this, we look at both. We look at the opportunity -- the return based on the plan alone and then also the platform opportunity when you enable 200 million-plus acres. But Pierre, maybe a few more quick words?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pierre Courduroux (Executives)】\nYes. And in both cases and exactly as Hugh mentioned, we've been looking at the picture from both perspectives, so as a standalone chemical and as a system. And in both cases, we're delivering IRRs in the double digit, so feeling pretty good. And obviously, including the value of the traits, it's way higher. So we feel good about the potential return from that project.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kevin McCarthy (Analysts)】\nHugh, I think you made a comment that the window of opportunity for a Syngenta deal will be measured in months, not years. Obviously, Syngenta has shown a reluctance to engage to date. If you're unable to consummate a deal in coming months, can you speak to your capital allocation thoughts in the wake of that scenario? In other words, would you resume repurchases? Or might there be other partners of interest in crop protection? And also, have you considered a partnership in -- or with a crop-protection producer as a means to an end of achieving your integrated solution vision on digital ag?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hugh Grant (Executives)】\nKevin, thanks for the question. So call me traditional, but I always think that business gets done when people meet, when they sit down across the table and try and work out a solution. And we've been singularly unsuccessful in getting Syngenta to sit down and talk. We've seen the videos where they talk to themselves, but I'd love to be able to engage in a conversation. The months versus years, I've talked about this being a long game. We have a tremendous response from the Syngenta shareowners and from combined shareowners between Monsanto and Syngenta. But I think the opportunity is significant. And if unsuccessful, this isn't something we're going to turn into an epic struggle. We will look -- we're committed to bringing chemistry up onto those platforms, and we would look at other opportunities. Having said that -- either through partnerships or otherwise. Having said that, I get the feeling that we haven't really -- we haven't been running the first lap in this Syngenta discussion yet. But as I said in my prepared comments, there's mounting frustration on both sides of the Atlantic and puzzlement why they won't sit down. Your second question on capital allocation, we would, and Pierre alluded to this, we would revert back to our commitments in our original plan, but we're keeping our powder dry at the moment until we endeavor to conclude these conversations.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sandy Klugman (Analysts)】\nI was hoping you could discuss the source of the incremental $300 million to $500 million in cost cuts that you're targeting. And the follow-up question is if the environment for growers or FX does improve, do you see a scenario where you would potentially pull back on some of those cost-reduction targets?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hugh Grant (Executives)】\nYes, I'll maybe ask Brett -- thanks for your questions. Maybe I'll ask Brett to say a word on this. Our organization this year has delivered in a tough environment with some significant cost controls. I hope, to your point, that the environment improves, but as we look at '16, our anticipation of '16, in many ways, looks similar to '15. So the prudent thing to do is plan accordingly and anticipate that we will be taking more disciplined actions. But Brett, maybe a word on the sources of those opportunities?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Brett Begemann (Executives)】\nYes. So as Hugh mentioned, the discipline that we demonstrated in '15 has been a contributor to our results in '15. And with '16 looking tough, we're planning the same way. And the areas that I mentioned that we're looking at are process optimization, administrative cost. And I think you can bucket this together also, say, in leveraging data science as we learn more about it to drive productivity of our operations in the labs and in the fields and in the marketplace. And those process improvements and optimization all help us reduce cost and basically make us more efficient at delivering products and services to our customers. And that's where we'll be focused.\n\n---\n\n【質問: P.J. Juvekar (Analysts)】\nThe Scotts Miracle-Gro transaction seemed like a onetime benefit, so why are you including that in your ongoing EPS guidance? And then secondly, Pierre, last quarter, you explained that the fourth quarter EPS would be 15% to 20% of second half earnings, and now fourth quarter is expected to be breakeven. So what changed in the last 3 months?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pierre Courduroux (Executives)】\nSo P.J., and this is actually -- I mean, both questions are related, and it's really looking into -- what we said at the end of the second quarter was we are contemplating a number of licensing opportunities, I mean, in both Seeds and Genomics and Ag Productivity, actually. And what we've seen is that the first one to materialize actually quicker than what we anticipated was the Scotts transaction, and that's really part of our business model. We've always been, I mean, really pursuing those opportunities, and we do believe there are further opportunities down the road that we're going to be chasing. So based on where we are today and as I mentioned during the prepared remarks, we don't see any of those opportunities translating into the fourth quarter. However, as I said, we still see potential for some of those, I mean, happening in '16 and maybe beyond that. So this is the licensing part of the question. Regarding -- and obviously, this has an impact on the quarter-to-quarter because you see a benefit in Q3, and as we mentioned, we had a placeholder of more than $100 million in Q4 that now disappears. And we said as well that, I mean, the market condition and especially the beginning of the season in South America, I mean, what we hear from Argentina right now is that acres are going to be down. So we want to be realistic about how we think about the fourth quarter, and this is really how we came to this revised guidance.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jeffrey Zekauskas (Analysts)】\nWas there a revenue benefit to Ag Productivity from the Scotts deal? And if there was, how much was it? And secondly, if you spend $1 billion to extend dicamba capacity, how many gallons do you get for $1 billion?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pierre Courduroux (Executives)】\nSo I'll take the first part of the question regarding the Scotts transaction. So there was definitely a benefit in terms of the revenue in Ag Productivity, and this is very close, actually, to the $274 million we quoted in terms of gross profit. I don't have the exact number, but these are fairly close to each other.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hugh Grant (Executives)】\nAnd then, Jeff, the same question on dicamba. So we said it would be a 3- to 5-year investment stream. So the front end of this will be the thin end as we do engineering and early spec-ing. The market -- so 20%, Brett? 30%?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Brett Begemann (Executives)】\nYes, it'll be in that range, and part of this is the investment in the basic infrastructure to prepare for the development so that you could add additional capacity for far less cost after the initial installation's put in place. You could add another train.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hugh Grant (Executives)】\nBut somewhere in the 20% to 30% range would be -- of future market demand because the market today is quite small. But in classic Monsanto fashion, we'll be creating that market and then supplying it. But that would be a rough guideline.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Begleiter (Analysts)】\nHugh, on corn gross profit, given the pressure on gross margins next year from lower acres or production, can you still -- is it possible to grow corn gross profit next year, given the pressure on margins?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hugh Grant (Executives)】\nYes, I mean, we are -- and Pierre mentioned this in terms of production. We've seen acres skinnying down in Latin America, so the early read there is acres are going to be crimped. We're anticipating -- you look at the challenges this year in corn, so we are anticipating that next year will be a tighter market, and we're more blessed within this that we've got a balanced portfolio. So what we're losing in corn, we're seeing a really nice uptick in beans. But Brett, maybe a little bit on how you see margin and the growth opportunities next year.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Brett Begemann (Executives)】\nI think the really good news on this in corn is, as I mentioned, our portfolio is as strong as it's ever been. We continue to see farmers migrating to our best hybrids, in other words, our newest hybrids, which gives us the opportunity to continue to get portfolio mix lift from our germplasm. And we believe that that's going to continue. We will continue to face the headwinds of acres. And when we face the headwinds of acres and the softness that Pierre mentioned in South America, that translates into an impact in COGS because it lowers our production and the absorption of our fixed cost. So we feel really good about our position going into '16, albeit it's going to be a challenging market, not unlike what '15 was. And that's going to have an impact on margins, and we'll be a lot more clear on that as we start to finalize projections for '16.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Christopher Parkinson (Analysts)】\nRegarding your Channel brand and Seedsman growth initiatives, can you update us on the potential margin improvement here and the best way to think about this geographically, i.e. are there any U.S. regional limitations? And also, is the portfolio refresh here done at the same rate as DEKALB?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hugh Grant (Executives)】\nSo nice -- so Chris, we've, from an operational point of view, seen some really good improvements in the Channel piece. I'm not sure. I think service to growers and operational, we're better. I don't know if that converts yet into a margin uptick. Brett?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Brett Begemann (Executives)】\nYes, I think the primary focus with the change that we made in Channel was changing the relationship and experience with the customer to provide better service and real-time management of inventories in season, and that's gone really well. We feel good about how we made that transition. It really wasn't intended to be a significant margin improvement. There could be a little bit as we continue to improve our overall service there. To your other part of your question, do we refresh the Channel brand like we do DEKALB, each of those decisions are made independently. But yes, we do refresh the Channel brand, and we do bring new products into that portfolio every year, just like we do in DEKALB. And those metrics would be very similar between those 2 brands.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Joel Jackson (Analysts)】\nAnd again, talking about how you're giving it months to try to have a Syngenta deal done, what has to happen? Or is it a possibility that you could look at an unsolicited offer that you would take directly to Syngenta shareholders? How long would you have to wait to have that happen? And what would have to happen for that to be a suitable outcome?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hugh Grant (Executives)】\nI think there's miles in the journey before we get to that. I think the first step on this -- and I'm very encouraged by the early progress, but the first step on this is direct engagement with their shareowners and explaining, as I've done this morning, the vision that we see for this. There's been a lot of talk around these integrated solutions. There's not been much success historically. And I think the more we talk about the difference between talking and doing, the more interest there is in the vision and the strategy. So I think for us, the near term is the continued outreach to their shareowners and the continued outreach to Syngenta to encourage them to sit down and do this face to face rather than through YouTube and leaked documents. So I'm hoping that we get to a point where we're actually sitting and talking. Your path is always a potential, but my preference would be a friendly deal with the 2 chairmen of these 2 companies.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Roberts (Analysts)】\nWhen you talk about additional upfront licensing fees potentially in '16, is this more Xtend dicamba-related? Or are there other opportunities on Roundup equal to the size of the Scotts deal you just did?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hugh Grant (Executives)】\nYes. John, thanks for the question. I mean, we've been doing this for years. We talked very early on about architecture and always expanding our licensing opportunity. The one that's front and center, and it's in field trials this year, that I would -- and Pierre kind of alluded to this in his comments, is Corn Rootworm III. So it's next-generation corn rootworm control. We have it in collaborator trials. They'll be doing root digs in the next few weeks, when we can get out of the rain and see ground drying out. So that's one that I'd probably put front and foremost.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Koort (Analysts)】\nOn the dicamba investment, I'm curious in the interim, before your own facility starts, how you would source that, given, I think, you're going to use a new formulation to reduce the volatilization. And will it be a branded product and managed in the same manner that you manage Roundup?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hugh Grant (Executives)】\nYes. The short answer would be yes. But Brett, maybe just a little bit of flavor around it. We've done a lot work in formulations. We're encouraged there, and also third-party supplies and collaborators.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Brett Begemann (Executives)】\nYes. So the way we're looking at this, Bob, is we're -- if you think about this in stages, getting the products into the marketplace, and there's enough dicamba out there that already supplies about 20% of the market and then -- and we are sourcing some of that. You may recall some months ago, we made the announcement of an investment at our Muscatine facility in a formulation plant, where, yes, we are making our own branded product that we're going to sell in the marketplace. And it is an advanced formulation that brings benefit to the farmers. So we'll do that from sourced material in the near term, and we'll continue to do that until we build our own capacity and bring that online. But it'll -- along the way, we'll continue to use some of those sources that are out there that already have dicamba. So it'll be a combination of all of those.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Vincent Andrews (Analysts)】\nI might have missed this because I had to hop off for a second, but did you talk at all about any progress update on getting the Chinese approval for Xtend?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hugh Grant (Executives)】\nWe did not. We see nice progress in Europe and China. As is traditionally the case, China will be the last piece of this process to come through, but no new news. But we -- I mean, our experience has been China is usually the last piece of this, but China has generally been predictable, and they need beans, so we feel pretty optimistic. But no news, Vincent.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Vincent Andrews (Analysts)】\nIs there a go or no-go date by which you need approval in order to be confident for next year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Brett Begemann (Executives)】\nI wouldn't necessarily think of it as go or no-go date. We're producing seed this year with the anticipation that we will be in the market in 2016, so that -- I guess I would call that already a go. As we get closer to 2016 with the anticipated approval out of China, we'll make those decisions on how we manage that next year. But that will be decisions that will be made in conjunction with our grower customers and the rest of the industry sitting down, working together on this and decide what we do. But at this point, our focus is totally on the China approval. We provided them all the information necessary to make a decision, so we'll stay focused on driving that decision so that we don't have to address the other side of it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Connelly (Analysts)】\nSo a couple of quarters back, I asked you about your confidence broadly in getting paid in Argentina. And since then, most of the news flow is the same as always, just chaotic and negative. And you mentioned the POD and that 70% of farmers are paying upfront. My question is, do you think we're headed towards a model where we pay upfront across Brazil and Argentina? And are you thinking any differently about the saved seed issue in soy in Argentina, given what the government's been saying?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hugh Grant (Executives)】\nMark, thanks for the questions. So I think your summary on the news flow looks the same as always, it's chaotic. I think it's just -- it's life in Argentina. When you go down there and you talk to growers, there's tremendous enthusiasm and a pent-up demand for these technologies and the other ones that are coming down the pike. So you have to kind of climb above the noise and look at the macro environment. And I think the evidence -- and your point is exactly right. The evidence is we're seeing growers morph more and more towards buying new bags, but the backstop of POD continues to be important. I mean, Brett, you've been looking at this the last few weeks.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Brett Begemann (Executives)】\nYes, I think I would just remind you to think about the early months and years when we put the system in place in Brazil. It was pretty noisy there, too. And I think we're hearing a lot of the same thing out of Argentina. But there's, as Hugh mentioned, tremendous interest in the product.

And it'll be noisy, but we're still confident it'll move in the right direction.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Brett Wong (Analysts)】\nJust talking about Climate Pro since we didn't really talk about that at all or Climate Corp. I'm just wondering, the step-up in orders you saw the past month, what was leading that for the Climate Pro users? Is that around more favorable pricing? And then on top of that, as you look at how that product offering ramps, how do you see kind of that scale up and ramping current [ph] and the pricing coming back?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hugh Grant (Executives)】\nSo I'll ask Brett to give you a little bit of granular detail. Let me just start by saying we're delighted with the progress. It isn't financially material yet, but it does prove out the system. And the link to my earlier comments on Syngenta, what we're seeing this year with some of the nitrogen -- and it's still early. But what we're seeing this year with some of the Nitrogen Advisor work, I think, bridges beautifully into bringing chemistry up onto that acre. So what we do in nitrogen, there's the opportunity of doing in the future with chemistry and giving the farmer much better advice on when and how he applies chemistry. But still early days, Brett, but some great numbers on the board.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Brett Begemann (Executives)】\nYes, we're really excited about it. If you look at the early days of the Climate Pro, which were the paid acres this year, I'd say it was driven by the nitrogen model, which gave farmers lots of insights, particularly in some areas this year that were kind of difficult with the early planting season and lots of rain, et cetera, in some areas.

It confirms, again, that farmers understand intuitively they have this variability in the field, and they believe that it can be addressed, and they're willing to work with us to figure out how to do that. So it's an exciting start with that platform.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rory Blake (Analysts)】\nThis is actually Rory Blake in for Frank Mitsch. I just had a couple of quick ones. On the dicamba side, I thought that we were still waiting for regulatory approval on the in-crop use. Is there any update there? And then also, just changing gears a little on the crop -- on The Climate Corporation side, obviously, a nice number on the free offering, a nice number on the premium offering. How should we think about the adoption rate? And is there any change in how we're thinking about pricing for it?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hugh Grant (Executives)】\nI'm sorry, on the second piece, adoption rate on what, sorry?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rory Blake (Analysts)】\nThe adoption rate on the Pro side and also the pricing of it.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hugh Grant (Executives)】\nOh, okay.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Brett Begemann (Executives)】\nI think there's 2 pieces in there. On the dicamba side, I believe you're referring to the chemistry over-the-top label, and that is work in process, and we're optimistic on that one. We put cotton in the marketplace this year. And because we had 3 herbicide tolerances there where the farmer could use 2 of them this year, and that's what we used to kind of set the tone on pricing, but we feel really good with our U.S. approach on the over-the-top for dicamba. The other piece on Climate Pro, there's 2 things, and I think it's -- I'm still in the camp that says the most important thing is to develop the robust platform for data sciences for farmers. And it's less about how much profitability we can get in the early years and how much pricing there is in the early years. It's about getting farmers established on a platform that helps them improve the decision-making both before planting, at planting and throughout raising the crop. And that's going to continue to be our focus. Obviously, farmers are demonstrating they see value in it, and they are paying for those services this year. And we'll continue to look at the value that we bring and price into that. But the primary focus in the next couple of years will be continuing to expand that platform.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hugh Grant (Executives)】\nI think that platform play, data becomes the glue that holds the chemistry, the seed and the biotech together. And we are uniquely positioned, and that reminds me so much of the early days of skepticism in biotech and then skepticism in linking biotech and breeding and even the skepticism when we change platforms with 2s and with SmartStax. So we're going to have to demonstrate that. And I would expect that in demonstrating that we can bring these technologies together, we get the opportunity one more time to license that to the rest of the chemical industry.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Piken (Analysts)】\nI was just wondering if you could just give us a little more color on some of the restructuring in terms of some of the buckets that you anticipate things coming from. And specifically, are you planning to cut R&D as well? Or is it more OpEx spending?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hugh Grant (Executives)】\nIt's more -- it's much more focused -- and Brett mentioned -- went through some of this earlier, but it's much more on driving efficiency and the use of new technologies. And in R&D this year, we quietly retooled the big piece around breeding. And we think that our breeding programs will be faster, will yield more and cost less. So we actually use that as a surrogate as we look at other opportunities across the company. But it's the application of data science in a number of fields that we think we can streamline and get better and faster.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hugh Grant (Executives)】\nSo thanks, thank you very much, and thanks. We've stayed a little bit long today, so thanks for your patience and your support. I guess in summary, I'd say our business and our pipeline are stronger than they've ever been, and yet -- and this is classic Monsanto -- we continue to challenge ourselves to advance new solutions and provide even more robust tools for farmers around the globe regardless of their size. So with the proposal that I started talking about today, our proposal of combining with Syngenta, we are looking beyond the short-term macro challenges that face agriculture to, once again, drive the next evolution. Many in the industry have theorized. There's been a lot of talk about integrated strategies. But I think, as I said earlier, there's a difference between talking and doing. And we believe we're best positioned with our strong seed footprint and our leading digital ag platform to make this a reality, providing us with an opportunity to be an even stronger partner to growers. So we simply have the proven track record that demands consideration to be the partner of choice in leading this evolution. We appreciate the continued support of the respective owners in driving that dialogue and driving that engagement. So I want to conclude by thanking you for joining us on the call today. Thanks very much.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you, Holly. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information, can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website. On the call today are Executive Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison; and CEOs Safra Catz and Mark Hurd.\r\nAs a reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today's discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business, which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements.\r\nThese forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from the statements being made today. As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, and we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments, for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock.\r\nAnd finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or publicly release any revisions to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we'll begin with some prepared remarks. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Safra.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Ken. I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q4 and fiscal 2015. I'll then review guidance for Q1 and then turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments.\r\nAs you probably remember, I didn't provide U.S. dollar guidance for Q4 given the unusually high volatility in exchange rates. The currency headwind ended up being higher than consensus estimates would reflect, with 8% to Software and Cloud revenue as well as the total company revenue, 9% for hardware revenue and $0.09 for earnings per share. Currencies continue to move significantly and remain unpredictable, so my comments today generally reflect constant dollar growth rate, which is how we look at the business.\r\nWe are delighted with our results, with the most important thing being that we dramatically overachieved in the Cloud. This is the first Q4 where we had everything together for the Cloud. We had the products that we've been working on for a decade, the operations, the sales force and the references with many, many happy customers. Having all that in place caused SaaS, PaaS bookings to grow more than 200%, our best ever growth rate for Cloud bookings and more than $125 million higher than our own $300 million goal. For most companies, as their business grows, the growth rates go down. In our case, as the business grows, our growth rates are increasing.\r\nSo to the numbers. Cloud SaaS and PaaS revenue was 400 -- I'm doing only non-GAAP, was $419 million, up 34% from last year and well above the high end of my guidance. As our cloud bookings growth continues to accelerate, so too will our cloud revenue growth. As I just said, bookings grew more than 200%, further adding to the momentum, which is helping drive SaaS and PaaS growth.\r\nNow when you translate the $125 million higher is from SaaS and PaaS to having been historically, our license business, it probably would have been around $375 million more in license, and it would all have been booked immediately, not ratably over time. So for us, this was actually fantastic news.\r\nWhen bookings ultimately turn into revenue, it depends, of course, on many factors. But one thing is clear, our momentum in the cloud bodes very well for the future. Combined with Infrastructure as a Service revenue of $160 million, which was up 31%, our total cloud revenue in the quarter was $579 million.\r\nEngineered Systems continued to -- excuse me, sorry. To help you further understand just how well we are doing in the cloud, I thought it would be helpful to compare our cloud billings growth rate to that of our principal cloud competitors. Billings is generally defined as total \trevenue in the period plus the sequential change in gross deferred revenue. Our practice at Oracle regarding deferred revenue has always been to net out the billed but unpaid invoices from our deferred revenue balance on our balance sheet.\r\nI believe that our cloud competitors follow a practice where they disclose only a gross deferred revenue book balance, not net for uncollected invoices. So we've put up a spreadsheet on our website to show you the same thing for comparability. We've calculated Oracle's cloud billings using our competitors' methodology or the sum of total cloud revenue plus the sequential change in gross deferred revenue.\r\nWhat it shows is that billings grew from $468 million in fiscal 2014 fourth quarter to $834 million in this just finished quarter. That's a growth rate of more than 70% in U.S. dollars. And though there may be seasonality to billings numbers, this is dramatically faster than Salesforce's 21% billings growth and Workday's 31% billings growth in their most recently reported quarter. In summary, our cloud business is significantly outpacing the competition.\r\nNow total software revenues were $8.4 billion, with software updates and product support revenues at $4.7 billion, up 8% from last year (sic) [quarter]. Attach and renewal rates remained at their usual high levels as our growing installed base of customers continues to power earnings and cash flow. New software license revenue were $3.1 billion, reflecting the accelerated migration to cloud. The shift to cloud was very pronounced in Europe, where new software license sales were most impacted. But Europe was also our fastest-growing region for both cloud revenue and bookings, as you would expect from the substitution.\r\nTotal hardware, including hardware support, grew 5% with hardware system product revenue of $818 million and hardware support revenue of $590 million. Engineered Systems continue to be strong with double-digit bookings growth, and we continue to take share from IBM and HP.\r\nFor the company, total revenue for the quarter was $10.7 billion, up 3% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $5 billion and the operating margin was 46%, with currency and MICROS lowering operating margin by 2%. That we're able to maintain our industry-leading operating margins with MICROS and while growing our cloud business dramatically is a testimony to the strength of our business model.\r\nWhile we believe our overachievement in cloud bookings will be much more valuable in both revenue and earnings over time, cloud revenue is recognized ratably unlike new license, which is recognized upfront. This shift has the effect of lowering near-term earnings per share but, over time, will increase it significantly.\r\nSo for example, a $1 million license deal, which would be recognized upfront dropped right to the bottom line, would ultimately result in about $3 million in revenue over 10 years. A $1 million SaaS, PaaS booking -- of SaaS booking results in $10 million over that same time period. I would not trade the cloud revenue for the license revenue, as cloud revenues and cloud bookings mean significantly more in revenues and earnings over time.\r\nThe non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was at 25.5%, and EPS was $0.78 in U.S. dollars, $0.09 lower due to currency. The GAAP tax rate was 25.4%, and the GAAP EPS was USD 0.62, $0.08 lower due to currency. Both tax rates were significantly higher than my guidance and were the result of multiple factors but generally relate to the mix of earnings between the U.S. and other jurisdictions, with the U.S. being a larger percentage of our quarter in recognized revenue than we forecast.\r\nFor the fiscal 2015, total Software and Cloud revenues totaled $29.5 billion, growing 5% in constant currency. Cloud SaaS and PaaS were $1.5 billion, growing 34%. Cloud Infrastructure as a Service was $608 million, growing 36%. New software license was $8.5 billion, and software support was $18.9 billion, growing 8%. Hardware systems revenue was $5.2 billion, growing 1%. Services revenue was $3.5 billion, essentially unchanged from last year. Total revenue grew 4% to $38.3 billion. Our non-GAAP operating margin for the full year was 45%, and non-GAAP earnings per share were $2.77.\r\nFree cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $12.9 billion. Capital expenditures continue to be higher as we provision existing orders and build out SaaS and PaaS -- for SaaS and PaaS growth. As a reminder, our cloud data centers are built using our own Engineered Systems, so while CapEx is a cost to other cloud providers, a good portion of our CapEx is essentially a hardware sale, which we sell as a cloud subscription.\r\nWe now have $54 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is approximately $12.4 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $7.2 billion, up 9% in constant currency. As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend. In terms of acquisitions, we continue to focus on finding the right companies at the right valuation and both are critically important.\r\nThis quarter, we again repurchased 4.6 million shares for a total of $2 billion. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased more than 193 million shares for a total of $8.1 billion. We paid out dividends of $2.3 billion for a total that is 8% -- 80% of our free cash flow. And the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of 15% -- $0.15 per share.\r\nNow to the guidance. We feel very good about our own performance but, of course, we are keeping an eye on the macro environment, especially abroad. Additionally, given the continued high volatility in exchange rates, we expect currency will affect results but, as of now, we just don't know how much. So I'm going to, again, provide constant currency guidance, though I would take our results as some idea for what we think what currencies are doing right around now.\r\nClearly, customers are migrating to Oracle cloud at even faster rate, and my guidance reflects this accelerating mix shift. Since we are starting a new year, I am going to make some changes in my guidance. I am dropping some things, including smaller components of cloud, and I'm dropping GAAP guidance, which both -- best match how we look at the business. All of my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency.\r\nSo here it goes. SaaS and PaaS revenue is expected to grow between 39% and 43%. Software and Cloud revenue, including SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, new software license and software support, is expected to grow between 6% and 8%. Total revenue growth is expected to range from 5% to 8%. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be somewhere between $0.56 and $0.59. This assumes a non-GAAP tax rate of 25.5%. Of course, if this quarter is any example, it may end up being very different.\r\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Mark.\n\n---\n\nJust a couple of quick comments, Safra, to add. I think, one, Safra told you about the 34% year-on-year SaaS, PaaS revenue growth, that was 12% sequential growth and almost entirely organic. We talked about the billings growth of 70%, now faster than Salesforce or Workday. Bookings of $426 million was 200%-plus growth for Q4.\r\nLet me give you some customer numbers. We added 1,217 SaaS customers in the quarter, new. 760 customers expanded. By pillar, HCM added 312 new customers in the quarter, 933 for the year, 3x Workday's total customer growth over the last 4 quarters. In Customer Experience, we added 657 customers in Q4, 1,900 -- almost 1,900 for the year.\r\nIn ERP, we added 380 customers in Q4 and 888 for the year. Our installed base is now almost 1,100 ERP customers in the cloud, nearly 10x the size of Workday. And let me add, we really never see SAP. In PaaS, we added 1,419 customers in Q4. Let me just repeat, that was 1,419 customers in 1 quarter. We booked over $100 million and grew 100% sequentially.\r\nWe're now at scale. Our cloud revenue is already above a $2.3 billion run rate. We added $858 million in ARR this year. $858 million. So using the conversion that Safra used a little while ago, that would be almost $2.5 billion in license. And we expect to sell between $1.5 billion and $2 billion in ARR next year. We're now growing faster than both Salesforce and Workday, and we expect revenue growth next year could be as high in SaaS, PaaS as 60%.\r\nNow I've given you a lot of numbers to reflect on, but when you look at customer accounts, booking, revenue, the result is the same. We're doing what you very rarely ever see happen in our industry. We are getting bigger and our growth rate is expanding. We will be the world's largest enterprise cloud company. With that, let me turn it over to Larry.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Mark. Well, Mark gave you a lot of interesting numbers, and I'd like to drill into a couple of them. First, I'd like to look at our sales growth rates of cloud applications, SaaS and platform services, PaaS. I'm intentionally leaving out our cloud infrastructure business so I can do an apples-to-apples comparison with Salesforce.com, which does not sell Infrastructure as a Service.\r\nOkay. Last year, in FY '15, as Mark just said, we sold $858 million of new SaaS and PaaS business. About half of that, $426 million, was sold in Q4. That's a year-over-year Q4 sales growth rate of over 200%. More importantly, the $426 million is more SaaS and PaaS new business than has ever been sold by any cloud services company in a single quarter. It's a record. Clearly, our cloud business has entered a hypergrowth phase.\r\nThis year, in FY '16, we plan on selling between $1.5 billion and $2 billion of new SaaS and PaaS business. In other words, we plan to sell at least twice as much as we sold last year. And that's at least 50% more new business than Salesforce.com will sell in their current fiscal year.\r\nAnd if we exceed our plan like we did this Q4, we could book twice as much new business than Salesforce.com. Now, I don't think that's likely that we'll sell double what Salesforce.com sells, but it's definitely possible.\r\nSecond, let's look at the impact these record sales rates have on SaaS and PaaS revenue. In Q4 of FY '15, our SaaS and PaaS revenue grew 35% in constant currency. Because our cloud sales had dramatically accelerated, our SaaS and PaaS revenues are planned to grow at 60% in FY '16, unaided by any new acquisitions. So our cloud service -- so our cloud business is much bigger than Workday, and we will grow faster than Workday will this year.\r\nOur cloud SaaS and PaaS revenue is still second to Salesforce.com, but we're growing much, much faster than they are. So it won't be long before we pass them. How and why is this happening? Our SaaS growth is due to the rapid acceptance of our new generation of Fusion applications. We now have over 1,000 Fusion ERP customers, around 10x more than Workday. Mark said that once, I'm going to say it twice, around 10x more than Workday.\r\nWorkday says they never see SAP in the cloud ERP market. That's the one thing Oracle and Workday agree on. It's between us, Oracle and Workday, in the mid-market and the high end of the cloud ERP market and we are winning big time. We are the clear #1 in cloud ERP and we are #1 or #2 in most other SaaS categories, including HCM, sales, service, marketing, EPM, supply chain and so on. We have a lot more SaaS applications than any other enterprise SaaS company.\r\nOur PaaS growth is due to the huge pent-up demand with the Oracle Database and Java Middleware as a Service. Our customers can now move their Oracle databases and Java applications to the cloud with the push of a button, that's why our PaaS business has grown even faster than our SaaS business. Things are good for Oracle in the cloud.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Larry. Before we go to the Q&A, Holly, if we could just have one quick clarification. Share repurchases in Q4 were 46 million shares. With that, I'll turn it over to you.",

Capital expenditures continue to be higher as we provision existing orders and build out SaaS and PaaS -- for SaaS and PaaS growth. As a reminder, our cloud data centers are built using our own Engineered Systems, so while CapEx is a cost to other cloud providers, a good portion of our CapEx is essentially a hardware sale, which we sell as a cloud subscription.\r\nWe now have $54 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is approximately $12.4 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $7.2 billion, up 9% in constant currency. As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend. In terms of acquisitions, we continue to focus on finding the right companies at the right valuation and both are critically important.\r\nThis quarter, we again repurchased 4.6 million shares for a total of $2 billion. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased more than 193 million shares for a total of $8.1 billion. We paid out dividends of $2.3 billion for a total that is 8% -- 80% of our free cash flow. And the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of 15% -- $0.15 per share.\r\nNow to the guidance. We feel very good about our own performance but, of course, we are keeping an eye on the macro environment, especially abroad. Additionally, given the continued high volatility in exchange rates, we expect currency will affect results but, as of now, we just don't know how much. So I'm going to, again, provide constant currency guidance, though I would take our results as some idea for what we think what currencies are doing right around now.\r\nClearly, customers are migrating to Oracle cloud at even faster rate, and my guidance reflects this accelerating mix shift. Since we are starting a new year, I am going to make some changes in my guidance. I am dropping some things, including smaller components of cloud, and I'm dropping GAAP guidance, which both -- best match how we look at the business. All of my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency.\r\nSo here it goes. SaaS and PaaS revenue is expected to grow between 39% and 43%. Software and Cloud revenue, including SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, new software license and software support, is expected to grow between 6% and 8%. Total revenue growth is expected to range from 5% to 8%. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be somewhere between $0.56 and $0.59. This assumes a non-GAAP tax rate of 25.5%. Of course, if this quarter is any example, it may end up being very different.\r\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Mark.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Mark Hurd (Executives)】\nJust a couple of quick comments, Safra, to add. I think, one, Safra told you about the 34% year-on-year SaaS, PaaS revenue growth, that was 12% sequential growth and almost entirely organic. We talked about the billings growth of 70%, now faster than Salesforce or Workday. Bookings of $426 million was 200%-plus growth for Q4.\r\nLet me give you some customer numbers. We added 1,217 SaaS customers in the quarter, new. 760 customers expanded. By pillar, HCM added 312 new customers in the quarter, 933 for the year, 3x Workday's total customer growth over the last 4 quarters. In Customer Experience, we added 657 customers in Q4, 1,900 -- almost 1,900 for the year.\r\nIn ERP, we added 380 customers in Q4 and 888 for the year. Our installed base is now almost 1,100 ERP customers in the cloud, nearly 10x the size of Workday. And let me add, we really never see SAP. In PaaS, we added 1,419 customers in Q4. Let me just repeat, that was 1,419 customers in 1 quarter. We booked over $100 million and grew 100% sequentially.\r\nWe're now at scale. Our cloud revenue is already above a $2.3 billion run rate. We added $858 million in ARR this year. $858 million. So using the conversion that Safra used a little while ago, that would be almost $2.5 billion in license. And we expect to sell between $1.5 billion and $2 billion in ARR next year. We're now growing faster than both Salesforce and Workday, and we expect revenue growth next year could be as high in SaaS, PaaS as 60%.\r\nNow I've given you a lot of numbers to reflect on, but when you look at customer accounts, booking, revenue, the result is the same. We're doing what you very rarely ever see happen in our industry. We are getting bigger and our growth rate is expanding. We will be the world's largest enterprise cloud company. With that, let me turn it over to Larry.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Lawrence Ellison (Executives)】\nThank you, Mark. Well, Mark gave you a lot of interesting numbers, and I'd like to drill into a couple of them. First, I'd like to look at our sales growth rates of cloud applications, SaaS and platform services, PaaS. I'm intentionally leaving out our cloud infrastructure business so I can do an apples-to-apples comparison with Salesforce.com, which does not sell Infrastructure as a Service.\r\nOkay. Last year, in FY '15, as Mark just said, we sold $858 million of new SaaS and PaaS business. About half of that, $426 million, was sold in Q4. That's a year-over-year Q4 sales growth rate of over 200%. More importantly, the $426 million is more SaaS and PaaS new business than has ever been sold by any cloud services company in a single quarter. It's a record. Clearly, our cloud business has entered a hypergrowth phase.\r\nThis year, in FY '16, we plan on selling between $1.5 billion and $2 billion of new SaaS and PaaS business. In other words, we plan to sell at least twice as much as we sold last year. And that's at least 50% more new business than Salesforce.com will sell in their current fiscal year.\r\nAnd if we exceed our plan like we did this Q4, we could book twice as much new business than Salesforce.com. Now, I don't think that's likely that we'll sell double what Salesforce.com sells, but it's definitely possible.\r\nSecond, let's look at the impact these record sales rates have on SaaS and PaaS revenue. In Q4 of FY '15, our SaaS and PaaS revenue grew 35% in constant currency. Because our cloud sales had dramatically accelerated, our SaaS and PaaS revenues are planned to grow at 60% in FY '16, unaided by any new acquisitions. So our cloud service -- so our cloud business is much bigger than Workday, and we will grow faster than Workday will this year.\r\nOur cloud SaaS and PaaS revenue is still second to Salesforce.com, but we're growing much, much faster than they are. So it won't be long before we pass them. How and why is this happening? Our SaaS growth is due to the rapid acceptance of our new generation of Fusion applications. We now have over 1,000 Fusion ERP customers, around 10x more than Workday. Mark said that once, I'm going to say it twice, around 10x more than Workday.\r\nWorkday says they never see SAP in the cloud ERP market. That's the one thing Oracle and Workday agree on. It's between us, Oracle and Workday, in the mid-market and the high end of the cloud ERP market and we are winning big time. We are the clear #1 in cloud ERP and we are #1 or #2 in most other SaaS categories, including HCM, sales, service, marketing, EPM, supply chain and so on. We have a lot more SaaS applications than any other enterprise SaaS company.\r\nOur PaaS growth is due to the huge pent-up demand with the Oracle Database and Java Middleware as a Service. Our customers can now move their Oracle databases and Java applications to the cloud with the push of a button, that's why our PaaS business has grown even faster than our SaaS business. Things are good for Oracle in the cloud.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Ken Bond (Executives)】\nThank you, Larry. Before we go to the Q&A, Holly, if we could just have one quick clarification. Share repurchases in Q4 were 46 million shares. With that, I'll turn it over to you.",
      "transcript_text3": "Look, Oracle wasn't the first and won't be the last software company to go through this shift from selling upfront perpetual to ratable subscription licensing. And so the metrics that we were used to are obviously changing, and you guys gave a lot of color around the current quarter. And what I hope maybe we could do is drill down a little bit more on the longer-term impact of the model in customer lifetime value. And I know in your 10-year example, you generate more revenue with subscription. Can you guys talk a little bit about what you think the ballpark breakeven point is on a hypothetical deal, what happens to margins over this time and, ultimately, how this is going to impact cash flow?\n\n---\n\nI'll repeat what Safra said. Okay, let's take $1 million deal. If it's licensed over a 10-year period, you get the $1 million upfront for the license and you get 20% a year for 10 years. That's another $2 million for over a 10-year period, you get a total of $3 million. And after the cost of sales, it's a very profitable business. Most of that $3 million, again, after the cost of sales, is profit. In a $1 million SaaS or PaaS deal, you don't get anything upfront but you have to pay the commissions. And then you only get -- and that $1 million deal is worth $10 million or more than 3x as much as the license deal over a 10-year period, over triple the value. But the accounting is entirely different. The accounting, you take it ratably over that 10-year period, so you have to pay the commissions upfront and recognize the expenses upfront and you get 10 years. Okay, so what's the profitability on SaaS and PaaS? It's -- this is going to shock you, it's about the same as license and support. It's stunningly profitable. Infrastructure as a Service is very different. Again, I'm talking about SaaS and PaaS. Infrastructure as a Service, the margins aren't nearly so high, though we make money in the Infrastructure as a Service. But you can see what Amazon's profit margins are on Infrastructure as a Service, we think it can be a profitable business when you get scale. But SaaS and PaaS is very similar to license. So that $1 million, which turned into something less than $3 million in profit after you get to scale in license, turns into something less than $10 million in profits, say, $9 million in profit over the 10-year period of -- that you're providing the service. So it's a much better business for us in terms of revenue, margin -- the revenue goes way up, the profits go way up. And the margins are approximately the same.\n\n---\n\nI think we have a huge advantage, Jason, that some of our competitors don't have. We make most of the components for the cloud service ourselves.\n\n---\n\nYes. Again, Salesforce paid us a lot of money for their platform. They buy Exadata from us to run their data center. They buy the Oracle Database. They paid a lot of money for the Oracle Database. So -- by the way, we just signed an Oracle Database deal, so SAP could run Concur. We signed an Oracle Database deal, this is all in the last 12 months, so SAP can run Ariba. We signed an Oracle Database deal so SAP could run SuccessFactors. We get a really good deal on the Oracle Database, on Java Middleware, on Exadata and all of those things. So our expense profile is very, very different. By the way, it's interesting. SAP does not use HANA in the cloud very much. I know that because they keep paying us. Again this quarter, they pay us for Oracle for Concur, and Oracle for Ariba, and Oracle for SuccessFactors. If they're using HANA for anything, I don't know about it.\n\n---\n\nJason, just to add one thing that as you talked about the conversion from license to ratable, I gave the stat last quarter, but I'll give it again for this quarter. Last quarter, I think I said that 82% of our cloud SaaS deals were actually not Oracle customers of an application when they acquired or contracted for a SaaS application. This quarter, it was over 60%. So these are -- this is not just a conversion of Oracle customers -- Oracle application customers to SaaS. This is a lot of greenfield new market share for Oracle as well.\n\n---\n\nYes. I've got a follow-up to what Mark just said. So the SaaS market is much bigger than the license market. I think as Mark is saying, we can go much further down market, get the customers we could never get to before because the SaaS service is much easier to consume for a midsize company than buying a computer, opening a data center, hiring a bunch of people and running licensed software. So we think the available market is dramatically larger [ph].\n\n---\n\nYes, the global mid-market is now available to us unlike it would have been in the traditional license model. And it's very exciting.\n\n---\n\nI wanted to drill down on the cloud numbers, especially how they stood up relative to license. The license missed in the quarter, that's consensus, by about $273 million. Obviously, that's very much due to that shift over to cloud in terms of accounting structure, in terms of structure? Is that all due to that? Or is there some impact, anything negative that we should read fundamentally from the license miss in either Database apps or Middleware?\n\n---\n\nOkay. So first of all, I didn't give guidance regarding license. So whatever number you put in your spreadsheet, we didn't make that number, okay?\n\n---\n\nNo, I just meant relative to consensus, that's all.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Relative to all of you who have a lot of spreadsheets. So -- however, the reality is, I think that you can see the most instruction from what happened in Europe. Our Europe new license was down a lot. Our Europe cloud was huge. So it was -- for them, they focused all in, they went all in on pushing cloud and that's where the focus went. Other than that, I think if we're going to talk about spreadsheets that I did not actually guide you to, in currency, I think you all missed the boat there, too, a bit. But that's okay. We got another quarter now and -- but the truth is that yes, our customers are focusing on cloud as are our sales force. We have a lot of references. And when a customer comes to us, to the extent that they are a good candidate for cloud, which they are, we are going to be talking about cloud, we are going to be selling cloud, and we would much rather have a cloud booking for -- as I said, for $1 million than we would for a class -- for a licensed deal, which I book all the way, right upfront, throw out to the bottom line, I would much rather have a cloud booking for $1 million than a new license dollar. And we are pushing that conversion quickly.\n\n---\n\nJust a little bit more. I mean, no region missed its CD forecast with the exception of Europe. So just to be clear, CD forecast at your -- when you're talking about dollars from a CD perspective, every region executed as we expected in license with the exception of Europe. Europe had phenomenal cloud quarter inclusive of probably one of the most exciting financials in the cloud deal we've seen at HSBC. So some very exciting transactions in Europe. And they definitely made the shift. But to whatever you have in your numbers on a local basis, no region missed its CD forecast and license with exception of Europe that had a material shift to the cloud in the quarter, including some pretty exciting deals like what I just described.\n\n---\n\nSafra, I know our spreadsheets are nowhere near as good as yours are. But just to follow up a little bit. Q4 used to be -- you'd always characterize it as Mardi Gras for Oracle from a license revenue perspective. And now that this transition seems to be happening so swiftly, it would seem -- in Q1, you would always have this big sequential dropoff. And I know you don't specifically talk about license revenue, but given we're all trying to get a hang of how to think about the company's seasonality going forward, should we think about Q4 -- the dynamic for Q4 seasonality is going to become a little bit more muted -- continue to become more muted as you have this success transitioning? But then again Q1, which used to be a quarter where license revenue used to have such a big sequential decline, maybe Q1 gets a little bit easier? Is there any way you can help us think about the seasonal changes?\n\n---\n\nYes, Heather, you have got it actually exactly nailed correctly. The reality is that cloud is growing sequentially generally, regardless. So Q1 in revenues, Q1 cloud is not going to be a giant dropoff from Q4. I know. My team here is telling me it's going up. I completely -- I just gave the guidance. So yes. So Heather, you have that right. So the seasonality for the whole company is muted. It is still true that our -- that from a bookings point of view and things like that, Q4 is Mardi Gras and it's still Mardi Gras. But revenue smooths out. New license, which was always just so, so enormous in Q4 it takes a giant dropoff, it becomes less and less important. So in total revenue, the seasonality smooths out a bit. And -- but of course, our new license numbers are still very big numbers. But in Q1, they're a much smaller percentage of the total than they are in Q4.\n\n---\n\nI do think it's worth noting, Heather, that in Q4 for us on a cloud bookings basis, we came in with a forecast that we had, which was what we talked about at the end of Q3 with the conference call. And every week, this forecast got better. Every week. There was not a single -- I gave an example of one deal but there is no gargantuan transaction in there. There is no dominant region. There is no dominant pillar. It is consistent by pillar, by geography. And it was a very consistent, steady move every week as we advanced through Q4.\n\n---\n\nI'm not going to ask you a spreadsheet question, but I want to ask about databases. Any commentary on the new license sales of database directionally, how it trended? And also an update on 12c adoption, what percentage of the base is on 12c? And any quantification you can provide on the options, that will be good.\n\n---\n\n12c was good in the quarter. I think we gave you a comparison last quarter, but if we compared it to '11, we've been about 50% faster in feature adoptions of 12c than we were at '11, so it was very strong. And if you went by region, you saw a tremendous performance in database in North America, even in license. And you saw that really consistently across the regions, except for the shift that we saw in Europe. But the adoption speed of 12c was quite strong in the quarter as it was in Q3.\n\n---\n\nKash, let me give you a little kind of an interesting commentary. I think on the relationship between PaaS and database adoption on-premise. We're the only company that says, \"Hey, you should -- what you run in the cloud and what you run on-premise should be compatible, so that you can push a button and move a workload from your private cloud to the Oracle public cloud and back again. Or you can do development test in the public cloud and do a production in your private cloud on-premise if you want to.\" So that has -- we think, over time, that's going to dramatically accelerate the adoption of features -- certain features of our database on-premise because they're getting those features in the cloud. They're getting multi-tenancy in the cloud. They're getting the in-memory database features in the cloud. And they'll want to have an exact analog in their private cloud on-premise. So I think that's going to actually help keeping our customers current with the latest features of the database.\n\n---\n\nWonderful. Safra, any commentary on the license growth for databases?\n\n---\n\nWell, I want to talk to you actually about the options that is best [ph]. As you would expect, everything around security, many of our customers are realizing the security options that we have, which are really very, very critical. Obviously, cyberhacks and all those things are -- and also inside threats are something they are finally really focused on. And so database security options for us vary significantly like around 30%, that kind of level. And many of our customers are looking now at the multi-tenant option, which is available with our newest product and that is doing very well. That means that our customers are moving even themselves into their own private cloud to manage more efficiently. So that was very, very good for us this year -- this quarter.\n\n---\n\nI guess we understand and appreciate the emphasis here on the cloud business, but I'd like to ask a question on what I guess is still the overwhelming majority of your revenue today. And that's what -- I'm talking about the on-premise software business. How should we be thinking about your enterprise customer base? What is their behavior like? And where do you think it's going to be moving forward from here? I mean, in the past, I think we've heard both Safra and Mark talk about the sustainability of the Siebel maintenance stream. I guess as enterprises move to the cloud, is this move largely -- as your customers -- and I know, Mark, you sort of addressed this a little bit. But are they -- are your customers largely replacing on-premise technology? Or is it primarily for new implementations today and into the future? I'm sorry for the long question, but I guess what I'm trying to get to is how should we think about the current support stream from that on-premise software, the current support and maintenance into the future?\n\n---\n\nGreat. So firstly, it's very important that you understand, our support base continues to grow. When we sell new licenses at all, any new license, that increases our base. We do continue to sell billions of dollars of new licenses. Our renewal rates, by the way, remain extremely high, very, very high, historically high rates. So many of our customers are not necessarily -- are not canceling support and moving everything to the cloud overnight. They are adding cloud capabilities. What happens invariably is even when they add something in the cloud that they did on-premise, they have other uses for many of our licenses that they've had before. We would like them, over time frankly, if we had our way, to move everything to the cloud. That would mean probably revenue rates of significantly larger than we are now. But our customers, our base, continues to grow. Our customer base continues to grow. And our support numbers continue to go up, up obviously 8% just this quarter.\n\n---\n\nYes, look, I think what Safra said is right, I think 8% CD growth for the quarter. Renewal rates were very strong, again, if you will, flat year-over-year, meaning they were very, very, very good. And again, I'll try to go through this again so it'll be clear. Most of the new things that we sold or most of what we sold in the cloud was incremental in terms of certainly SaaS applications. So I think again, the way to think through this is you're going to have a very large on-premise environment, I think, for a long period of time. But workloads are shifting to the cloud. And that is an opportunity for us as we maintain our on-prem base but frankly grow our market share through this shift to the cloud. And we can see it, and it's exciting. Remember, John, too, when we win a SaaS application, we gain all the hardware, all the operating systems, all the database and all the middleware. When we gain PaaS, we get all the database, all the operating system and all the hardware as well. So I think you're going to see on-prem, I think our position on-prem is actually strengthening on a relative basis to what's in the market. And we are now growing faster with these numbers, and I don't know how many ways to go through these numbers to show the market share we're gaining and the speed by which we're accelerating our market position in the cloud. And I think we got a chance to get both.\n\n---\n\nLet me just add -- briefly summarize what Mark said. Our support base, our installed base on-premise is going up 8% and will continue to go up, while our cloud business is experiencing hypergrowth, 50% of revenue growth, 50% revenue growth, maybe more than that.\n\n---\n\nSafra, in Q4, did you see a greater percentage of deals in the pipeline than maybe were forecasted to go as perpetual license that made the shift to a cloud model and, therefore, that was the weight on the license? I think, really, to the -- what we all were looking for, there was a big delta there. And just curious if you have any commentary. And then maybe for Mark, as it relates to some of the cloud initial deal sizes and duration of these contracts, if you could maybe point at what you're seeing in terms of some of the contract values that you're seeing throughout the year and any change in characteristics there, that would be helpful.\n\n---\n\nNo, that isn't how it works. It's not that -- by the time a deal itself is actually listed in the forecast, it's already qualified as to what it's going to be. What -- the reality is that conversion rates move in the cloud were very, very, very high. And they were, to some extent, it took -- were the big focus. That is what we push in the forecast call every week. That's what we're talking about all the time, and that's what was very clear. In the forecast overall, there are many, many different shape deals and types of deals. And what exactly will close in the quarter, I never know. I have to use my own conversion and closing historical rates. This quarter showed a marked move towards converting the cloud deals. Those did very well. They far exceeded where we thought they would go. So that's how it worked out. Obviously, it doesn't show up in the revenues because we don't book them upfront like licenses.\n\n---\n\nTo your second question, productivity and ASP, your point about pricing both inclined. So our productivity per rep and our average deal size in cloud went up in the quarter. It went up a bit sequentially as well as it went up year-over-year. There is an important other dynamic that when you look at our cloud business, you've got several factors going on, Brent. You've got, one, frankly, the products are just better. They're just getting better and they're more mature. Our salespeople, we have more of them, and they have longer tenure. They're also simply better trained than they were just even a year or 2 years ago. And so the combination of this is what's driven the performance in the cloud. And make no mistake about it, there is a keen sales focus on growing our cloud business. Our cloud business is important for all the reasons that we've already talked through. Now one other point that we haven't brought up but I think I'd add to it is when you look at where we're heading with the cloud, we're going into a year now where we now get, frankly, more of our portfolio available in the cloud. So we've done just what we described in Q4, which are these numbers that everybody's all excited about, frankly, with not our entire product line available to us in the cloud and not even all of the products that we have localized to all of our geographies. So you have a set of factors occurring next fiscal year -- this coming -- the year we're in, wherein now we have yet more salespeople with more tenure, with more references, with now more of our products in line -- online, if you will, in more geographies.\n\n---\n\nTwo quick ones. First, Safra, as I look at sales and marketing, they came in a little bit higher than we had expected. Can you talk a little bit about the dynamics here? Are you actually paying out more on cloud provisions, et cetera? Or is it just that Q4 actually was very successful and we can't see it in revenue because it was over cloud? And then to Larry, a question on PaaS. What are the use cases that you're seeing on PaaS? Is it all test of development or are people actually putting software [ph] production workloads over on to your cloud already?\n\n---\n\nSo what you're seeing in the sales and marketing percentage is that, again, since we're not recognizing the revenue upfront like with license, though we have commissions and things like that with cloud, there's also additional sales expenses that are recognized immediately, but they don't have the corresponding revenue like new license does. So you're just seeing timing differences more than anything else. And that's impacting a number of our ratios clearly.\n\n---\n\nIn PaaS, we have a number of things going on. Yes, your point about dev test is correct. There is a lot of dev test use cases for PaaS, but there's more going on in PaaS than just Database as a Service and just dev tests. We have released our first, really, BI solution into the market, which is now -- Visual Analyzer, which now goes head up against Tableau. And we had good success with that product in Q4. So again, our competitors are shifting now as opposed to in BI on-premise, where we would have competed with Cognos or BusinessObjects. We now compete with Tableau. And that's in our PaaS results that we've described. Also, Java as a Service was strong in the quarter. The collection of those services were 30%, 40% of our PaaS bookings. And yes, dev test. Other than that, dev test is certainly a very big use case for our customers.\n\n---\n\nI think we've hit a lot on the software side of the business in cloud, but we haven't really touched on hardware much. You guys came in, actually, a little bit above the midpoint of your constant currency guidance on hardware this quarter. Just wondering if you can comment on the trends you're seeing there, Engineered Systems versus the non-Engineered business. And Safra, I know you didn't give us specific guidance for the hardware business, but how are you guys thinking about that going forward?\n\n---\n\nEngineered Systems bookings grew double digits in the quarter. Very strong. We had over 15 -- I'm doing this off the top of my head, 1,500, 1,600 incremental systems in the quarter, so very strong in Engineered Systems side. We have very strong growth in North America, very good performance out of one of our Oracle Database appliance products. So SuperCluster was very strong in the quarter. We grew in storage in the quarter. And this is -- really, we're going through a shift in storage now. We released our SAN product, FS1, in the quarter, which saw some bookings. This is really the first quarter we got any bookings out of FS1. Our ZFS product, somebody's renamed that, but I have it certainly...\n\n---\n\nZS1.\n\n---\n\nZS1. I wish they wouldn't do that to me. But so they renamed it ZS1, that actually...\n\n---\n\nActually, it's ZS4. And they shouldn't rename it because it's hard to remember.\n\n---\n\nYes. So I missed the naming thing or we would -- but anyway, so we had good growth in that thing as well. So -- but -- and then we had sort of server performance that was -- declines in the quarter and then the growth in the other products that I've described netted to the growth rate that we described. I mean, let's face it, we are the only hardware company growing in the industry. So when you look at the market share numbers, they sort of get to be staggering. We've taken over the -- and this is not a question you asked, but I'm going to say it anyway, in the United States, when you look at servers above $15,000, the #1 company in market share now is Oracle. I believe that will occur region by region by region because of the strength of not just our hardware product line but the alignment of our software portfolio with it. So it was a good quarter for us in hardware, and I would expect that trend to continue. Very similar to John's question. I don't think we're telling you that there isn't an on-premise market. Please don't take that message from what we described. But I think the fact that you can take a workload from your on-premise data center and now move it seamlessly to the cloud and back and forth to a data center gives us a tremendous advantage. The configuration we have on cloud, the configuration we have on-premise now can be identical. The ability to move workloads back and forth, use that on our hardware in your data center, use that on the very same hardware, perhaps, in the cloud, we're the only company in the industry that can do this. And so I think this bodes very well for our hardware business, granted in a declining market, but I believe Oracle will gain market share in that declining market.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Phil. A telephonic replay of this call will be available for 24 hours. Dial-in information can be found in the press release issued earlier today. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call, and we look forward to speaking with you. Thank you for joining us today. And with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for closing.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Jason Maynard (Analysts)】\nLook, Oracle wasn't the first and won't be the last software company to go through this shift from selling upfront perpetual to ratable subscription licensing. And so the metrics that we were used to are obviously changing, and you guys gave a lot of color around the current quarter. And what I hope maybe we could do is drill down a little bit more on the longer-term impact of the model in customer lifetime value. And I know in your 10-year example, you generate more revenue with subscription. Can you guys talk a little bit about what you think the ballpark breakeven point is on a hypothetical deal, what happens to margins over this time and, ultimately, how this is going to impact cash flow?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Hurd (Executives)】\nI'll repeat what Safra said. Okay, let's take $1 million deal. If it's licensed over a 10-year period, you get the $1 million upfront for the license and you get 20% a year for 10 years. That's another $2 million for over a 10-year period, you get a total of $3 million. And after the cost of sales, it's a very profitable business. Most of that $3 million, again, after the cost of sales, is profit. In a $1 million SaaS or PaaS deal, you don't get anything upfront but you have to pay the commissions. And then you only get -- and that $1 million deal is worth $10 million or more than 3x as much as the license deal over a 10-year period, over triple the value. But the accounting is entirely different. The accounting, you take it ratably over that 10-year period, so you have to pay the commissions upfront and recognize the expenses upfront and you get 10 years. Okay, so what's the profitability on SaaS and PaaS? It's -- this is going to shock you, it's about the same as license and support. It's stunningly profitable. Infrastructure as a Service is very different. Again, I'm talking about SaaS and PaaS. Infrastructure as a Service, the margins aren't nearly so high, though we make money in the Infrastructure as a Service. But you can see what Amazon's profit margins are on Infrastructure as a Service, we think it can be a profitable business when you get scale. But SaaS and PaaS is very similar to license. So that $1 million, which turned into something less than $3 million in profit after you get to scale in license, turns into something less than $10 million in profits, say, $9 million in profit over the 10-year period of -- that you're providing the service. So it's a much better business for us in terms of revenue, margin -- the revenue goes way up, the profits go way up. And the margins are approximately the same.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Safra Catz (Executives)】\nI think we have a huge advantage, Jason, that some of our competitors don't have. We make most of the components for the cloud service ourselves.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Ellison (Executives)】\nYes. Again, Salesforce paid us a lot of money for their platform. They buy Exadata from us to run their data center. They buy the Oracle Database. They paid a lot of money for the Oracle Database. So -- by the way, we just signed an Oracle Database deal, so SAP could run Concur. We signed an Oracle Database deal, this is all in the last 12 months, so SAP can run Ariba. We signed an Oracle Database deal so SAP could run SuccessFactors. We get a really good deal on the Oracle Database, on Java Middleware, on Exadata and all of those things. So our expense profile is very, very different. By the way, it's interesting. SAP does not use HANA in the cloud very much. I know that because they keep paying us. Again this quarter, they pay us for Oracle for Concur, and Oracle for Ariba, and Oracle for SuccessFactors. If they're using HANA for anything, I don't know about it.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Hurd (Executives)】\nJason, just to add one thing that as you talked about the conversion from license to ratable, I gave the stat last quarter, but I'll give it again for this quarter. Last quarter, I think I said that 82% of our cloud SaaS deals were actually not Oracle customers of an application when they acquired or contracted for a SaaS application. This quarter, it was over 60%. So these are -- this is not just a conversion of Oracle customers -- Oracle application customers to SaaS. This is a lot of greenfield new market share for Oracle as well.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Ellison (Executives)】\nYes. I've got a follow-up to what Mark just said. So the SaaS market is much bigger than the license market. I think as Mark is saying, we can go much further down market, get the customers we could never get to before because the SaaS service is much easier to consume for a midsize company than buying a computer, opening a data center, hiring a bunch of people and running licensed software. So we think the available market is dramatically larger [ph].\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Hurd (Executives)】\nYes, the global mid-market is now available to us unlike it would have been in the traditional license model. And it's very exciting.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Turits (Analysts)】\nI wanted to drill down on the cloud numbers, especially how they stood up relative to license. The license missed in the quarter, that's consensus, by about $273 million. Obviously, that's very much due to that shift over to cloud in terms of accounting structure, in terms of structure? Is that all due to that? Or is there some impact, anything negative that we should read fundamentally from the license miss in either Database apps or Middleware?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Safra Catz (Executives)】\nOkay. So first of all, I didn't give guidance regarding license. So whatever number you put in your spreadsheet, we didn't make that number, okay?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Turits (Analysts)】\nNo, I just meant relative to consensus, that's all.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Safra Catz (Executives)】\nOkay. Relative to all of you who have a lot of spreadsheets. So -- however, the reality is, I think that you can see the most instruction from what happened in Europe. Our Europe new license was down a lot. Our Europe cloud was huge. So it was -- for them, they focused all in, they went all in on pushing cloud and that's where the focus went. Other than that, I think if we're going to talk about spreadsheets that I did not actually guide you to, in currency, I think you all missed the boat there, too, a bit. But that's okay. We got another quarter now and -- but the truth is that yes, our customers are focusing on cloud as are our sales force. We have a lot of references. And when a customer comes to us, to the extent that they are a good candidate for cloud, which they are, we are going to be talking about cloud, we are going to be selling cloud, and we would much rather have a cloud booking for -- as I said, for $1 million than we would for a class -- for a licensed deal, which I book all the way, right upfront, throw out to the bottom line, I would much rather have a cloud booking for $1 million than a new license dollar. And we are pushing that conversion quickly.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Hurd (Executives)】\nJust a little bit more. I mean, no region missed its CD forecast with the exception of Europe. So just to be clear, CD forecast at your -- when you're talking about dollars from a CD perspective, every region executed as we expected in license with the exception of Europe. Europe had phenomenal cloud quarter inclusive of probably one of the most exciting financials in the cloud deal we've seen at HSBC. So some very exciting transactions in Europe. And they definitely made the shift. But to whatever you have in your numbers on a local basis, no region missed its CD forecast and license with exception of Europe that had a material shift to the cloud in the quarter, including some pretty exciting deals like what I just described.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Heather Bellini (Analysts)】\nSafra, I know our spreadsheets are nowhere near as good as yours are. But just to follow up a little bit. Q4 used to be -- you'd always characterize it as Mardi Gras for Oracle from a license revenue perspective. And now that this transition seems to be happening so swiftly, it would seem -- in Q1, you would always have this big sequential dropoff. And I know you don't specifically talk about license revenue, but given we're all trying to get a hang of how to think about the company's seasonality going forward, should we think about Q4 -- the dynamic for Q4 seasonality is going to become a little bit more muted -- continue to become more muted as you have this success transitioning? But then again Q1, which used to be a quarter where license revenue used to have such a big sequential decline, maybe Q1 gets a little bit easier? Is there any way you can help us think about the seasonal changes?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Safra Catz (Executives)】\nYes, Heather, you have got it actually exactly nailed correctly. The reality is that cloud is growing sequentially generally, regardless. So Q1 in revenues, Q1 cloud is not going to be a giant dropoff from Q4. I know. My team here is telling me it's going up. I completely -- I just gave the guidance. So yes. So Heather, you have that right. So the seasonality for the whole company is muted. It is still true that our -- that from a bookings point of view and things like that, Q4 is Mardi Gras and it's still Mardi Gras. But revenue smooths out. New license, which was always just so, so enormous in Q4 it takes a giant dropoff, it becomes less and less important. So in total revenue, the seasonality smooths out a bit. And -- but of course, our new license numbers are still very big numbers. But in Q1, they're a much smaller percentage of the total than they are in Q4.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Hurd (Executives)】\nI do think it's worth noting, Heather, that in Q4 for us on a cloud bookings basis, we came in with a forecast that we had, which was what we talked about at the end of Q3 with the conference call. And every week, this forecast got better. Every week. There was not a single -- I gave an example of one deal but there is no gargantuan transaction in there. There is no dominant region. There is no dominant pillar. It is consistent by pillar, by geography. And it was a very consistent, steady move every week as we advanced through Q4.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kash Rangan (Analysts)】\nI'm not going to ask you a spreadsheet question, but I want to ask about databases. Any commentary on the new license sales of database directionally, how it trended? And also an update on 12c adoption, what percentage of the base is on 12c? And any quantification you can provide on the options, that will be good.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Hurd (Executives)】\n12c was good in the quarter. I think we gave you a comparison last quarter, but if we compared it to '11, we've been about 50% faster in feature adoptions of 12c than we were at '11, so it was very strong. And if you went by region, you saw a tremendous performance in database in North America, even in license. And you saw that really consistently across the regions, except for the shift that we saw in Europe. But the adoption speed of 12c was quite strong in the quarter as it was in Q3.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Ellison (Executives)】\nKash, let me give you a little kind of an interesting commentary. I think on the relationship between PaaS and database adoption on-premise. We're the only company that says, \"Hey, you should -- what you run in the cloud and what you run on-premise should be compatible, so that you can push a button and move a workload from your private cloud to the Oracle public cloud and back again. Or you can do development test in the public cloud and do a production in your private cloud on-premise if you want to.\" So that has -- we think, over time, that's going to dramatically accelerate the adoption of features -- certain features of our database on-premise because they're getting those features in the cloud. They're getting multi-tenancy in the cloud. They're getting the in-memory database features in the cloud. And they'll want to have an exact analog in their private cloud on-premise. So I think that's going to actually help keeping our customers current with the latest features of the database.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kash Rangan (Analysts)】\nWonderful. Safra, any commentary on the license growth for databases?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Safra Catz (Executives)】\nWell, I want to talk to you actually about the options that is best [ph]. As you would expect, everything around security, many of our customers are realizing the security options that we have, which are really very, very critical. Obviously, cyberhacks and all those things are -- and also inside threats are something they are finally really focused on. And so database security options for us vary significantly like around 30%, that kind of level. And many of our customers are looking now at the multi-tenant option, which is available with our newest product and that is doing very well. That means that our customers are moving even themselves into their own private cloud to manage more efficiently. So that was very, very good for us this year -- this quarter.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John DiFucci (Analysts)】\nI guess we understand and appreciate the emphasis here on the cloud business, but I'd like to ask a question on what I guess is still the overwhelming majority of your revenue today. And that's what -- I'm talking about the on-premise software business. How should we be thinking about your enterprise customer base? What is their behavior like? And where do you think it's going to be moving forward from here? I mean, in the past, I think we've heard both Safra and Mark talk about the sustainability of the Siebel maintenance stream. I guess as enterprises move to the cloud, is this move largely -- as your customers -- and I know, Mark, you sort of addressed this a little bit. But are they -- are your customers largely replacing on-premise technology? Or is it primarily for new implementations today and into the future? I'm sorry for the long question, but I guess what I'm trying to get to is how should we think about the current support stream from that on-premise software, the current support and maintenance into the future?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Safra Catz (Executives)】\nGreat. So firstly, it's very important that you understand, our support base continues to grow. When we sell new licenses at all, any new license, that increases our base. We do continue to sell billions of dollars of new licenses. Our renewal rates, by the way, remain extremely high, very, very high, historically high rates. So many of our customers are not necessarily -- are not canceling support and moving everything to the cloud overnight. They are adding cloud capabilities. What happens invariably is even when they add something in the cloud that they did on-premise, they have other uses for many of our licenses that they've had before. We would like them, over time frankly, if we had our way, to move everything to the cloud. That would mean probably revenue rates of significantly larger than we are now. But our customers, our base, continues to grow. Our customer base continues to grow. And our support numbers continue to go up, up obviously 8% just this quarter.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Hurd (Executives)】\nYes, look, I think what Safra said is right, I think 8% CD growth for the quarter. Renewal rates were very strong, again, if you will, flat year-over-year, meaning they were very, very, very good. And again, I'll try to go through this again so it'll be clear. Most of the new things that we sold or most of what we sold in the cloud was incremental in terms of certainly SaaS applications. So I think again, the way to think through this is you're going to have a very large on-premise environment, I think, for a long period of time. But workloads are shifting to the cloud. And that is an opportunity for us as we maintain our on-prem base but frankly grow our market share through this shift to the cloud. And we can see it, and it's exciting. Remember, John, too, when we win a SaaS application, we gain all the hardware, all the operating systems, all the database and all the middleware. When we gain PaaS, we get all the database, all the operating system and all the hardware as well. So I think you're going to see on-prem, I think our position on-prem is actually strengthening on a relative basis to what's in the market. And we are now growing faster with these numbers, and I don't know how many ways to go through these numbers to show the market share we're gaining and the speed by which we're accelerating our market position in the cloud. And I think we got a chance to get both.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Ellison (Executives)】\nLet me just add -- briefly summarize what Mark said. Our support base, our installed base on-premise is going up 8% and will continue to go up, while our cloud business is experiencing hypergrowth, 50% of revenue growth, 50% revenue growth, maybe more than that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Brent Thill (Analysts)】\nSafra, in Q4, did you see a greater percentage of deals in the pipeline than maybe were forecasted to go as perpetual license that made the shift to a cloud model and, therefore, that was the weight on the license? I think, really, to the -- what we all were looking for, there was a big delta there. And just curious if you have any commentary. And then maybe for Mark, as it relates to some of the cloud initial deal sizes and duration of these contracts, if you could maybe point at what you're seeing in terms of some of the contract values that you're seeing throughout the year and any change in characteristics there, that would be helpful.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Safra Catz (Executives)】\nNo, that isn't how it works. It's not that -- by the time a deal itself is actually listed in the forecast, it's already qualified as to what it's going to be. What -- the reality is that conversion rates move in the cloud were very, very, very high. And they were, to some extent, it took -- were the big focus. That is what we push in the forecast call every week. That's what we're talking about all the time, and that's what was very clear. In the forecast overall, there are many, many different shape deals and types of deals. And what exactly will close in the quarter, I never know. I have to use my own conversion and closing historical rates. This quarter showed a marked move towards converting the cloud deals. Those did very well. They far exceeded where we thought they would go. So that's how it worked out. Obviously, it doesn't show up in the revenues because we don't book them upfront like licenses.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Hurd (Executives)】\nTo your second question, productivity and ASP, your point about pricing both inclined. So our productivity per rep and our average deal size in cloud went up in the quarter. It went up a bit sequentially as well as it went up year-over-year. There is an important other dynamic that when you look at our cloud business, you've got several factors going on, Brent. You've got, one, frankly, the products are just better. They're just getting better and they're more mature. Our salespeople, we have more of them, and they have longer tenure. They're also simply better trained than they were just even a year or 2 years ago. And so the combination of this is what's driven the performance in the cloud. And make no mistake about it, there is a keen sales focus on growing our cloud business. Our cloud business is important for all the reasons that we've already talked through. Now one other point that we haven't brought up but I think I'd add to it is when you look at where we're heading with the cloud, we're going into a year now where we now get, frankly, more of our portfolio available in the cloud. So we've done just what we described in Q4, which are these numbers that everybody's all excited about, frankly, with not our entire product line available to us in the cloud and not even all of the products that we have localized to all of our geographies. So you have a set of factors occurring next fiscal year -- this coming -- the year we're in, wherein now we have yet more salespeople with more tenure, with more references, with now more of our products in line -- online, if you will, in more geographies.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Raimo Lenschow (Analysts)】\nTwo quick ones. First, Safra, as I look at sales and marketing, they came in a little bit higher than we had expected. Can you talk a little bit about the dynamics here? Are you actually paying out more on cloud provisions, et cetera? Or is it just that Q4 actually was very successful and we can't see it in revenue because it was over cloud? And then to Larry, a question on PaaS. What are the use cases that you're seeing on PaaS? Is it all test of development or are people actually putting software [ph] production workloads over on to your cloud already?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Safra Catz (Executives)】\nSo what you're seeing in the sales and marketing percentage is that, again, since we're not recognizing the revenue upfront like with license, though we have commissions and things like that with cloud, there's also additional sales expenses that are recognized immediately, but they don't have the corresponding revenue like new license does. So you're just seeing timing differences more than anything else. And that's impacting a number of our ratios clearly.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Ellison (Executives)】\nIn PaaS, we have a number of things going on. Yes, your point about dev test is correct. There is a lot of dev test use cases for PaaS, but there's more going on in PaaS than just Database as a Service and just dev tests. We have released our first, really, BI solution into the market, which is now -- Visual Analyzer, which now goes head up against Tableau. And we had good success with that product in Q4. So again, our competitors are shifting now as opposed to in BI on-premise, where we would have competed with Cognos or BusinessObjects. We now compete with Tableau. And that's in our PaaS results that we've described. Also, Java as a Service was strong in the quarter. The collection of those services were 30%, 40% of our PaaS bookings. And yes, dev test. Other than that, dev test is certainly a very big use case for our customers.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Philip Winslow (Analysts)】\nI think we've hit a lot on the software side of the business in cloud, but we haven't really touched on hardware much. You guys came in, actually, a little bit above the midpoint of your constant currency guidance on hardware this quarter. Just wondering if you can comment on the trends you're seeing there, Engineered Systems versus the non-Engineered business. And Safra, I know you didn't give us specific guidance for the hardware business, but how are you guys thinking about that going forward?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Hurd (Executives)】\nEngineered Systems bookings grew double digits in the quarter. Very strong. We had over 15 -- I'm doing this off the top of my head, 1,500, 1,600 incremental systems in the quarter, so very strong in Engineered Systems side. We have very strong growth in North America, very good performance out of one of our Oracle Database appliance products. So SuperCluster was very strong in the quarter. We grew in storage in the quarter. And this is -- really, we're going through a shift in storage now. We released our SAN product, FS1, in the quarter, which saw some bookings. This is really the first quarter we got any bookings out of FS1. Our ZFS product, somebody's renamed that, but I have it certainly...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Ellison (Executives)】\nZS1.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Hurd (Executives)】\nZS1. I wish they wouldn't do that to me. But so they renamed it ZS1, that actually...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Ellison (Executives)】\nActually, it's ZS4. And they shouldn't rename it because it's hard to remember.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Hurd (Executives)】\nYes. So I missed the naming thing or we would -- but anyway, so we had good growth in that thing as well. So -- but -- and then we had sort of server performance that was -- declines in the quarter and then the growth in the other products that I've described netted to the growth rate that we described. I mean, let's face it, we are the only hardware company growing in the industry. So when you look at the market share numbers, they sort of get to be staggering. We've taken over the -- and this is not a question you asked, but I'm going to say it anyway, in the United States, when you look at servers above $15,000, the #1 company in market share now is Oracle. I believe that will occur region by region by region because of the strength of not just our hardware product line but the alignment of our software portfolio with it. So it was a good quarter for us in hardware, and I would expect that trend to continue. Very similar to John's question. I don't think we're telling you that there isn't an on-premise market. Please don't take that message from what we described. But I think the fact that you can take a workload from your on-premise data center and now move it seamlessly to the cloud and back and forth to a data center gives us a tremendous advantage. The configuration we have on cloud, the configuration we have on-premise now can be identical. The ability to move workloads back and forth, use that on our hardware in your data center, use that on the very same hardware, perhaps, in the cloud, we're the only company in the industry that can do this. And so I think this bodes very well for our hardware business, granted in a declining market, but I believe Oracle will gain market share in that declining market.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ken Bond (Executives)】\nThank you, Phil.

These risks and uncertainties are described in our press release, in Item 1A of our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and other documents we file or furnish to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Also, we will be using a non-GAAP financial measure. The definition of the non-GAAP financial measure along with the reconciliations to the related GAAP measure are described in our press release. Also included in our slides are the non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted EBITDA gross profit and adjusted EBITDA SG&A and the reconciliations of these measures to their respective GAAP financial measure. \r\nWith these remarks, I'd now like to turn it over to John.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Matt, and thank you, all, for joining us to review our first quarter results for fiscal 2016. We are pleased with our results for the quarter, and they reflect our continued progress in driving growth as we also make significant investments to accelerate our transformation into a retail health care company. \r\nWe increased same-store sales by 2.9% over the prior year period, which was driven by a 1.6% increase in same-store prescription count. While we are beginning to cycle growth that occurred in states that expanded Medicaid coverage in 2014, we continued to benefit from this trend in the quarter. \r\nAdjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $299.3 million, an increase of $16.7 million compared to the prior year. This growth resulted from an improvement in front-end and pharmacy gross profit, including the benefit of savings we generated through our drug purchasing arrangement with McKesson. It's important to note that adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was impacted by increased expenses related to strategic investments in key growth initiatives like adding RediClinics to Rite Aid stores and the launch of wellness+ with Plenti. \r\nNet income was $18.8 million or $0.02 per diluted share compared to last year's first quarter net income of $41.4 million or $0.04 per diluted share. The decline in net income resulted primarily from interest and other incremental pretax costs of $36 million or $0.02 per share on an after-tax basis incurred in connection with the company's pending acquisition of EnvisionRx. These incremental costs were partially offset by an increase in adjusted EBITDA. \r\nIn terms of the acquisition of EnvisionRx, I'm pleased to report that we are making tremendous progress in gaining the required regulatory approvals and meeting the customary closing conditions that are needed to close the deal. Thanks to the hard work of the Rite Aid and EnvisionRx teams, we expect to complete acquisition by the beginning of July. The closing will mark an important and exciting milestone in our journey to become a growing retail health care company. \r\nBy combining EnvisionRx's PBM and pharmacy-related businesses with Rite Aid's retail platform and health services, we can create an integrated health care offering that delivers additional value and choice for plan sponsors, EnvisionRx patients and Rite Aid customers. From Rite Aid's perspective, the acquisition gives us a strong presence in some of health care's fastest-growing segments, including specialty pharmacy and the Medicare Part D insurance market. \r\nLong term, this acquisition provides Rite Aid with a significant opportunity to drive additional traffic to our stores, integrate specialty pharmacy into parts of our retail network and generate cost synergies that help deliver additional value for Rite Aid customers. Simply put, this acquisition will significantly expand our health and wellness platform and put us in a better position to compete in the evolving health care marketplace. \r\nBecoming part of the Rite Aid team will also allow EnvisionRx to offer a more competitive value proposition. We are particularly excited about the opportunity to leverage Rite Aid health services like RediClinic, Rite Aid Health Alliance and coaching from Health Dialog to give clients additional tools to manage health care costs and drive positive health outcomes. We look forward to the completion of this acquisition so that we can begin creating the integrated health care platform that we have in mind. We hope to announce that news very soon. \r\nAt this time, I'd like to turn it over to our President and Chief Operating Officer, Ken Martindale, who has additional information regarding our key initiatives. Ken?\n\n---\n\nThanks, John, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on today's call. We continue to make outstanding progress with our key initiatives, which have been the driving force behind our efforts to provide a differentiated shopping experience for our customers and deliver a higher level of care to the communities that we serve. \r\nPerhaps the biggest news of the quarter was our successful launch of wellness+ with Plenti, which is part of the first coalition loyalty program in the United States. This enhancement to wellness+ allows our members to continue earning all of the terrific benefits that they've grown accustomed to over the past 5 years. In addition, customers can now earn Plenti points in lieu of +UPs that can be redeemed for savings at Rite Aid and other Plenti partners. They can also redeem Plenti points that are earned at partner locations at their favorite Rite Aid store. \r\nOur store teams have done an excellent job of engaging our customers and explaining the tremendous value offered by this groundbreaking program. To date, Rite Aid has enrolled more than 10 million customers, and our Plenti partners have enrolled millions more throughout the coalition. Last week at Rite Aid, our Plenti members accounted for 2/3 of the transactions that were tied to a loyalty card. It's worth noting that we have also had significant success in engaging our Gold and Silver members, our most valuable and loyal customers in this enhanced loyalty offering. \r\nWe also launched an integrated marketing campaign to support the introduction of wellness+ with Plenti. We are leveraging cable television, network radio, traditional print and a multi-platform digital strategy. Other Plenti partners are also supporting the program with aggressive marketing campaigns, and we're excited about this opportunity to reach new customers. We are pleased with the initial positive customer response to wellness+ with Plenti and look forward to building upon our early success. \r\nOur Genuine Well-being remodel program continues to produce strong results as we convert additional stores to this unique and engaging format. These stores include enhanced design, innovative merchandising concepts, expanded wellness product and service offerings and a higher level of service through our more than 2,000 Wellness Ambassadors. \r\nBy the end of the quarter, we had a grand total of 1,741 wellness stores, which represents 38% of our chain. These stores continue to outperform the rest of the chain in terms of same-store front-end sales and script count. Our plan for the fiscal year is to remodel a total of 400 stores to the Wellness format as part of a broader real estate strategy that also includes 33 store relocations and 11 net new stores. \r\nAlso during the quarter, we introduced Rite Aid RediClinics to Seattle, our third market, and announced a joint venture with MultiCare Health System to support these locations. We currently have 30 Rite Aid RediClinics operating throughout the greater Seattle, Philadelphia and Baltimore-D.C. areas. We plan to open a total of 50 clinics throughout fiscal 2016, including additional locations in Texas, where RediClinic is already a leading provider of convenient care clinic services. This would bring our total number of operating clinics to over 100. \r\nOur highly successful immunization program continues to be a point of emphasis as our teams again prepare for another upcoming flu season by engaging with community organizations and businesses for potential flu shot clinics. We're also promoting our full offering of immunizations and leveraging our new Vaccine Central tool to raise awareness about the importance of vaccinations. In addition, we continue to be a convenient immunization destination for communities dealing with situations like the recent outbreak of pertussis in Washington state. \r\nAs part of our efforts to make our pharmacy experience more convenient, we successfully launched our new, OneTripRefills program during the quarter. Our patients can now sign up to receive all of their monthly maintenance medications by making a single trip to the pharmacy. The program has been well received by our patients. And when combined with our existing service to send alerts via text message, email or phone when a prescription is ready to be picked up, it creates a more patient-friendly experience for our Rite Aid customers. \r\nWe continue to make important strategic investments to drive both short- and long-term growth, and one of our most successful efforts has been our prescription file buy program. In the first quarter, we completed $14.3 million in file buys, which continue to make positive contributions to our script count. We have allocated $100 million for file buys in fiscal 2016 and have the flexibility to increase that allocation based on market conditions. \r\nOur portfolio of Rite Aid brands continues to generate positive results with private brand penetration increasing to 18.2% for the quarter. Customer demand for private brand items continues to be high, and we remain focused on our opportunity to meet this demand by creating a world-class private brand. \r\nAnd finally, a quick note about the Rite Aid Foundation's KidCents program. KidCents allows our wellness+ members to round up their purchases to the nearest dollar and donate the change to a charity of their choice. The program has been tremendously popular with both our associates and our customers. During the quarter, we were honored to join forces with an outstanding nonprofit organization, Folds of Honor, which provides educational scholarships to families of fallen or disabled veterans. Through KidCents over the recent Memorial Day holiday, we announced a $1.3 million donation to support this important and worthy cause. \r\nTo sum it up, our key initiatives continue to drive positive business results while positioning Rite Aid to be the customers' #1 choice for health and wellness. We look forward to working as a team to advance these important programs and find new ways to differentiate Rite Aid from other retailers. \r\nAt this time, I'll turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Darren Karst, who will provide additional details about our financial results. Darren?\n\n---\n\nThanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter results reflect continued strong script count and front-end trends, improvements in gross margin over the prior year, continued progress on our business initiatives and good cost control, which more than offset our investments in clinic expansion and the launch of Plenti. \r\nOn the call this morning, I'll walk through our first quarter financial results, discuss our liquidity, certain balance sheet items, our capital expenditure program and, finally, review our fiscal 2016 guidance. \r\nRevenue for the quarter was $6.6 billion, which was $182 million or 2.8% higher than last year's first quarter. The increase was due to higher front-end and pharmacy sales as well as incremental revenue contributed from RediClinic and Health Dialog. \r\nOverall, same-store sales increased 2.9% in the quarter. Front-end same-store sales increased by 0.6% due to higher levels of cough, cold and flu incidents and good performance in core drugstore categories. \r\nPharmacy same-store sales were higher by 3.9%, which included a negative impact of approximately 165 basis points from new generic drugs. Pharmacy same-store script count was up 1.6%, reflecting higher utilization in Medicaid expansion states and an increase in flu incidents. We are now cycling last year's strong Medicaid expansion benefit, so our expectation is that script-comp growth comparisons will become more difficult for the next several months. \r\nAdjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $299.3 million or 4.5% of revenues, which was $16.7 million greater than the prior year's first quarter of $282.6 million or 4.4% of revenues. The current quarter's results were primarily driven by improved sales and gross margin, offset in part by higher SG&A. \r\nNet income for the quarter was $18.8 million or $0.02 per diluted share compared to net income of $41.4 million or $0.04 per diluted share in the prior year's first quarter. \r\nInterest expense was $22.8 million higher than the prior year's quarter due to $18.6 million of interest expense on our recently issued 6 1/8% unsecured notes and $15.4 million of expense for bridge commitment fees. Both of these items are related to the pending Envision acquisition. Together, these 2 items represented an after-tax drag on earnings of approximately $0.02 per diluted share. \r\nNet income for the quarter was also negatively impacted by increases in depreciation and amortization due to our increases in capital expenditure spending over the last year and LIFO charges due to lower projected deflation on generic drugs versus last year. \r\nTotal gross profit dollars in the quarter were $56.6 million better than last year's first quarter and 8 basis points better as a percent of revenues. \r\nAdjusted EBITDA gross profit, which excludes specific items, was favorable to the prior year first quarter by $59 million and 12 basis points favorable as a percent of revenues. Pharmacy gross profit dollars were favorable to the prior year due to increased sales, but margin rate was worse than the prior year due to reimbursement rate pressure, which was partially offset by purchasing efficiencies resulting from our arrangement with McKesson. Front-end gross profit dollars and rate were favorable to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA gross profit was also favorably impacted by lower distribution costs as well as additional revenues from Health Dialog and RediClinic. \r\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter were higher by $55.2 million and 14 basis points compared to last year. Adjusted EBITDA SG&A dollars, which excludes specific items, were higher by $42.3 million but 2 basis points lower as a percent of revenues compared to last year as we were able to leverage the increase in sales through our various expense control initiatives. The increase in dollars was driven by increases in advertising and training costs of approximately $7.5 million related to the rollout of Plenti, incremental operating investments of approximately $4.5 million related to the rollout of additional in-store clinics and payroll and benefit costs related to our higher sales volume. \r\nOur cash flow statement for the quarter shows a net source of cash from operating activities of $368 million as compared to $240 million in last year's first quarter with working capital timing differences driving most of the difference. \r\nNet cash used in investing activities for the quarter was $152 million versus $177 million last year. Note that last year's expenditures included $65 million for the purchase of Health Dialog and RediClinic. \r\nDuring the first quarter, we remodeled 108 stores, expanded 1 store, relocated 2 stores and closed 4 stores. At the end of the quarter, we had completed and grand-reopened 1,741 wellness stores. For the first quarter, front-end same-store sales in our wellness stores that have been remodeled in the past 24 months were approximately 332 basis points higher than our non-wellness stores, and script growth in these stores was 195 basis points higher. \r\nNow let's discuss liquidity. At the end of the first quarter, we had approximately $1.4 billion of liquidity, which is an improvement of $143 million from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. We had $1.6 billion in borrowings outstanding under our $3 billion revolving credit facility and $69 million of outstanding letters of credit. We have the ability to increase the availability under the revolving credit facility to $3.7 billion if we use the proceeds to repay our 8% First Lien Notes, which we expect to do when become callable in August 2015. We expect this refinancing of the 8% notes to provide an additional $30 million in annual interest expense savings. \r\nIn April 2015, we completed the issuance of $1.8 billion of guaranteed unsecured notes. The notes mature in April 2023 and have a rate of 6 1/8%. Proceeds of these notes, which are $1.77 billion net of bond issuance fees, are being held as invested cash to fund the cash portion of the Envision transaction. In May 2015, in accordance with the terms of our 8% convertible notes, the remaining $64 million that was outstanding under those notes were converted into 24.8 million shares of common stock. \r\nTotal debt net of invested cash was lower by $237 million from last year's first quarter. Our leverage ratio, defined as total debt less invested cash over LTM adjusted EBITDA, improved to 4.08x versus 4.52x as of the end of the prior year's first quarter. We expect our leverage ratio pro forma for a full year of Envision's results to increase to 5.2x upon the closing of the transaction. \r\nNow let's turn to our fiscal 2016 guidance. Our guidance reflects our expectations for continued reimbursement rate pressure and the benefits from the McKesson purchasing agreement as well as the anticipated benefits of our Wellness remodel program and other initiatives to grow sales and drive operational efficiencies. We've updated our guidance to include the results of Envision, assuming that the transaction closes at the beginning of July 2015. We expect script growth to benefit from the Affordable Care Act, favorable demographics, file buy acquisitions, growth in immunizations and other initiatives. \r\nWe expect total revenues, which include PBM revenues, to be between $30.7 billion and $31.2 billion. \r\nWe expect total drugstore sales to be between $26.9 billion and $27.4 billion and adjusted EBITDA to be between $1.35 billion and $1.45 billion for fiscal 2016. The EBITDA guidance increase is related to the inclusion of the operating results of Envision from July 2015 through the end of our fiscal year. \r\nSame-store sales are expected to be in a range from an increase of 2.5% to 4.5%, including the anticipated negative pharmacy sales impact of approximately 350 basis points from new generic introductions and continued reimbursement rate pressure. \r\nWe expect a range of net income of $150 million to $230 million and earnings per diluted share to be in a range of $0.14 to $0.22. Our net income and EPS guidance is net of estimated income tax expense of between $97 million and $151 million. However, we still expect our annual cash income taxes to be in a range of $10 million to $20 million as we continue to be able to utilize our $3.1 billion federal tax net operating loss carryforward to offset taxes that are currently payable.\r\nOur net income and EPS guidance also reflects the negative after-tax drag on earnings of approximately $32 million of pre-closing interest expense and acquisition costs related to the Envision acquisition and approximately $20 million of debt modification costs related to the refinancing of our 8% notes. Together, these nonrecurring items represent an after-tax expense of $0.05 per diluted share. \r\nThe range of guidance is primarily driven by our same-store sales range and pharmacy margin expectations. I also want to remind you that in last year's second quarter, our gross profit and EBITDA was favorably impacted by approximately $40 million resulting from the effect on inventory valuation related to our transition to McKesson last year. So that onetime item represents a headwind for our second quarter this year. \r\nIn terms of quarterly cadence, we generally expect the latter portion of the year to be stronger than the earlier portion. \r\nOur fiscal 2016 capital expenditure plan is to spend approximately $665 million with approximately $105 million related to new and relocated stores, $225 million related to Wellness remodels and approximately $100 million for script file buys. We're planning to open 11 new stores, complete 33 relocations and remodel 400 wellness stores in fiscal 2016. Our capital expenditure assumptions also includes a CapEx spend of $15 million related to Envision. \r\nWe expect free cash flow to be in a range of $300 million to $400 million for the year, including the benefit of lower pharmacy inventory. \r\nWe expect to close a total of 40 stores, of which the guidance includes a store lease closing provision for 10 stores with the balance of the stores closing upon lease expiration. \r\nThis completes my portion of the presentation. And now I'd like to turn it back to John. John?\n\n---\n\nThank you, Darren. Before we open the phone line for questions, I'd like to thank our Rite Aid team for the excellent work they did during the first quarter. Looking forward, we are excited to continue positioning Rite Aid for long-term growth through our journey to become a retail health care company. We believe these efforts will help us not only better serve our customers but also deliver long-term value for our shareholders. \r\nThat concludes our prepared remarks this morning. We'll now open the phone lines for questions.",

Together, these 2 items represented an after-tax drag on earnings of approximately $0.02 per diluted share. \r\nNet income for the quarter was also negatively impacted by increases in depreciation and amortization due to our increases in capital expenditure spending over the last year and LIFO charges due to lower projected deflation on generic drugs versus last year. \r\nTotal gross profit dollars in the quarter were $56.6 million better than last year's first quarter and 8 basis points better as a percent of revenues. \r\nAdjusted EBITDA gross profit, which excludes specific items, was favorable to the prior year first quarter by $59 million and 12 basis points favorable as a percent of revenues. Pharmacy gross profit dollars were favorable to the prior year due to increased sales, but margin rate was worse than the prior year due to reimbursement rate pressure, which was partially offset by purchasing efficiencies resulting from our arrangement with McKesson. Front-end gross profit dollars and rate were favorable to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA gross profit was also favorably impacted by lower distribution costs as well as additional revenues from Health Dialog and RediClinic. \r\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter were higher by $55.2 million and 14 basis points compared to last year. Adjusted EBITDA SG&A dollars, which excludes specific items, were higher by $42.3 million but 2 basis points lower as a percent of revenues compared to last year as we were able to leverage the increase in sales through our various expense control initiatives. The increase in dollars was driven by increases in advertising and training costs of approximately $7.5 million related to the rollout of Plenti, incremental operating investments of approximately $4.5 million related to the rollout of additional in-store clinics and payroll and benefit costs related to our higher sales volume. \r\nOur cash flow statement for the quarter shows a net source of cash from operating activities of $368 million as compared to $240 million in last year's first quarter with working capital timing differences driving most of the difference. \r\nNet cash used in investing activities for the quarter was $152 million versus $177 million last year. Note that last year's expenditures included $65 million for the purchase of Health Dialog and RediClinic. \r\nDuring the first quarter, we remodeled 108 stores, expanded 1 store, relocated 2 stores and closed 4 stores. At the end of the quarter, we had completed and grand-reopened 1,741 wellness stores. For the first quarter, front-end same-store sales in our wellness stores that have been remodeled in the past 24 months were approximately 332 basis points higher than our non-wellness stores, and script growth in these stores was 195 basis points higher. \r\nNow let's discuss liquidity. At the end of the first quarter, we had approximately $1.4 billion of liquidity, which is an improvement of $143 million from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. We had $1.6 billion in borrowings outstanding under our $3 billion revolving credit facility and $69 million of outstanding letters of credit. We have the ability to increase the availability under the revolving credit facility to $3.7 billion if we use the proceeds to repay our 8% First Lien Notes, which we expect to do when become callable in August 2015. We expect this refinancing of the 8% notes to provide an additional $30 million in annual interest expense savings. \r\nIn April 2015, we completed the issuance of $1.8 billion of guaranteed unsecured notes. The notes mature in April 2023 and have a rate of 6 1/8%. Proceeds of these notes, which are $1.77 billion net of bond issuance fees, are being held as invested cash to fund the cash portion of the Envision transaction. In May 2015, in accordance with the terms of our 8% convertible notes, the remaining $64 million that was outstanding under those notes were converted into 24.8 million shares of common stock. \r\nTotal debt net of invested cash was lower by $237 million from last year's first quarter. Our leverage ratio, defined as total debt less invested cash over LTM adjusted EBITDA, improved to 4.08x versus 4.52x as of the end of the prior year's first quarter. We expect our leverage ratio pro forma for a full year of Envision's results to increase to 5.2x upon the closing of the transaction. \r\nNow let's turn to our fiscal 2016 guidance. Our guidance reflects our expectations for continued reimbursement rate pressure and the benefits from the McKesson purchasing agreement as well as the anticipated benefits of our Wellness remodel program and other initiatives to grow sales and drive operational efficiencies. We've updated our guidance to include the results of Envision, assuming that the transaction closes at the beginning of July 2015. We expect script growth to benefit from the Affordable Care Act, favorable demographics, file buy acquisitions, growth in immunizations and other initiatives. \r\nWe expect total revenues, which include PBM revenues, to be between $30.7 billion and $31.2 billion. \r\nWe expect total drugstore sales to be between $26.9 billion and $27.4 billion and adjusted EBITDA to be between $1.35 billion and $1.45 billion for fiscal 2016. The EBITDA guidance increase is related to the inclusion of the operating results of Envision from July 2015 through the end of our fiscal year. \r\nSame-store sales are expected to be in a range from an increase of 2.5% to 4.5%, including the anticipated negative pharmacy sales impact of approximately 350 basis points from new generic introductions and continued reimbursement rate pressure. \r\nWe expect a range of net income of $150 million to $230 million and earnings per diluted share to be in a range of $0.14 to $0.22. Our net income and EPS guidance is net of estimated income tax expense of between $97 million and $151 million. However, we still expect our annual cash income taxes to be in a range of $10 million to $20 million as we continue to be able to utilize our $3.1 billion federal tax net operating loss carryforward to offset taxes that are currently payable.\r\nOur net income and EPS guidance also reflects the negative after-tax drag on earnings of approximately $32 million of pre-closing interest expense and acquisition costs related to the Envision acquisition and approximately $20 million of debt modification costs related to the refinancing of our 8% notes. Together, these nonrecurring items represent an after-tax expense of $0.05 per diluted share. \r\nThe range of guidance is primarily driven by our same-store sales range and pharmacy margin expectations. I also want to remind you that in last year's second quarter, our gross profit and EBITDA was favorably impacted by approximately $40 million resulting from the effect on inventory valuation related to our transition to McKesson last year. So that onetime item represents a headwind for our second quarter this year. \r\nIn terms of quarterly cadence, we generally expect the latter portion of the year to be stronger than the earlier portion. \r\nOur fiscal 2016 capital expenditure plan is to spend approximately $665 million with approximately $105 million related to new and relocated stores, $225 million related to Wellness remodels and approximately $100 million for script file buys. We're planning to open 11 new stores, complete 33 relocations and remodel 400 wellness stores in fiscal 2016. Our capital expenditure assumptions also includes a CapEx spend of $15 million related to Envision. \r\nWe expect free cash flow to be in a range of $300 million to $400 million for the year, including the benefit of lower pharmacy inventory. \r\nWe expect to close a total of 40 stores, of which the guidance includes a store lease closing provision for 10 stores with the balance of the stores closing upon lease expiration. \r\nThis completes my portion of the presentation. And now I'd like to turn it back to John. John?\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: John Standley (Executives)】\nThank you, Darren. Before we open the phone line for questions, I'd like to thank our Rite Aid team for the excellent work they did during the first quarter. Looking forward, we are excited to continue positioning Rite Aid for long-term growth through our journey to become a retail health care company. We believe these efforts will help us not only better serve our customers but also deliver long-term value for our shareholders. \r\nThat concludes our prepared remarks this morning. We'll now open the phone lines for questions.",
      "transcript_text3": "I guess just 2 quick ones on guidance. John, it seems like the raise is entirely from Envision. In light of the strong fundamental performance in the first quarter, just curious, any reason -- why not to think a little bit more positively fundamentally for the balance of the year? And then, Darren, just one quick point of clarification. The $100 million for Envision included -- does it include acquisition-related costs? And how does that compare to the original expectation or the $150 million to $160 million of EBITDA?\n\n---\n\nSo I'll go first, I guess. In terms of guidance for the core Rite Aid business, yes, I think we had a very good first quarter, very much in line, I guess, with our expectations. We have a couple of tough quarterly comparisons coming up, the second quarter in particular, so -- I think, as Darren kind of talked about the cadence. So I think guidance for the year still seems appropriate to us.\n\n---\n\nYes, and on the second question, the $100 million does not include any acquisition costs. Those are below the EBITDA line. And the $100 million is basically right on target with what our original expectation was on an annualized basis.\n\n---\n\nGot it. Now -- and then, John, if I could just sneak one more in -- strategic question. In light of the recent CVS-Target news, I was curious if you saw any similar opportunities out there in the marketplace, whether it be on the big-box side or maybe with even the grocery chain. Any other opportunities like that, that you guys see out there?\n\n---\n\nI can't point to a specific opportunity. I'll tell you we're -- again, as I think we've said all the way along, we're very open minded and those kinds of opportunities would be interesting to us. But I couldn't point to a specific one at the moment.\n\n---\n\nJohn, so first, the softness in comp scripts, I know it's largely or I think it's largely Medicaid related. But -- so is there anything you can do to try to spur some share? I guess it's not going to be demand, but share in the short term. And then is it -- do you think -- is it possible that comp scripts go negative before they reaccelerate? Or no, we're pretty close to a bottom here?\n\n---\n\nI think they might get a little softer before we're done because we're still kind of in the ramp-up phase. And when you look at the first quarter, although it probably decelerated a little bit as the quarter progressed, we still actually were net up in Medicaid scripts. So a lot of our pressure early on here has been actually on the commercial side of the business. And so as we continue -- as Darren said, as we continue to get to the period here over the next few months where the Medicaid continued to ramp, comps get a little tougher until we kind of cycle this thing, probably around August or so. So that's kind of, I think, the hand-to-hand combat we have in front of us from a script count perspective. But we're working on a lot of exciting stuff. We've got the remodels. We've got plenty out there right now that we're working very hard on. We're going to be out there with our flu shot campaign again this year, pushing very hard. So I think we've got some things to do to help us.\n\n---\n\nAnd then just on Plenti. So I know that was going to be a little bit disruptive in the short term, actually maybe seems to be a little less so than I would have thought. But where are we with that? And then at what point does this really start to become a customer acquisition vehicle, right, for people that are not wellness+ cardholders?\n\n---\n\nKen?\n\n---\n\nJohn, it's Ken. Where we are now, obviously, is pretty early. We're not even 2 months into this thing yet. But I think on -- the response from the consumer has been very positive. We're excited about the relationships that we're developing with some of these other brands. And so the -- out of the gates, I think it's pretty positive. You think back to when we launched wellness+, we built this whole thing around really our pharmacy business. And the great thing about Plenti is the way that we've structured this, we've retained all of the benefits that traditionally our customers have had with wellness+, but now they're really pushing the +UPs in the Plenti opportunity, gives them a lot more value and a lot more flexibility. So it's going to take a little while to ramp, and I think it's going to be much like what we saw with wellness+. It will be a gradual build. But I think we're pretty bullish on what we've seen so far.\n\n---\n\nI know you don't give quarterly guidance, but just given the outperformance in this quarter, and then, John, I heard you and Darren both talking about some of the headwinds in the back half, the $40 million last year that was beneficial from McKesson, can you maybe just help us understand, was -- one, this quarter, did it come in better than your expectations? Or did we all model it wrong? And secondly, as you look out to the back half of this year, are there things that are different than what we saw in the first quarter, setting aside the onetime benefit that you saw from McKesson last year?\n\n---\n\nI think -- I guess I have a couple of thoughts and I don't know if, Darren or Ken, you guys want to -- you want to jump in. I think, first of all, the first quarter, I think, was in line with our expectations. Darren has mentioned the $40 million. We have the reimbursement rate pressure that builds throughout the year, but we also have Abilify and Nexium, which we think are going to be [indiscernible] or sometime by the end of the year, and there is some value associated with those. So the way things kind of cycle and play out all the different factors through the numbers, I think that while not giving quarterly guidance, we do think the second quarter's a tougher one and we expect to see some strengthening as we go into the third and fourth quarter. So that's as close as I want to get to any kind of quarterly guidance.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And -- but John, as you think about your business, generally speaking, I mean, do you feel like there's anything that's changing either from a reimbursement perspective that you weren't anticipating or anything else that we need to be focused on? Because again, I thought that the -- whether that was your expectation or not in the first quarter, that was a really solid quarter. Here in the first quarter, and we understand what -- you talked a little bit about the headwind, but part of me has to believe that you're still being fairly conservative this year. Or am I wrong?\n\n---\n\nYou're -- our -- we feel good about our guidance.\n\n---\n\nAll right. And then -- so let me just ask a second question. And that's more on the PBM side of things. It looks like, as you said, you'll close Envision here at the beginning of July. Do you have any updated thoughts around how Envision has done, for example, in the selling season? Has -- have they benefited from the potential opportunity of what they can bring now that they're part of Rite Aid?\n\n---\n\nYes, so I think the answer is that Envision is performing in line with our expectations for the first part of their fiscal year. In terms of the selling season, their selling season honestly falls a little bit differently than you've -- you're seeing from the larger PBMs in that smaller clients generally wrap up their process a little bit later in the year. So we're still a little early in their selling season. I would, I guess, anecdotally tell you that they have seen more RFPs come in the door. Since we announced this transaction, I think there's more visibility to Envision. But I think it's a little early for us to tell you the selling season is good, bad or indifferent.\n\n---\n\nWell, just follow-up on the Plenti program here. I think, Ken, you might have made the comment that 2/3 -- you said something about 2/3 of transactions were from Plenti members. Was that -- is that mostly they were Wellness members that also are enrolled in Plenti?\n\n---\n\nYes, let me clarify it. Last week, we had 2/3 of the loyalty transactions that went through our store. We always have a number of kind of convenience-related non-member transactions that go through. And obviously, we don't have a lot of intelligence on those because those are just -- they're not tied to any card. But of all the cards that went through our front end and pharmacy last week, 2/3 of those transactions have been linked to a Plenti account. So that -- what that's telling you is that the population of wellness+ members that came in the door, 2/3 of them have already linked to a Plenti account. So we're moving them into the new program at a fairly good clip, and we're pretty happy with that rate.\n\n---\n\nCan you tell, of those 2/3, how many were not -- were just a Plenti member but not a Wellness member? In other words, getting to the earlier question, sort of a new customer acquisition from Plenti?\n\n---\n\nIt's still very early, like I said, but we are starting to see some customers coming in that were -- that signed up at our partners and we have not seen them before. So we are starting to see some new customers come in the door.\n\n---\n\nOkay, great. And then a clarification. Darren, in the guidance as well, I know we talked about some of the acquisition costs. Is the debt financing cost, the -- that's included -- that's in the guidance as well? You're absorbing it in the guidance?\n\n---\n\nIt is. You're talking about on the 8% notes, correct?\n\n---\n\nYes, yes.\n\n---\n\nIt is.\n\n---\n\nAs you spend more time thinking about Envision and maybe what it could do for you on the specialty front, how do you feel like Orchard could maybe sort of kind of get you deeper into that paradigm, which obviously has very good growth and would be a very strong add to the stores in terms of a specialty retail program? What thinking have you done around sort of different options for what that could bring you?\n\n---\n\nFirst of all, it brings us a -- 45 more limited distribution drugs that we didn't have before. So it -- we had a small portfolio of limited distribution drugs. This really gets us into the business, honestly. And so we've gone from nowhere to somewhere kind of overnight with this acquisition. So that's very exciting to us. I think our opportunity with Orchard is to broadly close it to the Rite Aid retail network. I think we have some work to do on the contracting side to kind of bring that to life. But that's a really big opportunity for us. Today, if someone walks into one of our stores, we don't have the drug, we're sending them somewhere else. So all of a sudden, here's 45 more drugs that we can now refer a patient to our own specialty pharmacy. Before we can do that, we need to make sure Orchard is fully contracted, which it is not today. So we have some leg work to do to get to that opportunity. But that is going to significantly expand our scope in terms of what we can do from a specialty perspective. Orchard continues to add additional drugs. They've had some success recently bringing some additional new drugs into their portfolio. And again, I think it's kind of like the whole Envision opportunity. Attaching the Rite Aid brand to it is really raising the awareness of all the things that Envision can do, and we think there's a good opportunity to just organically grow the Orchard specialty business. So we're really excited about it.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And not to belabor the point, but I've just gotten a lot of questions this morning on kind of the comp cadence. So we've obviously looked at the macro data, and it sort of is in line also a bit of what you guys are highlighting, at least on a near-term basis. As we think about sort of post-August, what's needed to kind of hit the annual guide, and you obviously gave a number of key drivers. If you had to sort of not put numbers around it but then maybe from like a qualitative perspective kind of give us a sense of where, of those various opportunities, you're likely to see the most uplift. How would you just kind of characterize the top 1 or 2 pieces that are going to drive that back to a more normalized level?\n\n---\n\nI'm excited about all the things we're working on. But I -- as it relates to our front-end business and probably indirectly to our pharmacy, I think Plenti is going to just be really important to us as we get this thing rolled out, get our customers engaged with it, gain access to new customers. I think it's going to be just hugely exciting for us in the back half of the year. I think we still got -- Ken talked about it. We're still very much engaged with customers, getting them enrolled, getting them up to speed on the program. There's still a lot of action in the stores around this thing. But as they, I think, get comfortable with it and begin to work with it, I think that's going to be a big opportunity. There's a lot of action out there with our partners on television and whatnot. There's lots of other people signing up to issue Plenti points. They're not redeemers, but Ken's -- there's a bunch of people who are getting into this thing. So it seems like it's got a lot of momentum around it. I think that could really help us. And we -- the renovations continue to do well. We're seeing some good progress there. So I think we've got a lot of good things going on. It should, hopefully, build into some momentum in the back half. Ken, I don't know if you want to...\n\n---\n\nNo, I think that's right. I think it's -- this is a pretty big lift for us to move all these customers into the new loyalty program. But so far, the reception has been good, and I think this thing just continues to gain momentum as we get it rolled out.\n\n---\n\nSo John and Darren, I guess first question for you is just on the outlook. Like when we think about last year, there was some volatility around the guidance, which for you guys is actually not really normal. So my question for you here is, as you think about this year, it sounds like you feel good about the guidance. But do you like you've got maybe better visibility around things like reimbursements that have been -- like last year were kind of more of an issue?\n\n---\n\nThe visibility continues to improve as these are -- get shorter and we don't look out as far. So based on what we know today, we feel like guidance is in the right range here. There's still lots of things that are going to happen throughout the year. But based on where we sit today, it's still our best view.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then, John, just really to industry consolidation. There has been a lot of news in the marketplace, particularly around the stuff that CVS is doing. But obviously, you guys are on the move, too. And the question really, I guess, is, where do you think you stand today with regards of -- in terms of like having the right pieces to compete long term? And where do you think over time you still may need to strengthen?\n\n---\n\nWell, in the long run, we'd certainly love to have more counters. So I think that's a strategic opportunity for us as we look forward. So we're continuing to peel through ways to kind of -- to work on that. We're excited about Envision, but it may be that there are some things that make sense over time to add to Envision to kind of round it out in terms of its capabilities. But I think those are kind of our primary focus areas. We're putting a lot of capital back into our store base. We think that's important. So the interaction in our stores is really critical to our strategy: the Wellness Ambassadors, the pharmacists, even our front-end associates, coaches from Health Dialog and things we're really trying in clinics. So we're really trying to focus on things that make that experience in the store really what we want it to be. And I think those are the kind of things that we're going to focus on.\n\n---\n\nAnd you didn't mention specialty, John. Is that kind of included with Envision when you talk about that?\n\n---\n\nYes, that's included with Envision. I think there are probably some things that over time may make sense to tack on to Envision, and specialty would be a piece of that.\n\n---\n\nJohn, maybe just start off with -- you talked a little bit about how script trends could get a little softer before they get better. Can you quantify or put any color around the impact of not participating in Med D preferred networks on script trends? And then I guess have a quick follow-up.\n\n---\n\nYes, it's interesting. We are pretty, I'd say, flattish, maybe down just slightly in our Medicare business. So, so far, as -- in this fiscal year, that has not been a huge factor. It hasn't grown a lot, but it hasn't declined a lot either. It's down just slightly. It's really been more, so far this year, a little bit more on the commercial side of our business where we felt some pressure. And there's been a lot of talk about limited networks and those kinds of things, and I think that's probably more where we've seen some pressure early on.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then you rolled right into the second half of my question, which was the commercial pressure that you mentioned earlier. It sounds like that's more volume as opposed to price. And is it -- I guess the volume pressure is preferred networks. But I guess could you kind of qualify price pressure in which and if there's any concentration there?\n\n---\n\nWhen we talk about price pressure, I mean, reimbursement rate is a constant pressure that we unfortunately deal with all the time. So -- and that's reflected in our guidance. I think we've said sort of anecdotally that last year was a pretty tough year and this year is a pretty tough year. Early on -- we think next year is shaping up a little bit better. It's still pretty early on that. But that's kind of the cadence on reimbursement rate pressure. But clearly, there are some limited networks that have proliferated out there, and I think those are putting a little bit of pressure on us.\n\n---\n\nJust a couple of questions from me. I think, first, some of the data we track suggests that generic drug price inflation may have moderated a little bit during your May quarter, both sequentially and year-over-year. And I guess just given the strength in your gross margins this quarter, I wonder if we can read into that maybe as somewhat confirmatory that generic inflation may have moderated. So I'm curious to get your perspective on that topic.\n\n---\n\nI mean, we continue to make progress working with McKesson on generic drug cost. We made some progress last year. Obviously, last year's first quarter was a little tough but throughout the year. We continued to make progress in the first quarter this year from -- so from I guess our view, we continue to make good work there and some progress, so.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then the second question, this one a little bit of a sensitive topic, but when thinking about your May same-store sales, I think some investors perceived it as a little bit soft. I think I saw on some news articles that you guys had 8 stores closed in the Baltimore area around some of the activity that took place there in late April and into May. So I guess I'm just curious, did that have any material impact on your same-store sales for May and/or your results for the overall May quarter? Just curious if that had any material impact.\n\n---\n\nIt did not.\n\n---\n\nI just had a couple questions. I guess talking about your -- the remodeling program, you'll be about 2,000 units at the end of this year, as you guided to. What is a realistic number in terms of the maximum that you would take it to? I understand it's likely not to be 100%. Would it be 70%? What's the right metric to think about as we think about your remodeling reinvestments?\n\n---\n\nI don't know that we've got a number out there. I think as you look forward to the 2,500 stores that'll be out there that have not been remodeled, clearly there is a portion of those that will continue to burn off, that there's stores we don't want to go forward with. But there's a big opportunity for us to relocate a lot of those stores. So between remodels and relocations, I think that's how you have to look at it. And we're -- I think we'll get 33 relocations this year, and we're going to continue to relo these stores as we go. So it's -- some of those stores just -- we don't want to go forward with. But as we relo them, the percentage of the stores will continue to climb. But I don't know that we have a number out there right now that gives you the overall number where we're going to land long term.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then, I guess, could you outline the approximate overlap that you guys have in terms of your storefront with Target and Target's -- and CVS's acquisition of those units? Approximate kind of overlap with that?\n\n---\n\nWell, honestly, they're in a bunch of markets we're not in. I mean, they're in all of our markets, to some degree, I think, just off the top of my head, but they are in a number of markets that we're not. So I don't have a percentage for you or something, but...\n\n---\n\nOkay. Do you have a similar figure, just to remind me, with respect to the overlap of store units that you guys have also with Rite Aid?\n\n---\n\nWell, Rite Aid is 100%.\n\n---\n\nJust a couple things. What is the, and I'm -- I apologize if I missed this. But what is the script count assumption embedded in your guidance, both high and low?\n\n---\n\nWell, I don't think we give an overall script count assumption.\n\n---\n\nIn our guidance, John. It is in [indiscernible].\n\n---\n\nI'm trying to get one, though.\n\n---\n\nWe've got ourselves a range of 2.5% to 4.5%, and that's all the specific metrics we give.\n\n---\n\nSo did the script count in the first quarter track in line with your expectations then? Maybe that's another way to get at this.\n\n---\n\nI think overall it was.\n\n---\n\nPretty close, yes.\n\n---\n\nOkay. So we're kind of in a 1% to -- maybe a 1% to 2% environment, hopefully?\n\n---\n\nYou're looking for a confirmation on that?\n\n---\n\nSure. Got to keep trying, right? And then the second question I have is, you've stepped up your spending. As I look at your CapEx, you're spending $400 million plus a year on both remodels and file buys. Do you still get a 20 percent-ish ROI on that spending?\n\n---\n\nYes, we generally do. I mean, we've said in the past on the remodels if we get a 3% compounded growth on the top line, we see a 20% kind of return. And historically, the file buys are very good, strong returns as well.\n\n---\n\nI think the one caveat, I'll just jump in there, is there is a -- certainly a portion of that CapEx that is that maintenance that we [indiscernible] return calculation. Now some of these stores have not been touched in a while, so there's -- you get into some things that are -- we would kind of consider more maintenance.\n\n---\n\nRight. And I guess my -- I mean, just kind of along that line, the -- going back to an earlier question, how many stores, I mean, do you think you'll eventually -- that are maybe tucked away in dead or dying strip malls that are sub-scale? As you think about relocating -- and this is not a remodel, this is a store lift-out and a newbuild. But how does the return compare on those to just a straight remodel? And what's the approximate scope of opportunity to lift out some of these smaller sub-scale stores?\n\n---\n\nWell, I think the returns are better on a relo than they are on a remodel, generally, because we usually see a more substantial sales lift associated with it. And we've -- as you would expect, there's a group of stores that are identified that we're working pretty hard on to try and find relocation opportunities for. But it's just -- it's one of those things that's got to kind of come together. You need a site and you have to be able to get access to the real estate and all those kinds of things. So it's a process that takes time. It oftentimes can take a number of years to get a relocation site. So we continue to operate some stores with the hopes that we will get it out to the right spot eventually somewhere in the lease cycle. \r\nThank you very much. That concludes our call. We appreciate everybody for joining us today. Thank you very much.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Robert Jones (Analysts)】\nI guess just 2 quick ones on guidance. John, it seems like the raise is entirely from Envision. In light of the strong fundamental performance in the first quarter, just curious, any reason -- why not to think a little bit more positively fundamentally for the balance of the year? And then, Darren, just one quick point of clarification. The $100 million for Envision included -- does it include acquisition-related costs? And how does that compare to the original expectation or the $150 million to $160 million of EBITDA?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nSo I'll go first, I guess. In terms of guidance for the core Rite Aid business, yes, I think we had a very good first quarter, very much in line, I guess, with our expectations. We have a couple of tough quarterly comparisons coming up, the second quarter in particular, so -- I think, as Darren kind of talked about the cadence. So I think guidance for the year still seems appropriate to us.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Darren Karst (Executives)】\nYes, and on the second question, the $100 million does not include any acquisition costs. Those are below the EBITDA line. And the $100 million is basically right on target with what our original expectation was on an annualized basis.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Jones (Analysts)】\nGot it. Now -- and then, John, if I could just sneak one more in -- strategic question. In light of the recent CVS-Target news, I was curious if you saw any similar opportunities out there in the marketplace, whether it be on the big-box side or maybe with even the grocery chain. Any other opportunities like that, that you guys see out there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nI can't point to a specific opportunity. I'll tell you we're -- again, as I think we've said all the way along, we're very open minded and those kinds of opportunities would be interesting to us. But I couldn't point to a specific one at the moment.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Heinbockel (Analysts)】\nJohn, so first, the softness in comp scripts, I know it's largely or I think it's largely Medicaid related. But -- so is there anything you can do to try to spur some share? I guess it's not going to be demand, but share in the short term. And then is it -- do you think -- is it possible that comp scripts go negative before they reaccelerate? Or no, we're pretty close to a bottom here?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nI think they might get a little softer before we're done because we're still kind of in the ramp-up phase. And when you look at the first quarter, although it probably decelerated a little bit as the quarter progressed, we still actually were net up in Medicaid scripts. So a lot of our pressure early on here has been actually on the commercial side of the business. And so as we continue -- as Darren said, as we continue to get to the period here over the next few months where the Medicaid continued to ramp, comps get a little tougher until we kind of cycle this thing, probably around August or so. So that's kind of, I think, the hand-to-hand combat we have in front of us from a script count perspective. But we're working on a lot of exciting stuff. We've got the remodels. We've got plenty out there right now that we're working very hard on. We're going to be out there with our flu shot campaign again this year, pushing very hard. So I think we've got some things to do to help us.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Heinbockel (Analysts)】\nAnd then just on Plenti. So I know that was going to be a little bit disruptive in the short term, actually maybe seems to be a little less so than I would have thought. But where are we with that? And then at what point does this really start to become a customer acquisition vehicle, right, for people that are not wellness+ cardholders?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nKen?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kenneth Martindale (Executives)】\nJohn, it's Ken. Where we are now, obviously, is pretty early. We're not even 2 months into this thing yet. But I think on -- the response from the consumer has been very positive. We're excited about the relationships that we're developing with some of these other brands. And so the -- out of the gates, I think it's pretty positive. You think back to when we launched wellness+, we built this whole thing around really our pharmacy business. And the great thing about Plenti is the way that we've structured this, we've retained all of the benefits that traditionally our customers have had with wellness+, but now they're really pushing the +UPs in the Plenti opportunity, gives them a lot more value and a lot more flexibility. So it's going to take a little while to ramp, and I think it's going to be much like what we saw with wellness+. It will be a gradual build. But I think we're pretty bullish on what we've seen so far.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Lisa Gill (Analysts)】\nI know you don't give quarterly guidance, but just given the outperformance in this quarter, and then, John, I heard you and Darren both talking about some of the headwinds in the back half, the $40 million last year that was beneficial from McKesson, can you maybe just help us understand, was -- one, this quarter, did it come in better than your expectations? Or did we all model it wrong? And secondly, as you look out to the back half of this year, are there things that are different than what we saw in the first quarter, setting aside the onetime benefit that you saw from McKesson last year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nI think -- I guess I have a couple of thoughts and I don't know if, Darren or Ken, you guys want to -- you want to jump in. I think, first of all, the first quarter, I think, was in line with our expectations. Darren has mentioned the $40 million. We have the reimbursement rate pressure that builds throughout the year, but we also have Abilify and Nexium, which we think are going to be [indiscernible] or sometime by the end of the year, and there is some value associated with those. So the way things kind of cycle and play out all the different factors through the numbers, I think that while not giving quarterly guidance, we do think the second quarter's a tougher one and we expect to see some strengthening as we go into the third and fourth quarter. So that's as close as I want to get to any kind of quarterly guidance.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Lisa Gill (Analysts)】\nOkay. And -- but John, as you think about your business, generally speaking, I mean, do you feel like there's anything that's changing either from a reimbursement perspective that you weren't anticipating or anything else that we need to be focused on? Because again, I thought that the -- whether that was your expectation or not in the first quarter, that was a really solid quarter. Here in the first quarter, and we understand what -- you talked a little bit about the headwind, but part of me has to believe that you're still being fairly conservative this year. Or am I wrong?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nYou're -- our -- we feel good about our guidance.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Lisa Gill (Analysts)】\nAll right. And then -- so let me just ask a second question. And that's more on the PBM side of things. It looks like, as you said, you'll close Envision here at the beginning of July. Do you have any updated thoughts around how Envision has done, for example, in the selling season? Has -- have they benefited from the potential opportunity of what they can bring now that they're part of Rite Aid?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nYes, so I think the answer is that Envision is performing in line with our expectations for the first part of their fiscal year. In terms of the selling season, their selling season honestly falls a little bit differently than you've -- you're seeing from the larger PBMs in that smaller clients generally wrap up their process a little bit later in the year. So we're still a little early in their selling season. I would, I guess, anecdotally tell you that they have seen more RFPs come in the door. Since we announced this transaction, I think there's more visibility to Envision. But I think it's a little early for us to tell you the selling season is good, bad or indifferent.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Rhyee (Analysts)】\nWell, just follow-up on the Plenti program here. I think, Ken, you might have made the comment that 2/3 -- you said something about 2/3 of transactions were from Plenti members. Was that -- is that mostly they were Wellness members that also are enrolled in Plenti?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kenneth Martindale (Executives)】\nYes, let me clarify it. Last week, we had 2/3 of the loyalty transactions that went through our store. We always have a number of kind of convenience-related non-member transactions that go through. And obviously, we don't have a lot of intelligence on those because those are just -- they're not tied to any card. But of all the cards that went through our front end and pharmacy last week, 2/3 of those transactions have been linked to a Plenti account. So that -- what that's telling you is that the population of wellness+ members that came in the door, 2/3 of them have already linked to a Plenti account. So we're moving them into the new program at a fairly good clip, and we're pretty happy with that rate.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Rhyee (Analysts)】\nCan you tell, of those 2/3, how many were not -- were just a Plenti member but not a Wellness member? In other words, getting to the earlier question, sort of a new customer acquisition from Plenti?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kenneth Martindale (Executives)】\nIt's still very early, like I said, but we are starting to see some customers coming in that were -- that signed up at our partners and we have not seen them before. So we are starting to see some new customers come in the door.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Rhyee (Analysts)】\nOkay, great. And then a clarification. Darren, in the guidance as well, I know we talked about some of the acquisition costs. Is the debt financing cost, the -- that's included -- that's in the guidance as well? You're absorbing it in the guidance?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Darren Karst (Executives)】\nIt is. You're talking about on the 8% notes, correct?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Rhyee (Analysts)】\nYes, yes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Darren Karst (Executives)】\nIt is.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ross Muken (Analysts)】\nAs you spend more time thinking about Envision and maybe what it could do for you on the specialty front, how do you feel like Orchard could maybe sort of kind of get you deeper into that paradigm, which obviously has very good growth and would be a very strong add to the stores in terms of a specialty retail program? What thinking have you done around sort of different options for what that could bring you?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nFirst of all, it brings us a -- 45 more limited distribution drugs that we didn't have before. So it -- we had a small portfolio of limited distribution drugs. This really gets us into the business, honestly. And so we've gone from nowhere to somewhere kind of overnight with this acquisition. So that's very exciting to us. I think our opportunity with Orchard is to broadly close it to the Rite Aid retail network. I think we have some work to do on the contracting side to kind of bring that to life. But that's a really big opportunity for us. Today, if someone walks into one of our stores, we don't have the drug, we're sending them somewhere else. So all of a sudden, here's 45 more drugs that we can now refer a patient to our own specialty pharmacy. Before we can do that, we need to make sure Orchard is fully contracted, which it is not today. So we have some leg work to do to get to that opportunity. But that is going to significantly expand our scope in terms of what we can do from a specialty perspective. Orchard continues to add additional drugs. They've had some success recently bringing some additional new drugs into their portfolio. And again, I think it's kind of like the whole Envision opportunity. Attaching the Rite Aid brand to it is really raising the awareness of all the things that Envision can do, and we think there's a good opportunity to just organically grow the Orchard specialty business. So we're really excited about it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ross Muken (Analysts)】\nGreat. And not to belabor the point, but I've just gotten a lot of questions this morning on kind of the comp cadence. So we've obviously looked at the macro data, and it sort of is in line also a bit of what you guys are highlighting, at least on a near-term basis. As we think about sort of post-August, what's needed to kind of hit the annual guide, and you obviously gave a number of key drivers. If you had to sort of not put numbers around it but then maybe from like a qualitative perspective kind of give us a sense of where, of those various opportunities, you're likely to see the most uplift. How would you just kind of characterize the top 1 or 2 pieces that are going to drive that back to a more normalized level?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nI'm excited about all the things we're working on. But I -- as it relates to our front-end business and probably indirectly to our pharmacy, I think Plenti is going to just be really important to us as we get this thing rolled out, get our customers engaged with it, gain access to new customers. I think it's going to be just hugely exciting for us in the back half of the year. I think we still got -- Ken talked about it. We're still very much engaged with customers, getting them enrolled, getting them up to speed on the program. There's still a lot of action in the stores around this thing. But as they, I think, get comfortable with it and begin to work with it, I think that's going to be a big opportunity. There's a lot of action out there with our partners on television and whatnot. There's lots of other people signing up to issue Plenti points. They're not redeemers, but Ken's -- there's a bunch of people who are getting into this thing. So it seems like it's got a lot of momentum around it. I think that could really help us. And we -- the renovations continue to do well. We're seeing some good progress there. So I think we've got a lot of good things going on. It should, hopefully, build into some momentum in the back half. Ken, I don't know if you want to...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kenneth Martindale (Executives)】\nNo, I think that's right. I think it's -- this is a pretty big lift for us to move all these customers into the new loyalty program. But so far, the reception has been good, and I think this thing just continues to gain momentum as we get it rolled out.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Edward Kelly (Analysts)】\nSo John and Darren, I guess first question for you is just on the outlook. Like when we think about last year, there was some volatility around the guidance, which for you guys is actually not really normal. So my question for you here is, as you think about this year, it sounds like you feel good about the guidance. But do you like you've got maybe better visibility around things like reimbursements that have been -- like last year were kind of more of an issue?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nThe visibility continues to improve as these are -- get shorter and we don't look out as far. So based on what we know today, we feel like guidance is in the right range here. There's still lots of things that are going to happen throughout the year. But based on where we sit today, it's still our best view.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Edward Kelly (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then, John, just really to industry consolidation. There has been a lot of news in the marketplace, particularly around the stuff that CVS is doing. But obviously, you guys are on the move, too. And the question really, I guess, is, where do you think you stand today with regards of -- in terms of like having the right pieces to compete long term? And where do you think over time you still may need to strengthen?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nWell, in the long run, we'd certainly love to have more counters. So I think that's a strategic opportunity for us as we look forward. So we're continuing to peel through ways to kind of -- to work on that. We're excited about Envision, but it may be that there are some things that make sense over time to add to Envision to kind of round it out in terms of its capabilities. But I think those are kind of our primary focus areas. We're putting a lot of capital back into our store base. We think that's important. So the interaction in our stores is really critical to our strategy: the Wellness Ambassadors, the pharmacists, even our front-end associates, coaches from Health Dialog and things we're really trying in clinics. So we're really trying to focus on things that make that experience in the store really what we want it to be. And I think those are the kind of things that we're going to focus on.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Edward Kelly (Analysts)】\nAnd you didn't mention specialty, John. Is that kind of included with Envision when you talk about that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nYes, that's included with Envision. I think there are probably some things that over time may make sense to tack on to Envision, and specialty would be a piece of that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: George Hill (Analysts)】\nJohn, maybe just start off with -- you talked a little bit about how script trends could get a little softer before they get better. Can you quantify or put any color around the impact of not participating in Med D preferred networks on script trends? And then I guess have a quick follow-up.\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nYes, it's interesting. We are pretty, I'd say, flattish, maybe down just slightly in our Medicare business. So, so far, as -- in this fiscal year, that has not been a huge factor. It hasn't grown a lot, but it hasn't declined a lot either. It's down just slightly. It's really been more, so far this year, a little bit more on the commercial side of our business where we felt some pressure. And there's been a lot of talk about limited networks and those kinds of things, and I think that's probably more where we've seen some pressure early on.\n\n---\n\n【質問: George Hill (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then you rolled right into the second half of my question, which was the commercial pressure that you mentioned earlier. It sounds like that's more volume as opposed to price. And is it -- I guess the volume pressure is preferred networks. But I guess could you kind of qualify price pressure in which and if there's any concentration there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nWhen we talk about price pressure, I mean, reimbursement rate is a constant pressure that we unfortunately deal with all the time. So -- and that's reflected in our guidance. I think we've said sort of anecdotally that last year was a pretty tough year and this year is a pretty tough year. Early on -- we think next year is shaping up a little bit better. It's still pretty early on that. But that's kind of the cadence on reimbursement rate pressure. But clearly, there are some limited networks that have proliferated out there, and I think those are putting a little bit of pressure on us.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Steven Valiquette (Analysts)】\nJust a couple of questions from me. I think, first, some of the data we track suggests that generic drug price inflation may have moderated a little bit during your May quarter, both sequentially and year-over-year. And I guess just given the strength in your gross margins this quarter, I wonder if we can read into that maybe as somewhat confirmatory that generic inflation may have moderated. So I'm curious to get your perspective on that topic.\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nI mean, we continue to make progress working with McKesson on generic drug cost. We made some progress last year. Obviously, last year's first quarter was a little tough but throughout the year. We continued to make progress in the first quarter this year from -- so from I guess our view, we continue to make good work there and some progress, so.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Steven Valiquette (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then the second question, this one a little bit of a sensitive topic, but when thinking about your May same-store sales, I think some investors perceived it as a little bit soft. I think I saw on some news articles that you guys had 8 stores closed in the Baltimore area around some of the activity that took place there in late April and into May. So I guess I'm just curious, did that have any material impact on your same-store sales for May and/or your results for the overall May quarter? Just curious if that had any material impact.\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nIt did not.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Joseph Stauff (Analysts)】\nI just had a couple questions. I guess talking about your -- the remodeling program, you'll be about 2,000 units at the end of this year, as you guided to. What is a realistic number in terms of the maximum that you would take it to? I understand it's likely not to be 100%. Would it be 70%? What's the right metric to think about as we think about your remodeling reinvestments?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kenneth Martindale (Executives)】\nI don't know that we've got a number out there. I think as you look forward to the 2,500 stores that'll be out there that have not been remodeled, clearly there is a portion of those that will continue to burn off, that there's stores we don't want to go forward with. But there's a big opportunity for us to relocate a lot of those stores. So between remodels and relocations, I think that's how you have to look at it. And we're -- I think we'll get 33 relocations this year, and we're going to continue to relo these stores as we go. So it's -- some of those stores just -- we don't want to go forward with. But as we relo them, the percentage of the stores will continue to climb. But I don't know that we have a number out there right now that gives you the overall number where we're going to land long term.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Joseph Stauff (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then, I guess, could you outline the approximate overlap that you guys have in terms of your storefront with Target and Target's -- and CVS's acquisition of those units? Approximate kind of overlap with that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nWell, honestly, they're in a bunch of markets we're not in. I mean, they're in all of our markets, to some degree, I think, just off the top of my head, but they are in a number of markets that we're not. So I don't have a percentage for you or something, but...\n\n---\n\n【質問: Joseph Stauff (Analysts)】\nOkay. Do you have a similar figure, just to remind me, with respect to the overlap of store units that you guys have also with Rite Aid?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nWell, Rite Aid is 100%.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Ransom (Analysts)】\nJust a couple things. What is the, and I'm -- I apologize if I missed this. But what is the script count assumption embedded in your guidance, both high and low?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nWell, I don't think we give an overall script count assumption.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kenneth Martindale (Executives)】\nIn our guidance, John. It is in [indiscernible].\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Ransom (Analysts)】\nI'm trying to get one, though.\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nWe've got ourselves a range of 2.5% to 4.5%, and that's all the specific metrics we give.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Ransom (Analysts)】\nSo did the script count in the first quarter track in line with your expectations then? Maybe that's another way to get at this.\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nI think overall it was.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Darren Karst (Executives)】\nPretty close, yes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Ransom (Analysts)】\nOkay. So we're kind of in a 1% to -- maybe a 1% to 2% environment, hopefully?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nYou're looking for a confirmation on that?\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Ransom (Analysts)】\nSure. Got to keep trying, right? And then the second question I have is, you've stepped up your spending. As I look at your CapEx, you're spending $400 million plus a year on both remodels and file buys. Do you still get a 20 percent-ish ROI on that spending?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Darren Karst (Executives)】\nYes, we generally do. I mean, we've said in the past on the remodels if we get a 3% compounded growth on the top line, we see a 20% kind of return. And historically, the file buys are very good, strong returns as well.\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nI think the one caveat, I'll just jump in there, is there is a -- certainly a portion of that CapEx that is that maintenance that we [indiscernible] return calculation. Now some of these stores have not been touched in a while, so there's -- you get into some things that are -- we would kind of consider more maintenance.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Ransom (Analysts)】\nRight. And I guess my -- I mean, just kind of along that line, the -- going back to an earlier question, how many stores, I mean, do you think you'll eventually -- that are maybe tucked away in dead or dying strip malls that are sub-scale? As you think about relocating -- and this is not a remodel, this is a store lift-out and a newbuild. But how does the return compare on those to just a straight remodel? And what's the approximate scope of opportunity to lift out some of these smaller sub-scale stores?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nWell, I think the returns are better on a relo than they are on a remodel, generally, because we usually see a more substantial sales lift associated with it. And we've -- as you would expect, there's a group of stores that are identified that we're working pretty hard on to try and find relocation opportunities for. But it's just -- it's one of those things that's got to kind of come together. You need a site and you have to be able to get access to the real estate and all those kinds of things. So it's a process that takes time. It oftentimes can take a number of years to get a relocation site. So we continue to operate some stores with the hopes that we will get it out to the right spot eventually somewhere in the lease cycle. \r\nThank you very much. That concludes our call.

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you, and welcome to this telephone conference on the occasion of H&M's 6-month results 2015. Our CFO, Jyrki Tervonen, is with me today again, and we'll be happy to answer your questions after the presentation. You'll find the presentation slides for this telephone conference on hm.com. \r\nLooking at the first half year on brief. H&M has continued to perform well, with well-received collections for all group brands and successful expansion with stores and online. Sales developed strongly, and we continued taking market share. \r\nProfit also developed well, with an increase of 19% in the first half year. This is despite the fact that the increasingly strong U.S. dollar has pushed up purchasing costs and that we have continued to increase our long-term investments compared to last year. \r\nOur long-term investments are necessary in order to build an even stronger H&M. Among other things, these investments would enable us to be a natural part of our customers' increasingly digital world, where the distinction between shopping online and the physical stores is fading. Our goal is to offer a customer experience where online and stores are closely interwoven. This will strengthen our customer offering further. \r\nNow to look at sales on the second quarter, please turn to the graph Sales. Sales development in the second quarter remained strong, especially given the more challenging conditions that we faced, with strong comparable figures, sales grew 16% in local currencies in Q2 last year; unfavorable weather, this spring the weather was unusually cold in many of our important markets in Europe; and negative calendar effect of approximately 2 percentage points. \r\nIn local currencies, sales increased by 10%. Translated into SEK, sales including VAT amounted to SEK 53.2 billion. That is an increase of 20% from the second quarter of last year. Sales for the first half year reached more than SEK 100 billion, an increase of 12% in local currencies and 22% in SEK. \r\nAnd now to look at results, please turn to the next slide. Gross profit in the second quarter was SEK 27.2 billion. That corresponds to gross margin of 59.4% compared to 60.8% last year. The combined effect on the purchasing costs from the external factors was negative. This is mainly due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, and markdowns in relation to sales increased slightly compared to the second quarter last year by approximately 30 basis points. For the 6-month period, gross profit amounted to SEK 49.5 billion with a gross margin of 57.4%. \r\nPlease turn to the slide SG&A. Cost control in the group remained good. In the second quarter, selling and administration costs increased by 22% in SEK to SEK 18.9 billion. In local currencies, the increase was 12%. The increase in SG&A is mainly related to the expansion and the long-term investments. \r\nTo look at profits, please turn to the next slide. Profit after financial items increased by 10% to SEK 8.4 billion in the second quarter and by 18% to SEK 13.3 billion in the 6-month period. Profits were impacted by positive currency translation effects from when we translate our subsidiaries' results into SEK, but also by the negative transaction effects from the strong U.S. dollar on purchasing costs. Higher costs for long-term investments also had a negative effect on profits. \r\nPlease turn to the next slide. With an estimated tax rate of 23.5%, tax amounted to nearly SEK 2 billion, and net profit increased by 11% to SEK 6.5 billion in the second quarter. This equals earnings per share of SEK 3.90, up from SEK 3.51 last year. \r\nAnd now for some more key data, please turn to the next slide. Stock-in-trade on the 31st of May amounted to almost SEK 20 billion, an increase of 32% in SEK. In local currencies, the increase was 27%. Both the composition and the level of the stock-in-trade are considered good. The reported increase in the stock-in-trade is explained by the store and online expansion as well as by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. As the dollar appreciation has impacted purchasing costs, the value of the stock-in-trade has also been affected. And as a share of sales, stock-in-trade was 11.8% compared to 10.8% last year. \r\nCash flow from the current operations was SEK 13.6 billion, up from SEK 11.9 billion. And investments in terms of CapEx totaled SEK 4.7 billion for the first half year compared with SEK 3.9 billion last year. Investments covered mainly new stores but also IT and logistics. For 2015, CapEx is still expected to reach approximately SEK 11 billion to SEK 11.5 billion based on the exchange rates from 30th of November 2014. \r\nFinancial position of the H&M Group remained strong. Liquid funds increased from SEK 9.6 billion to SEK 10.3 billion, and that is after the dividend payments of SEK 16.1 billion. Return on equity was more or less unchanged at 50.3%. \r\nAnd now for some words on expansion, please look at the slide Store Expansion 2015. H&M's strong expansion continues. In total, we will open approximately 400 new stores net in 2015. The largest expansion is taking place in existing markets, with China and the U.S. hosting the highest number of new store openings. In New York, for example, we opened a new flagship store in May on Herald Square in Manhattan. It is the largest H&M store to date, and we are very happy with the customer reception. \r\nDuring the first half year, we added 128 new stores net, and at the end of the period, we had a total of 3,639 stores, all group brands included. We're adding 5 new H&M markets this year. Taiwan, Peru and Macau have already opened, and the customer response has been very good in all 3 markets. And now we're looking forward to the opening -- to opening the first stores in India and South Africa, 2 interesting and large markets where we see great potential for H&M. The first stores will be in New Delhi and in Cape Town, and they will open towards the end of the year. And expansion continues for all our brands. \r\nPlease turn to the next slide. The newer fashion brands of the H&M Group are COS, & Other Stories, Monki, Weekday and Cheap Monday. Expansion for these brands in 2015 will focus mainly on & Other Stories and COS. Both these brands will open more new stores in 2015 than in 2014. COS will add at least 4 new markets this year. Bahrain opened with franchise in February. Luxembourg, the Czech Republic and Canada are planned to open in the autumn. \r\nIn parallel with our store expansion, we are also adding new H&M online markets. Please turn to the next slide. H&M's online store, hm.com, is opening in 9 new markets in 2015. Eight of them opened already this spring: Portugal, Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania, Slovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria and Belgium. All of them have been very well received. With the addition of Switzerland this autumn, there will be 22 H&M online markets, and we continue our preparations to roll out the H&M online store to the rest of the group in the years to come. H&M is reaching more and more customers globally, and we keep developing our customer offering with new fashion initiatives and new concepts. \r\nPlease turn to the slide H&M Beauty. H&M Beauty is our latest initiative. This new concept will be rolled out gradually in 900 stores in 40 markets as well as online starting in July. H&M Beauty will offer a broad range of makeup, body care and hair care. The products will be of high quality at very good prices and in specialty designed packaging. This winter, 2 subsidiary collections will also be added, a premium beauty line for body care and a conscious range of Ecocert-approved sustainable products. H&M Beauty is one example of all the investments we are making in order to broaden H&M's product range even further. \r\nAnd now before we move on to the Q&A session, just some words on current developments. June has started well. Sales in the period -- in the 1st to the 23rd of June increased by 14% in local currency compared to the same period last year. Meanwhile, if we look at market conditions regarding sourcing, we see that the market situation regarding the external factors for the purchasing period through the third and fourth quarter of 2015 is very negative. This is, again, because of the substantial strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most currencies, which has led to substantially higher purchasing costs compared to the corresponding purchasing periods in the previous year. We have great faith in our offering, and although the increasingly strong U.S. dollar will result in gradually higher purchasing costs when sourcing for the coming quarters of 2015, H&M will still make sure to have the best customer offering in each individual markets. \r\nAnd with that, we are now happy to take your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.",

[Operator Instructions] Thank you.",
      "transcript_text3": "Just a quick question on the incremental investment costs in Q2. Can you, as you did in the first quarter, highlight what the amount was and how that was split between cost of goods sold and OpEx, please?\n\n---\n\nYes. In Q2, the incremental cost was approx SEK 150 million, and it's divided more or less 50-50 on cost of goods sold and SG&A.\n\n---\n\nI just have 1 question. When you say that you expect purchasing costs and external factors to be very negative in the second half of this year, is that a change compared to exactly what you said at the end of fiscal Q1, please?\n\n---\n\nThere's no change to what we said in connection with the Q1 report.\n\n---\n\nI just got a question, guys, on the capacity situation you're seeing amongst your major suppliers. I know you -- it's one of the external factors on margin. How are you seeing the capacity situation? Are you seeing any excess capacity coming onstream in Asia?\n\n---\n\nIt's pretty stable at the moment, and so nothing dramatic. But -- yes, more or less, neutral.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And just one follow-up. On customer loyalty, can you just give us an update on which markets you've introduced some sort of loyalty scheming for customers? And what are the plans there? And how is that going?\n\n---\n\nCertainly, we have, since many years, a loyalty scheme in Sweden and Denmark. And last year, we introduced a new program in Austria and The Netherlands. And of course, the results are -- we're very happy with the results, and the plan is to continue to roll out in the rest of the group.\n\n---\n\nOkay. But should we expect a big increase in new markets for that this year or it's going to be fairly steady?\n\n---\n\nI think we will come back when we have more information. But of course, the plan is to roll it out. Again, it's a balance of quality and speed.\n\n---\n\nCedric Lecasble from Raymond James. I have a question on your new segment initiatives. Could you update us on where you stand in sports and in your active outfit and where you want to take it? And maybe where do you see these new segments, sports, beauty, that you are adding to your offer as a percentage of your global sales within, I don't know, 3, 5 years maybe?\n\n---\n\nYes. Again, I tried to remind you 1 question at a time. But regarding our new initiatives, you asked about beauty, shoes -- extended shoes and sports, we are happy with all of them. Well, beauty, we are just about to launch, but it looks very promising at least. And regarding sports and extended shoes, we are in early stage. But so far, we're very happy, and we continue to roll it out in the group.\n\n---\n\nCan you tell us -- sort of give us an update on your views on average selling prices for the autumn, winter and spring/summer '16 -- '15 and '16 and whether you think there's any capacity for adjustment slightly in order to try to dampen the impact of the purchasing [ph] cost inflation?\n\n---\n\nThis is, of course, the million-dollar question. And as you very much know, for us, it's always about having the best combination of fashion, price and quality in a sustainable way, and we will never be the first ones to raise prices. So it will be very interesting to see what's going to happen this autumn.\n\n---\n\nSo at present, prices are relatively stable ahead of the season -- price expectations are stable ahead of the season, is that right?\n\n---\n\nAs you know, we don't comment on our pricing strategy apart from what I've just said, sorry.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And may I just ask -- you said that the CapEx guidance is SEK 11 billion to SEK 11.5 billion as at currency at the end of November. What would the guidance be at current rates, please?\n\n---\n\nThe guidance is still that it will land somewhere between SEK 11 billion and SEK 11.5 billion. And as you -- I think you mentioned, it's based on the currency rates prevailing at the year-end closing. So when translating that to Swedish krona, it can differ at the end of the year, but it's the same guidance when it comes to CapEx.\n\n---\n\nI had a number of questions but all related.\n\n---\n\nPlease, one at a time.\n\n---\n\nOn the operating cost in the quarter, firstly, in the past, you've been kind enough to indicate whether comparable store costs rose or fell in the quarter. Just want to gauge that aspect as opposed to the expansion.\n\n---\n\nThe cost in comparable units, they increased during Q2. So there was an increase.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And on the calendar impact, which you've said it was negative 2% on the revenues, would that also be negative 2% on the costs? Or...\n\n---\n\nNo, that's the fact because even when we -- the stores are closed due to a Christian holiday, whatever it is, we still pay rent in most cases, right? So that's why it's important to be aware of the calendar impact because it clearly affects top line but not so much on the cost side.\n\n---\n\nAnd sorry, the third part of that was the long-term cost investment. You indicated SEK 150 million more in the quarter. Can you confirm that the guidance for the full year, I think it was SEK 400 million to SEK 600 million, is still as it stands?\n\n---\n\nYes, it stands still.\n\n---\n\nAnd my question is about the incremental costs, not for this year but what you're thinking for next year at this point. I mean, do you think there'll be incremental costs in addition to this year's level or the same level or a decrease? Do you have any idea about that yet, please?\n\n---\n\nWell, it's far too early to talk about 2016. But as we many times said, we have a lot of good initiatives where we see possibilities. So I'm convinced that we will find really good business cases also for 2016. So -- but we will come back to that in connection with our full year report.\n\n---\n\nCan you just talk a little bit about your input costs? Obviously, you talked about FX. But if you exclude FX, is there any material increase or decrease in dollar terms?\n\n---\n\nNo, not really. I mean, we talked about these external factors, such as raw material costs and capacity, salaries, et cetera, and the sum of it, as we said, they are very negative for the purchasing period now, for the quarters to follow. But if you break it down, of course, some -- I mean, obviously, cotton prices have come down a little bit, so that's a positive. Capacity is more or less neutral. Salaries are up, which is good, we think, because this is something we actively drive for sustainability reasons. So I mean, no dramatic changes I would say. But at the end of the day, I mean, I'm talking about market prices now. Then, of course, we could negotiate better or for some reason, have different output in our results for other reasons. But as I said, more or less, neutral for the world, except for U.S. dollar.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then just following that on into your inventory. And obviously, you said that most of that is down to the U.S. dollar and to the increases in capacity. How should we think about the kind of markdown risk? I mean, do you consider your inventory in reasonably good shape, therefore, there is no incremental markdown risk in the second half of the year?\n\n---\n\nYes. As we stated, at the end of the second quarter, the stock-in-trade level is good and so is the composition. But when it comes to reductions in Q3, it's still over 2 months to go, so it's far too early to draw any conclusions based only on the stock-in-trade levels and the composition. We don't know what the selling turnover circumstances will be for the coming months.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And can I just ask a quick question about the June trading statement? Is it -- how much of that is down to a calendar effect?\n\n---\n\nRight. There is a calendar impact. For the full of June, we estimate it to be around 3%, and all of that is included in this 14%.\n\n---\n\nOkay. So it's probably a bit lumpier then -- at the margin then?\n\n---\n\nWell, of course, I mean, if you take away the net for the calendar impact, the top line is lower, right, absolutely.\n\n---\n\nTwo questions I have, one at a time. The first question is on some consumer behavior in several of your territories. So what I've noticed, if you do a simplified version of like-for-likes, if you try to do that, Northern Europe and Central Europe have experienced a decline in the same-store sales, while in Southern Europe and Eastern Europe, we've got a very strong like-for-like momentum there. And even the U.S. is doing well, which might come, especially in Europe, as a bit of a surprise given the different states of the economy of the different territories you're in. Have you noticed any major change in consumer behavior in the 2 territories? And would you have any comment of why this -- of why your sales have such a behavior?\n\n---\n\nYes. It's very simple, because the cold spring we talked about is mainly in the central and northern parts of Europe.\n\n---\n\nRight. And in terms of Southern Europe and Eastern Europe, you don't see -- well, Southern Europe, you don't see any impact from the tough economic conditions there?\n\n---\n\nOf course, we do, but we've had actually pretty strong development in Southern Europe for more than a year now, even in countries like Greece.\n\n---\n\nAnd do you envision because people are trading down or because your product has improved?\n\n---\n\nNo, I don't think it's as simple as consumers are trading down. I think we've touched upon this many times before. We have -- we're very consistent, and we have been since -- we are continuous in what we do. And we continue to expand, and the customers appreciate what we do. I think that's as simple as that.\n\n---\n\nBut specifically looking at the second quarter and maybe at the end part of the second quarter, I think we -- as we said, we have a good custom offering in all markets. And -- but as Nils said, it has been much more unfavorable weather in the northern parts of Europe, Scandinavia and Northern Europe. Central Europe and the southern parts, they have favorable weather. So that's, of course, affecting our turnover.\n\n---\n\nThis is also reflected in the market statistics you're seeing from Germany and Sweden, where Sweden in May was down 9%, I think, and Germany was down 5% or something. And we outperformed the markets.\n\n---\n\nOkay, that's fair enough. The second question, if you can give any comment on -- if you do have the data on the average basket value differential between a customer at an H&M store, a COS store and an & Other Stories store. What would be, you think, the -- how much, on average, would a normal customer spend more, I guess, on COS, & Other Stories versus H&M?\n\n---\n\nWell, as you know, we prefer not to go into details such as customer basket size or ASP, et cetera. But of course, COS, & Other Stories, they have the same -- more or less, the same business idea, which is fashion quality at best price in a sustainable way, but of course, in a higher price level -- price range. So that means that price baskets typically should be higher.\n\n---\n\nOkay. But I guess volume should be lower. So would you say that sort of at least the value of the basket will be higher than H&M?\n\n---\n\nWell, that's just what I said, the value per basket per -- yes, it should be higher, absolutely.\n\n---\n\nYou talked about the strong reception from your e-commerce offers as you've launched them in new markets. And I'm just wondering, has those launches caused you to reconsider your store expansion plans at all, either reducing the number of stores that you're opening or changing the kind of store, maybe not opening as many small stores and focusing more on flagship stores?\n\n---\n\nIt's true that e-commerce is growing, but we see potential to continue to grow both in the physical stores and at the same time, on the e-commerce. So we think that, that can be the situation for many years to come. But we have a lot of the expansion still in existing markets and on new markets when it comes to physical stores. So we are doing them both and seeing huge potential in both channels.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And so no type even to the -- no change even to the type of store that you open given e-commerce growth?\n\n---\n\nNo. We're -- on the opposite, sometimes, we are looking into broadening our offer -- existing offers in both channels, both in the e-commerce channel but also in physical stores. We have added H&M Sport, extended shoes. Now we are launching the beauty line, so we have also extended existing store space if it's possible.\n\n---\n\nCan you please give a little bit of an update on omni-channel initiatives, where you stand there? And then as you open more H&Ms globally, how do you think of backfilling in with secondary concepts in the different markets?\n\n---\n\nRight. Regarding omni channel, I think we've touched upon this before. We are investing a lot, and we are adding and improving. And as well -- at the same time as we are expanding into new markets, we are also improving the customer offering online, customer experience, and we've had, for example, return in store in many countries now. We have the scan-and-buy function in many countries. We have the loyalty scheme. We have broadened the assortments, et cetera, et cetera. So a lot of things going on and a lot of things happening. Regarding your other question, we are launching the other brands, expanding them at a faster speed in percentage than H&M. It's primarily COS, & Other Stories this year, but we are also looking to speed up Monki going forward and Weekday. And as you know, we have launched COS, & Other Stories in the U.S., and we are very happy with that. And of course, this year, as I mentioned, there would be at least 4 new markets for COS, and we're very excited about that.\n\n---\n\nI'm going to try a slightly different concept. Maybe I'll ask 2 questions, and then you can choose which one you answer. Firstly, I noticed that in Russia, you increased some of your prices. Was that following on from seeing competitors increase their prices largely due to the FX issues? That's the first one. And then secondly, you just mentioned, following on from that last question, about the growth in the other concept. What proportion of sales is coming through the H&M brand now? And of the stores opening this year, how many of them are H&M compared to the other concepts, please?\n\n---\n\nStarting with Russia. I mean, the whole market has increased or adjusted prices through the collapse of the ruble. So of course, we continuously monitor pricing and competitors and sourcing and some natural parts. So that's nothing new. That happens all the time, not just when currencies move as quickly as they've done at the moment. So nothing new about that. And regarding the other question, there is -- I think in the report, we state how many stores -- we break it down per brand, and that gives you an idea about the expansion. And I don't see any dramatic changes going forward.\n\n---\n\nOkay. At what stage -- roughly what percentage of sales would they contribute to the group now?\n\n---\n\nThe vast majority of the sales is, of course, H&M. But we are very happy with the other brands, and they are -- we're seeing great potential for each of them.\n\n---\n\nIt's Rebecca again. I was just wondering whether you could quantify what you mean by very negative in terms of the impact of the external factors on purchasing [ph] costs in terms of what we might expect for the gross margin in the second half and into 2016.\n\n---\n\nAgain, let me remind you that we will not give any guidance on gross margin. This is a very, as you know, very competitive industry, and there is no pattern or anything that we can give. So this is something we keep to ourselves. And for us, it's always about having the best customer offering, and the gross margin is a result of that.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And secondly, would you expect a higher volume of garments into the sort of summer sales given sort of levels of inventory at the end of the second quarter?\n\n---\n\nAs we said, the stock-in-trade level is on a good level at the end of Q2. And what the reduction levels will be when ending Q3, we have to come back to because it's still over 2 months to go. So that we will come back to in connection with Q3 report.\n\n---\n\nBut you're asking about the quantity, right?\n\n---\n\nYes, the volume of products for the end-of-season sale -- summer sale.\n\n---\n\nWe don't break that out, sorry.\n\n---\n\nJust wanted to ask about the inventory position. If we take the local currency sales increase of 27%, I think you said that a big piece comes from, obviously, expansion and also inventory for new online markets. But also a big piece is clearly the U.S. dollar. Given your sort of speed of inventory turn, isn't it sensible to think that the bit that relates to the U.S. dollar is really what's going to impact your P&L in the next quarter?\n\n---\n\nYes, of course. What's in the stock-in-trade in Q2, so of course, that will come through the P&L when we are selling the garments. So you will see the effect in Q3. That's true.\n\n---\n\nRight. So if I've got 27% local currency inventory increase, and this is my analysis and obviously not your guidance, I understand that. If, let's say, 15% of that relates to expansion and some of your new online markets, then we would be looking at a 12% cost headwind in the P&L in the coming quarter. Obviously, all else equal, which it never is, obviously prices move and that kind of thing, but is that a fair way to think about the inventory number we're looking at?\n\n---\n\nAs we have many times said, we won't -- we don't want to elaborate and go into more details when it comes to how the composition and what's exactly the impact from different factors, but we are happy with the level and the composition. And there is a huge U.S. dollar impact on the stock-in-trade, and that will, of course, be released through the P&L during the next -- or the Q3.\n\n---\n\nOn the newswires this morning, there was a comment that you guys are looking at maybe launching another new banner in 2017. Could you elaborate on what was said this morning? And also, on the existing other banners, can you confirm that returns are similar to the rollout of H&M concept?\n\n---\n\nAgain, 1 question at a time. The first rumor you referred to was a comment the CEO made this morning regarding our new business department that are looking into new things all the time, and yes, there are some concrete things that we are looking into. But I don't think he mentioned 2017. He said going forward.\n\n---\n\nOkay, yes, sorry. So the second question was, so for the rollout of the other concepts, & Other Stories and COS, can you confirm that the margins -- return on capital profile or however you appraise the economics for those is comparable to the rollout of the H&M concepts?\n\n---\n\nWell, we don't -- we should not -- we choose not to comment profitability per concept, brand or market. And of course, initially when you launch a brand, there's a lot of costs connected to that and margins are not where we want them to be in the long term, of course. But I mean, we see great opportunities for -- and potential for all of the brands. But more than that, we don't want to comment the profitability.\n\n---\n\nJust back to the gross margin, maybe trying to slice it one other way and get a bit more information. Was there any hedging benefit in the gross margin move in the second quarter? And given you've got reasonably short hedging period, would it be fair to assume then through Q3 and Q4, you should at the end of Q4, broadly have annualized the current euro, dollar or -- dollar, SEK rate? Or would you be still expecting a further gross margin impact next year, all else being equal?\n\n---\n\nThe first question regarding hedging gains, could you specify?\n\n---\n\nWell, I'm just wondering if there was still -- you still have some hedges which are rolling off in the second quarter that would have benefited at all your inventory or your COGS and protected you in terms of the gross margin, obviously. Has that been rolled out -- or rolled off, you don't have that positive impact in Q3, Q4? I'm just trying to get a sense of when this whole -- the fall in the euro -- Swedish krona relative to the dollar will fully annualize in your gross margins.\n\n---\n\nOf course, there's always a mix of inventories going from Q2 to Q3, et cetera, but the negative impact from the U.S. dollar in Q3 and Q4 is much more negative than for those garments that we bought for Q2. And when it comes to Q1 next year, 2016, we haven't started to buy the products at this stage. But if the U.S. dollar will be on this level, it most probably will cause a headwind when it comes to negative impact on our purchasing prices also for Q1.\n\n---\n\nTwo questions, again, one at a time. Could you talk about the pervasiveness of the loyalty program, how well it's been adopted, how many more markets can it be rolled out and perhaps how large it is, either qualitatively or quantitatively? And then if you could talk briefly about the Southern Hemisphere and some of the unique challenges you've been able to overcome in expanding down there.\n\n---\n\nOkay. First question regarding loyalty scheme, as I said, we launched it -- we started to launch it end of last year. And it was -- so far, we only have it in 2 markets, this new version of loyalty scheme, and we are very happy so far. But I don't -- I can't give you any more details at this moment going forward. But of course, this is something we believe a lot in, and we want to roll out. The plan is to roll it out in the rest of the group, okay? And the next question was regarding Southern Hemisphere. And we have now a strong beachhead into Southern Hemisphere. We have stores, as you know, in South America, Australia, and we're very excited about the launch coming up in South Africa. And so we see a -- we have now a process how to handle the reverse seasonality, and obviously, it works well. So now it's just to scale it up.\n\n---\n\nOn the gross margin, could you please quantify what very negative means versus just negative?\n\n---\n\nA lot of questions regarding gross margin. Again, we won't be able to give you any more flavor than what we have said already, I'm sorry.\n\n---\n\nOkay. If there are no more questions, I'd like to thank you, all, very much for participating in this conference call. And we'll come back for the third quarter results on the 24th of September. Goodbye.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Paul Steegers (Analysts)】\nJust a quick question on the incremental investment costs in Q2. Can you, as you did in the first quarter, highlight what the amount was and how that was split between cost of goods sold and OpEx, please?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nYes. In Q2, the incremental cost was approx SEK 150 million, and it's divided more or less 50-50 on cost of goods sold and SG&A.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Nicklas Fhärm (Analysts)】\nI just have 1 question. When you say that you expect purchasing costs and external factors to be very negative in the second half of this year, is that a change compared to exactly what you said at the end of fiscal Q1, please?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nThere's no change to what we said in connection with the Q1 report.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Richard Chamberlain (Analysts)】\nI just got a question, guys, on the capacity situation you're seeing amongst your major suppliers. I know you -- it's one of the external factors on margin. How are you seeing the capacity situation? Are you seeing any excess capacity coming onstream in Asia?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nIt's pretty stable at the moment, and so nothing dramatic. But -- yes, more or less, neutral.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Richard Chamberlain (Analysts)】\nOkay. And just one follow-up. On customer loyalty, can you just give us an update on which markets you've introduced some sort of loyalty scheming for customers? And what are the plans there? And how is that going?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nCertainly, we have, since many years, a loyalty scheme in Sweden and Denmark. And last year, we introduced a new program in Austria and The Netherlands. And of course, the results are -- we're very happy with the results, and the plan is to continue to roll out in the rest of the group.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Richard Chamberlain (Analysts)】\nOkay. But should we expect a big increase in new markets for that this year or it's going to be fairly steady?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nI think we will come back when we have more information. But of course, the plan is to roll it out. Again, it's a balance of quality and speed.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Cedric Lecasble (Analysts)】\nCedric Lecasble from Raymond James. I have a question on your new segment initiatives. Could you update us on where you stand in sports and in your active outfit and where you want to take it? And maybe where do you see these new segments, sports, beauty, that you are adding to your offer as a percentage of your global sales within, I don't know, 3, 5 years maybe?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nYes. Again, I tried to remind you 1 question at a time. But regarding our new initiatives, you asked about beauty, shoes -- extended shoes and sports, we are happy with all of them. Well, beauty, we are just about to launch, but it looks very promising at least. And regarding sports and extended shoes, we are in early stage. But so far, we're very happy, and we continue to roll it out in the group.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rebecca McClellan (Analysts)】\nCan you tell us -- sort of give us an update on your views on average selling prices for the autumn, winter and spring/summer '16 -- '15 and '16 and whether you think there's any capacity for adjustment slightly in order to try to dampen the impact of the purchasing [ph] cost inflation?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nThis is, of course, the million-dollar question. And as you very much know, for us, it's always about having the best combination of fashion, price and quality in a sustainable way, and we will never be the first ones to raise prices. So it will be very interesting to see what's going to happen this autumn.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rebecca McClellan (Analysts)】\nSo at present, prices are relatively stable ahead of the season -- price expectations are stable ahead of the season, is that right?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nAs you know, we don't comment on our pricing strategy apart from what I've just said, sorry.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rebecca McClellan (Analysts)】\nOkay. And may I just ask -- you said that the CapEx guidance is SEK 11 billion to SEK 11.5 billion as at currency at the end of November. What would the guidance be at current rates, please?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nThe guidance is still that it will land somewhere between SEK 11 billion and SEK 11.5 billion. And as you -- I think you mentioned, it's based on the currency rates prevailing at the year-end closing. So when translating that to Swedish krona, it can differ at the end of the year, but it's the same guidance when it comes to CapEx.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charlie Muir-Sands (Analysts)】\nI had a number of questions but all related.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nPlease, one at a time.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charlie Muir-Sands (Analysts)】\nOn the operating cost in the quarter, firstly, in the past, you've been kind enough to indicate whether comparable store costs rose or fell in the quarter. Just want to gauge that aspect as opposed to the expansion.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nThe cost in comparable units, they increased during Q2. So there was an increase.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charlie Muir-Sands (Analysts)】\nOkay. And on the calendar impact, which you've said it was negative 2% on the revenues, would that also be negative 2% on the costs? Or...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nNo, that's the fact because even when we -- the stores are closed due to a Christian holiday, whatever it is, we still pay rent in most cases, right? So that's why it's important to be aware of the calendar impact because it clearly affects top line but not so much on the cost side.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charlie Muir-Sands (Analysts)】\nAnd sorry, the third part of that was the long-term cost investment. You indicated SEK 150 million more in the quarter. Can you confirm that the guidance for the full year, I think it was SEK 400 million to SEK 600 million, is still as it stands?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nYes, it stands still.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Anne Critchlow (Analysts)】\nAnd my question is about the incremental costs, not for this year but what you're thinking for next year at this point. I mean, do you think there'll be incremental costs in addition to this year's level or the same level or a decrease? Do you have any idea about that yet, please?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nWell, it's far too early to talk about 2016. But as we many times said, we have a lot of good initiatives where we see possibilities. So I'm convinced that we will find really good business cases also for 2016. So -- but we will come back to that in connection with our full year report.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Simon Irwin (Analysts)】\nCan you just talk a little bit about your input costs? Obviously, you talked about FX. But if you exclude FX, is there any material increase or decrease in dollar terms?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nNo, not really. I mean, we talked about these external factors, such as raw material costs and capacity, salaries, et cetera, and the sum of it, as we said, they are very negative for the purchasing period now, for the quarters to follow. But if you break it down, of course, some -- I mean, obviously, cotton prices have come down a little bit, so that's a positive. Capacity is more or less neutral. Salaries are up, which is good, we think, because this is something we actively drive for sustainability reasons. So I mean, no dramatic changes I would say. But at the end of the day, I mean, I'm talking about market prices now. Then, of course, we could negotiate better or for some reason, have different output in our results for other reasons. But as I said, more or less, neutral for the world, except for U.S. dollar.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Simon Irwin (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then just following that on into your inventory. And obviously, you said that most of that is down to the U.S. dollar and to the increases in capacity. How should we think about the kind of markdown risk? I mean, do you consider your inventory in reasonably good shape, therefore, there is no incremental markdown risk in the second half of the year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nYes. As we stated, at the end of the second quarter, the stock-in-trade level is good and so is the composition. But when it comes to reductions in Q3, it's still over 2 months to go, so it's far too early to draw any conclusions based only on the stock-in-trade levels and the composition. We don't know what the selling turnover circumstances will be for the coming months.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Simon Irwin (Analysts)】\nOkay. And can I just ask a quick question about the June trading statement? Is it -- how much of that is down to a calendar effect?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nRight. There is a calendar impact. For the full of June, we estimate it to be around 3%, and all of that is included in this 14%.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Simon Irwin (Analysts)】\nOkay. So it's probably a bit lumpier then -- at the margin then?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nWell, of course, I mean, if you take away the net for the calendar impact, the top line is lower, right, absolutely.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chris Chaviaras (Analysts)】\nTwo questions I have, one at a time. The first question is on some consumer behavior in several of your territories. So what I've noticed, if you do a simplified version of like-for-likes, if you try to do that, Northern Europe and Central Europe have experienced a decline in the same-store sales, while in Southern Europe and Eastern Europe, we've got a very strong like-for-like momentum there. And even the U.S. is doing well, which might come, especially in Europe, as a bit of a surprise given the different states of the economy of the different territories you're in. Have you noticed any major change in consumer behavior in the 2 territories? And would you have any comment of why this -- of why your sales have such a behavior?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nYes. It's very simple, because the cold spring we talked about is mainly in the central and northern parts of Europe.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chris Chaviaras (Analysts)】\nRight. And in terms of Southern Europe and Eastern Europe, you don't see -- well, Southern Europe, you don't see any impact from the tough economic conditions there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nOf course, we do, but we've had actually pretty strong development in Southern Europe for more than a year now, even in countries like Greece.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chris Chaviaras (Analysts)】\nAnd do you envision because people are trading down or because your product has improved?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nNo, I don't think it's as simple as consumers are trading down. I think we've touched upon this many times before. We have -- we're very consistent, and we have been since -- we are continuous in what we do. And we continue to expand, and the customers appreciate what we do. I think that's as simple as that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nBut specifically looking at the second quarter and maybe at the end part of the second quarter, I think we -- as we said, we have a good custom offering in all markets. And -- but as Nils said, it has been much more unfavorable weather in the northern parts of Europe, Scandinavia and Northern Europe. Central Europe and the southern parts, they have favorable weather. So that's, of course, affecting our turnover.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nThis is also reflected in the market statistics you're seeing from Germany and Sweden, where Sweden in May was down 9%, I think, and Germany was down 5% or something. And we outperformed the markets.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chris Chaviaras (Analysts)】\nOkay, that's fair enough. The second question, if you can give any comment on -- if you do have the data on the average basket value differential between a customer at an H&M store, a COS store and an & Other Stories store. What would be, you think, the -- how much, on average, would a normal customer spend more, I guess, on COS, & Other Stories versus H&M?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nWell, as you know, we prefer not to go into details such as customer basket size or ASP, et cetera. But of course, COS, & Other Stories, they have the same -- more or less, the same business idea, which is fashion quality at best price in a sustainable way, but of course, in a higher price level -- price range. So that means that price baskets typically should be higher.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chris Chaviaras (Analysts)】\nOkay. But I guess volume should be lower. So would you say that sort of at least the value of the basket will be higher than H&M?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nWell, that's just what I said, the value per basket per -- yes, it should be higher, absolutely.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jamie Merriman (Analysts)】\nYou talked about the strong reception from your e-commerce offers as you've launched them in new markets. And I'm just wondering, has those launches caused you to reconsider your store expansion plans at all, either reducing the number of stores that you're opening or changing the kind of store, maybe not opening as many small stores and focusing more on flagship stores?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nIt's true that e-commerce is growing, but we see potential to continue to grow both in the physical stores and at the same time, on the e-commerce. So we think that, that can be the situation for many years to come. But we have a lot of the expansion still in existing markets and on new markets when it comes to physical stores. So we are doing them both and seeing huge potential in both channels.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jamie Merriman (Analysts)】\nOkay. And so no type even to the -- no change even to the type of store that you open given e-commerce growth?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nNo. We're -- on the opposite, sometimes, we are looking into broadening our offer -- existing offers in both channels, both in the e-commerce channel but also in physical stores. We have added H&M Sport, extended shoes. Now we are launching the beauty line, so we have also extended existing store space if it's possible.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Dana Telsey (Analysts)】\nCan you please give a little bit of an update on omni-channel initiatives, where you stand there? And then as you open more H&Ms globally, how do you think of backfilling in with secondary concepts in the different markets?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nRight. Regarding omni channel, I think we've touched upon this before. We are investing a lot, and we are adding and improving. And as well -- at the same time as we are expanding into new markets, we are also improving the customer offering online, customer experience, and we've had, for example, return in store in many countries now. We have the scan-and-buy function in many countries. We have the loyalty scheme. We have broadened the assortments, et cetera, et cetera. So a lot of things going on and a lot of things happening. Regarding your other question, we are launching the other brands, expanding them at a faster speed in percentage than H&M. It's primarily COS, & Other Stories this year, but we are also looking to speed up Monki going forward and Weekday. And as you know, we have launched COS, & Other Stories in the U.S., and we are very happy with that. And of course, this year, as I mentioned, there would be at least 4 new markets for COS, and we're very excited about that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Adam Cochrane (Analysts)】\nI'm going to try a slightly different concept. Maybe I'll ask 2 questions, and then you can choose which one you answer. Firstly, I noticed that in Russia, you increased some of your prices. Was that following on from seeing competitors increase their prices largely due to the FX issues? That's the first one. And then secondly, you just mentioned, following on from that last question, about the growth in the other concept. What proportion of sales is coming through the H&M brand now? And of the stores opening this year, how many of them are H&M compared to the other concepts, please?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nStarting with Russia. I mean, the whole market has increased or adjusted prices through the collapse of the ruble. So of course, we continuously monitor pricing and competitors and sourcing and some natural parts. So that's nothing new. That happens all the time, not just when currencies move as quickly as they've done at the moment. So nothing new about that. And regarding the other question, there is -- I think in the report, we state how many stores -- we break it down per brand, and that gives you an idea about the expansion. And I don't see any dramatic changes going forward.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Adam Cochrane (Analysts)】\nOkay. At what stage -- roughly what percentage of sales would they contribute to the group now?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nThe vast majority of the sales is, of course, H&M. But we are very happy with the other brands, and they are -- we're seeing great potential for each of them.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rebecca McClellan (Analysts)】\nIt's Rebecca again. I was just wondering whether you could quantify what you mean by very negative in terms of the impact of the external factors on purchasing [ph] costs in terms of what we might expect for the gross margin in the second half and into 2016.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nAgain, let me remind you that we will not give any guidance on gross margin. This is a very, as you know, very competitive industry, and there is no pattern or anything that we can give. So this is something we keep to ourselves. And for us, it's always about having the best customer offering, and the gross margin is a result of that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rebecca McClellan (Analysts)】\nOkay. And secondly, would you expect a higher volume of garments into the sort of summer sales given sort of levels of inventory at the end of the second quarter?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nAs we said, the stock-in-trade level is on a good level at the end of Q2. And what the reduction levels will be when ending Q3, we have to come back to because it's still over 2 months to go. So that we will come back to in connection with Q3 report.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nBut you're asking about the quantity, right?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rebecca McClellan (Analysts)】\nYes, the volume of products for the end-of-season sale -- summer sale.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nWe don't break that out, sorry.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Fraser Ramzan (Analysts)】\nJust wanted to ask about the inventory position. If we take the local currency sales increase of 27%, I think you said that a big piece comes from, obviously, expansion and also inventory for new online markets. But also a big piece is clearly the U.S. dollar. Given your sort of speed of inventory turn, isn't it sensible to think that the bit that relates to the U.S. dollar is really what's going to impact your P&L in the next quarter?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nYes, of course. What's in the stock-in-trade in Q2, so of course, that will come through the P&L when we are selling the garments. So you will see the effect in Q3. That's true.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Fraser Ramzan (Analysts)】\nRight. So if I've got 27% local currency inventory increase, and this is my analysis and obviously not your guidance, I understand that. If, let's say, 15% of that relates to expansion and some of your new online markets, then we would be looking at a 12% cost headwind in the P&L in the coming quarter. Obviously, all else equal, which it never is, obviously prices move and that kind of thing, but is that a fair way to think about the inventory number we're looking at?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nAs we have many times said, we won't -- we don't want to elaborate and go into more details when it comes to how the composition and what's exactly the impact from different factors, but we are happy with the level and the composition. And there is a huge U.S. dollar impact on the stock-in-trade, and that will, of course, be released through the P&L during the next -- or the Q3.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charlie Muir-Sands (Analysts)】\nOn the newswires this morning, there was a comment that you guys are looking at maybe launching another new banner in 2017. Could you elaborate on what was said this morning? And also, on the existing other banners, can you confirm that returns are similar to the rollout of H&M concept?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nAgain, 1 question at a time. The first rumor you referred to was a comment the CEO made this morning regarding our new business department that are looking into new things all the time, and yes, there are some concrete things that we are looking into. But I don't think he mentioned 2017. He said going forward.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charlie Muir-Sands (Analysts)】\nOkay, yes, sorry. So the second question was, so for the rollout of the other concepts, & Other Stories and COS, can you confirm that the margins -- return on capital profile or however you appraise the economics for those is comparable to the rollout of the H&M concepts?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nWell, we don't -- we should not -- we choose not to comment profitability per concept, brand or market. And of course, initially when you launch a brand, there's a lot of costs connected to that and margins are not where we want them to be in the long term, of course. But I mean, we see great opportunities for -- and potential for all of the brands. But more than that, we don't want to comment the profitability.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Steegers (Analysts)】\nJust back to the gross margin, maybe trying to slice it one other way and get a bit more information. Was there any hedging benefit in the gross margin move in the second quarter? And given you've got reasonably short hedging period, would it be fair to assume then through Q3 and Q4, you should at the end of Q4, broadly have annualized the current euro, dollar or -- dollar, SEK rate? Or would you be still expecting a further gross margin impact next year, all else being equal?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nThe first question regarding hedging gains, could you specify?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Steegers (Analysts)】\nWell, I'm just wondering if there was still -- you still have some hedges which are rolling off in the second quarter that would have benefited at all your inventory or your COGS and protected you in terms of the gross margin, obviously. Has that been rolled out -- or rolled off, you don't have that positive impact in Q3, Q4? I'm just trying to get a sense of when this whole -- the fall in the euro -- Swedish krona relative to the dollar will fully annualize in your gross margins.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nOf course, there's always a mix of inventories going from Q2 to Q3, et cetera, but the negative impact from the U.S. dollar in Q3 and Q4 is much more negative than for those garments that we bought for Q2. And when it comes to Q1 next year, 2016, we haven't started to buy the products at this stage. But if the U.S. dollar will be on this level, it most probably will cause a headwind when it comes to negative impact on our purchasing prices also for Q1.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Richard Jaffe (Analysts)】\nTwo questions, again, one at a time. Could you talk about the pervasiveness of the loyalty program, how well it's been adopted, how many more markets can it be rolled out and perhaps how large it is, either qualitatively or quantitatively? And then if you could talk briefly about the Southern Hemisphere and some of the unique challenges you've been able to overcome in expanding down there.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nOkay. First question regarding loyalty scheme, as I said, we launched it -- we started to launch it end of last year. And it was -- so far, we only have it in 2 markets, this new version of loyalty scheme, and we are very happy so far. But I don't -- I can't give you any more details at this moment going forward. But of course, this is something we believe a lot in, and we want to roll out. The plan is to roll it out in the rest of the group, okay? And the next question was regarding Southern Hemisphere. And we have now a strong beachhead into Southern Hemisphere. We have stores, as you know, in South America, Australia, and we're very excited about the launch coming up in South Africa. And so we see a -- we have now a process how to handle the reverse seasonality, and obviously, it works well. So now it's just to scale it up.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Stefan Billing (Analysts)】\nOn the gross margin, could you please quantify what very negative means versus just negative?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nA lot of questions regarding gross margin. Again, we won't be able to give you any more flavor than what we have said already, I'm sorry.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nOkay. If there are no more questions, I'd like to thank you, all, very much for participating in this conference call. And we'll come back for the third quarter results on the 24th of September. Goodbye.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to this conference call. I'm joined on the call by Ian Kirk, the Sanlam Deputy CEO; our financial director, Kobus Möller; and Wikus Olivier, the Head of Group Finance. Let me give you a brief overview of the results for the first 4 months.\r\nDetails of the group's performance for this period, the first 4 months of 2015, are included in the sales announcement released earlier today. I would like to highlight a few aspects before we proceed to questions.\r\nFirstly, as anticipated, operating conditions in 2015 are not conducive to very strong growth. Economic growth in disposable income levels in South Africa, in particular, remain under pressure, with electricity supply constraints also weighing heavily on consumer sentiment. As highlighted in the update, a number of African economies and also India are facing some headwinds, with India lagging in terms of infrastructure investment and a whole range of policy reforms. Despite these difficult conditions, we were able to deliver a satisfactory underlying growth in most of the group businesses, of course assisted by our diversified strategy across geographies, distribution channels and product solutions.\r\nSome of the salient features of the performance that I would like to highlight, some of the big issues for us, new business volumes increased by 15%, net fund flows up some 30%, if you exclude the ZAR 9 billion pullout withdrawal by the Botswana Public Officers Pension Fund. So in spite of that, I think a good underlying growth. Our value of new business up by 8%. And our net operating earnings, that increased by 8%. From a new business perspective, overall growth at the group level was in line with our medium- to longer-term target, with the South African businesses compensating for a few challenges that we've experienced in emerging markets, unlike in the past. The recovery in Sanlam Sky's performance was particularly pleasing.\r\nEmerging markets had a difficult 4 months, impacted by a number of issues: firstly, lower unit trust sales in Namibia; secondly, a slow start in the Malaysian general insurance business, Pacific and Orient; thirdly, instability in the rest of Africa distribution to a number of problems we experienced with the implementation of new life administration systems; and fourthly, some of these challenges are internal and have largely been addressed. I think -- but for the 4 months, the results were, we think, suboptimal. We are therefore confident of an improved performance in the remainder of the year and looking forward.\r\nI also would like to stress that growth in operating earnings was lower than that achieved for the last 2 years. As mentioned in our results announcement, the 2014 financial year was particularly strong for the group, with both underwriting conditions and investment markets being exceptionally favorable. Now of course, this set a very high base for 2015, which was further impacted in the first 4 months of the year by a number of issues. I think, firstly, a normalization in Santam's claims experience. Secondly, lower performance fees at Sanlam Investments, and I'd like to point out that performance fees are volatile in nature over the shorter term. We did communicate that we lost a big mandate from the PIC, and last year, we did do particularly well on -- in performance fees on that. This year, we simply didn't have the money.\r\nWe also have invested for future growth at Sanlam Investments, with the business incurring additional expenditure on marketing, expanding capacity in its client-facing distribution units, and we're also at collective investments outsourcing the administration function. Some operating earnings dilution after the effect of exchanging of a 2% direct interest in Shriram Transport Finance Company, which we had in last year. And this year, we had an increased stake in Shriram Group at the holding level in there. And we've also had a particular issue in Shriram Transport Finance Company in India, where a small subsidiary had a negative bad debt experience. These were all particular instances of headwinds that we've encountered.\r\nIn conclusion, I'd like to say 1 or 2 things. Looking ahead to the remainder of the year, we expect the challenging environment to persist. We don't expect a miraculous improvement. So combined with a high operating earnings base of 2014, the growth in this metric will remain muted for the remainder of the year. Our medium- and long-term growth targets have remained intact, and we are confident that we will continue to deliver substantial value to our shareholders.\r\nAt this stage, I'd like to say thank you, and I will now open the call for questions from the audience.",

      "transcript_text3": "I just wanted to ask the decline in the distributable capital or free surplus or whatever you want to call it, does that include allowance for investing further in India?\n\n---\n\nYes, Risto, thank you. There are 2 or 3 deals that we've announced, and if we kept the money there -- the money that has not been invested yet is around ZAR 4 billion. And we have quite a few deals that we've announced. The one is the Medscheme deal of around ZAR 700 million. We have the investment into India. We've announced a transaction into Zimbabwe and 1 or 2 smaller ones. And where we've already committed the money, we've simply taken that off, and that accounts for the decline.\n\n---\n\nThat includes India?\n\n---\n\nThat includes India.\n\n---\n\nYes, can you maybe give us a small indication of what the India number is?\n\n---\n\nThe India number has not been finalized yet. We're in negotiations. We're going to -- we're working with a range at this moment in time, and it is well within what we've communicated.\n\n---\n\nQuick question on the Rest of Africa. If you exclude Namibia and Botswana from your volume numbers, [indiscernible] growth over the last couple of years, you did comment on the impact of currency. Can you tell us what the growth was in constant currency for the Rest of Africa please?\n\n---\n\nWe haven't disclosed that number, Larissa. But I think for -- in the year, I mean, the rand actually appreciated relative to the Rest of Africa [indiscernible], so it had a slightly negative effect for the 4 months.\n\n---\n\nJust south of 10%.\n\n---\n\nIt's not that material.\n\n---\n\nYes. But in the comments that we've made, we've had an issue in 1 or 2 countries: Kenya, Zambia and so forth, with systems. And apart from those hiccups, I think everything is on [indiscernible].\n\n---\n\nAnd so can we assume that the trends from the last few years we expect to continue, all else being equal, nothing to disrupt the restructuring at this point?\n\n---\n\nI think the economic environment is something that you should take into account. I think we do see, particularly in those commodity-based economies, that there is certainly level off of lower growth in those countries, so -- which -- and they all come through in our results.\n\n---\n\nYes, if you really take into account our client base in many of these countries, it is essentially, I don't want to say by and large, but a big chunk of it is the civil service. And the moment you have the -- these commodity-based economies under pressure, people don't get the same kind of increases, and therefore, you're unlikely to grow. And I think for the first year in 20 years, Africa as a whole will probably have a flat growth rate after the past 10 years, having had substantial economic growth. And this all plays into things. Once you've accounted for that, I think we do pretty well.\n\n---\n\nJust on the currency, we also see an impact that you take into account where most of those currency depreciated sharply against the dollar. And a lot those economies are actually reliant on dollars in terms of the...\n\n---\n\nOpposed to the rand?\n\n---\n\nYes. And so that's the impact to look at. First [ph] the rand, local currency is just the conversion rate that has impact. But for them, it's actually the dollar.\n\n---\n\nOkay. At the moment, in the Rest of Africa, would you say that the economic situation or the lack of the penetration is the bigger driver of growth?\n\n---\n\nI would think a big driver has always been the low penetration rate. And that's helped us. It also helps to keep the -- there -- because there isn't much competition, you get the kind of margin that we do get. And we think a lot of the underlying trends that we've seen in the past are still there, except that economy-wise, we have a bit of a headwind.\n\n---\n\nI just want to -- so I just want to just confirm that you guys don't have any -- with the -- I guess the -- what happened at the Shriram Transport. You don't have any -- what is your feeling about how they're going to perform for the rest of the year?\n\n---\n\nI think we're going to perform fairly well. Listen, what has happened there is -- was fairly unexpected than you would have seen. A very small subsidiary, it is miniscule in terms of the size of the book, underperformed. And these people are extremely prudent, and simply assume that none of the money there will be recoverable. It is -- and I think subsequently to that, it shows that they were fairly prudent. In the next month or 2, we'll get the real picture. You know that we don't want to make all sorts of pronouncements now. But my only expectation certainly is that they've been much too prudent to simply assume that nothing will be recoverable and that sort of thing. The machines are all there. It's a small company called Shriram Equipment Finance. The machines are still there. They're not worthless, if everything goes badly. We've written off these loans, but we still have the machines, and certainly, they have value. And yes, I think they've been very prudent in the way that they've addressed the issue but maybe have gone a bit overboard.\n\n---\n\nUnderlying business is actually doing reasonably well. The normal commercial truck business is doing well. This is a small subsidiary. As Johan indicated, it's [indiscernible] equipment, 80%. And we -- our people say, come July, we'll know where we stand on that one. So we'll be able to give a report back with our interim results.\n\n---\n\nTwo quick questions. The first is the special dividend out of MCIS that you allude to. Could you give us an indication of its size in relation to how much you paid for that asset? So that's the first question. And then the second question relates to the deteriorating trends in persistency that you mentioned. Is that in relation to the middle market in particular? Could you elaborate on what you're referring to there?\n\n---\n\nYes. I think the special dividend -- as you know, we've had a lot of surplus capital, and we still have a lot of surplus capital in MCIS. And I've said one of the key things that we would like to do is create the -- through a series of special dividends, get that lower. We have to work with a regulator on that. He's of the view that we should take more time to do it. But we got a fair amount of the money out.\n\n---\n\nIt's around 10% of the investment.\n\n---\n\nAround 10% of the investment. But we're not where we would like to be. There is more to come over time. But it's also we have to build a relationship with regulators. You don't simply buy a business and strip all the surplus capital out in the first day that you're there, and this is -- so it's part of a process.\n\n---\n\nOn the second question, persistency.\n\n---\n\nOn the persistency -- Ian can also come in on this. But we've seen deterioration essentially across-the-board, and it has to do with the pressure that we see in this country that people are under. And in fact, it's still within the -- well within the assumptions that we have. But we have to warn you and we said so at -- in the outset that the consumer is under pressure. We've been monitoring this very carefully. And there has been, across-the-board, a sort of deterioration.\n\n---\n\nYes, it's not a huge thing. We're watching it carefully. And in the Sky business, there's probably some internal factors, not the administration or that sort of stuff, but the volume, the [indiscernible] order versus the stop [ph] order volumes have had a bit of an impact, so we have to trade through that. But we're just signaling that it's not that easy there. And we're a bit anxious about it. We have to manage a bit tighter, but we have a good handle.\n\n---\n\nAs you know, we have a good handle on persistency, and a lot of it also has to do with what kind of business we have. Maybe we'll have to make the hurdle a bit higher. But we still have to write business. I think we can't make it so high that we don't write any business, write one policy and maybe keep 100% of it.\n\n---\n\nIn the past, I think, or last time you told us the value of new business was at the corresponding period or at the previous year-end economic assumptions, was -- did you use FY '14 year-end economic assumptions? In other words, interest rates, or did you use the 30th of April interest rates for that value of new business growth number of 8%?\n\n---\n\nWe've used the 30th of April number, but it is -- the differences are marginal, really. I mean it's very similar, through end of December, sorry.\n\n---\n\nSo you had to use end of December number?\n\n---\n\nNo, no, no, we've used the end of -- we've had to use the end of April number, but the difference to the end of December is marginal.\n\n---\n\nOkay. The agency volumes in the entry-level market, that was strong. I would have expected that the group numbers would be strong with ZCC renewal that took place in the period. But it seems like the group volumes were actually down. Can you also just talk about the differences in margins between the agency volumes and the group volumes and why the agency volume's specifically up so strongly, given that, I think, your peers aren't seeing growth in the entry level market volumes at the moment compared to last year?\n\n---\n\nStrike, strike, there was a strike.\n\n---\n\nYes, last year, we had the strike, and this -- which, put our margins under a bit of pressure. And this year, it's been a bit better on the retail side, in particular. So we've done pretty well.\n\n---\n\nPart of the volume growth is because we -- the low base after the strike. On the group business, obviously, we've lost the Capitec business, which was in the -- so that had impact. And a big part of the ZCC renewal actually comes through in May only. And so that's also why you don't see it yet in those numbers.\n\n---\n\nOkay. But the ZCC renewal will be positive coming through in the future?\n\n---\n\nYes. In the first 6 months, you will see it, but not in the 4 months.\n\n---\n\nYes. On that, it is likely to be less. In the past, it was always a big number, but we've changed things a little bit. And it's likely to be, I think -- the effect of the increase will be a bit smaller. It's positive, but it's a smaller positive than in the past.\n\n---\n\nThe Glacier volumes that -- I think in FY '14 was also up 30%, now up another 29%. Can you give an idea of how much of that is life insurance and how much of that is investment business? I think in the past it was roughly 50-50. Is that still the case? And also maybe just speak to the difference in new business margins for the last component versus the rest of the individual life single premiums.\n\n---\n\nYes. I think the margin is -- Kobus, you...\n\n---\n\nYes. Just your question -- maybe to start with your question on the volumes. I think it's -- the growth is nearly similar...\n\n---\n\n[indiscernible] with Glacier growing very quickly, and the middle market, I think, shrunk new business volumes. So if you can just give an indication of how the margins on Glacier compares with your middle market single premium margins.\n\n---\n\nIt's a little bit lower, if you write it in on the Glacier platform. But it's -- I mean, there's no single premiums. The margin itself is really low. So it's not that material in the overall SDF cluster. For the SDF cluster, the margins are actually marginally up on last year, this time.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then how much of the Glacier volumes are now...\n\n---\n\nThat's -- it's fairly similar to what we've seen last year, sort of 50-50.\n\n---\n\nMaybe just one comment to make. I think in -- we've seen very strong growth in large business in Glacier and not so much in the middle market. And I think this part of the business has actually moved to Glacier. So I want you to actually look at the 2 in combination to get a better feel for the sale of our life single premium business.\n\n---\n\nBut in Glacier, the value of new business grew quite substantially.\n\n---\n\nVery quick follow-up on one of Brian's questions. On the special dividend on MCIS, when you [indiscernible] last year, [indiscernible] of the Shriram subsidiary because you had Pacific and Orient. Have you done that yet?\n\n---\n\nWell, it has been done. But we don't pay for that. So it was never part of our acquisition, so it was actually ring-fenced at the time. The asset and the proceeds of the asset was ring-fenced. So we -- but it has been done.\n\n---\n\nThat's been done. It's out of the business now. And the held back the disposal of that, held back some of the restructuring that we could do. So effectively, we've only been running that business the way we want to and on the road we would like to run it for the past sort of 2 months. And the first thing we did was try and get a special dividend out. So there's a whole range of plans and so forth. I'm very happy to report that the while growth last year in MCIS has been under pressure, I mean we've taken some steps, and it is doing fairly well now, certainly meeting our expectations.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And so the special dividend was not driven by -- was not a result of selling the second [indiscernible] actually a business decision on excess capital?\n\n---\n\nNo, no, no. Nothing was to do with it.\n\n---\n\nThe timing might be linked, but not the amount.\n\n---\n\nNot the reason.\n\n---\n\nYes. Just I'd like to thank you, all the participants, for participating. We look forward to speaking to you again at our interim's result announcement in September, and good luck. Thank you so much.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Risto Ketola (Analysts)】\nI just wanted to ask the decline in the distributable capital or free surplus or whatever you want to call it, does that include allowance for investing further in India?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Johan van Zyl (Executives)】\nYes, Risto, thank you. There are 2 or 3 deals that we've announced, and if we kept the money there -- the money that has not been invested yet is around ZAR 4 billion. And we have quite a few deals that we've announced. The one is the Medscheme deal of around ZAR 700 million. We have the investment into India. We've announced a transaction into Zimbabwe and 1 or 2 smaller ones. And where we've already committed the money, we've simply taken that off, and that accounts for the decline.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Risto Ketola (Analysts)】\nThat includes India?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Johan van Zyl (Executives)】\nThat includes India.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Risto Ketola (Analysts)】\nYes, can you maybe give us a small indication of what the India number is?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Johan van Zyl (Executives)】\nThe India number has not been finalized yet. We're in negotiations. We're going to -- we're working with a range at this moment in time, and it is well within what we've communicated.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Larissa van Deventer (Analysts)】\nQuick question on the Rest of Africa. If you exclude Namibia and Botswana from your volume numbers, [indiscernible] growth over the last couple of years, you did comment on the impact of currency. Can you tell us what the growth was in constant currency for the Rest of Africa please?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kobus Möller (Executives)】\nWe haven't disclosed that number, Larissa. But I think for -- in the year, I mean, the rand actually appreciated relative to the Rest of Africa [indiscernible], so it had a slightly negative effect for the 4 months.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Johan van Zyl (Executives)】\nJust south of 10%.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kobus Möller (Executives)】\nIt's not that material.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Johan van Zyl (Executives)】\nYes. But in the comments that we've made, we've had an issue in 1 or 2 countries: Kenya, Zambia and so forth, with systems. And apart from those hiccups, I think everything is on [indiscernible].\n\n---\n\n【質問: Larissa van Deventer (Analysts)】\nAnd so can we assume that the trends from the last few years we expect to continue, all else being equal, nothing to disrupt the restructuring at this point?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kobus Möller (Executives)】\nI think the economic environment is something that you should take into account. I think we do see, particularly in those commodity-based economies, that there is certainly level off of lower growth in those countries, so -- which -- and they all come through in our results.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Johan van Zyl (Executives)】\nYes, if you really take into account our client base in many of these countries, it is essentially, I don't want to say by and large, but a big chunk of it is the civil service. And the moment you have the -- these commodity-based economies under pressure, people don't get the same kind of increases, and therefore, you're unlikely to grow. And I think for the first year in 20 years, Africa as a whole will probably have a flat growth rate after the past 10 years, having had substantial economic growth. And this all plays into things. Once you've accounted for that, I think we do pretty well.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kobus Möller (Executives)】\nJust on the currency, we also see an impact that you take into account where most of those currency depreciated sharply against the dollar. And a lot those economies are actually reliant on dollars in terms of the...\n\n---\n\n【質問: Larissa van Deventer (Analysts)】\nOpposed to the rand?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kobus Möller (Executives)】\nYes. And so that's the impact to look at. First [ph] the rand, local currency is just the conversion rate that has impact. But for them, it's actually the dollar.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Larissa van Deventer (Analysts)】\nOkay. At the moment, in the Rest of Africa, would you say that the economic situation or the lack of the penetration is the bigger driver of growth?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Johan van Zyl (Executives)】\nI would think a big driver has always been the low penetration rate. And that's helped us. It also helps to keep the -- there -- because there isn't much competition, you get the kind of margin that we do get. And we think a lot of the underlying trends that we've seen in the past are still there, except that economy-wise, we have a bit of a headwind.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\nI just want to -- so I just want to just confirm that you guys don't have any -- with the -- I guess the -- what happened at the Shriram Transport. You don't have any -- what is your feeling about how they're going to perform for the rest of the year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Johan van Zyl (Executives)】\nI think we're going to perform fairly well. Listen, what has happened there is -- was fairly unexpected than you would have seen. A very small subsidiary, it is miniscule in terms of the size of the book, underperformed. And these people are extremely prudent, and simply assume that none of the money there will be recoverable. It is -- and I think subsequently to that, it shows that they were fairly prudent. In the next month or 2, we'll get the real picture. You know that we don't want to make all sorts of pronouncements now. But my only expectation certainly is that they've been much too prudent to simply assume that nothing will be recoverable and that sort of thing. The machines are all there. It's a small company called Shriram Equipment Finance. The machines are still there. They're not worthless, if everything goes badly. We've written off these loans, but we still have the machines, and certainly, they have value. And yes, I think they've been very prudent in the way that they've addressed the issue but maybe have gone a bit overboard.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ian Kirk (Executives)】\nUnderlying business is actually doing reasonably well. The normal commercial truck business is doing well. This is a small subsidiary. As Johan indicated, it's [indiscernible] equipment, 80%. And we -- our people say, come July, we'll know where we stand on that one. So we'll be able to give a report back with our interim results.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Brian Mushonga (Analysts)】\nTwo quick questions. The first is the special dividend out of MCIS that you allude to. Could you give us an indication of its size in relation to how much you paid for that asset? So that's the first question. And then the second question relates to the deteriorating trends in persistency that you mentioned. Is that in relation to the middle market in particular? Could you elaborate on what you're referring to there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Johan van Zyl (Executives)】\nYes. I think the special dividend -- as you know, we've had a lot of surplus capital, and we still have a lot of surplus capital in MCIS. And I've said one of the key things that we would like to do is create the -- through a series of special dividends, get that lower. We have to work with a regulator on that. He's of the view that we should take more time to do it. But we got a fair amount of the money out.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kobus Möller (Executives)】\nIt's around 10% of the investment.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Johan van Zyl (Executives)】\nAround 10% of the investment. But we're not where we would like to be. There is more to come over time. But it's also we have to build a relationship with regulators. You don't simply buy a business and strip all the surplus capital out in the first day that you're there, and this is -- so it's part of a process.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Brian Mushonga (Analysts)】\nOn the second question, persistency.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Johan van Zyl (Executives)】\nOn the persistency -- Ian can also come in on this. But we've seen deterioration essentially across-the-board, and it has to do with the pressure that we see in this country that people are under. And in fact, it's still within the -- well within the assumptions that we have. But we have to warn you and we said so at -- in the outset that the consumer is under pressure. We've been monitoring this very carefully. And there has been, across-the-board, a sort of deterioration.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ian Kirk (Executives)】\nYes, it's not a huge thing. We're watching it carefully. And in the Sky business, there's probably some internal factors, not the administration or that sort of stuff, but the volume, the [indiscernible] order versus the stop [ph] order volumes have had a bit of an impact, so we have to trade through that. But we're just signaling that it's not that easy there. And we're a bit anxious about it. We have to manage a bit tighter, but we have a good handle.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Johan van Zyl (Executives)】\nAs you know, we have a good handle on persistency, and a lot of it also has to do with what kind of business we have. Maybe we'll have to make the hurdle a bit higher. But we still have to write business. I think we can't make it so high that we don't write any business, write one policy and maybe keep 100% of it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Francois Du Toit (Analysts)】\nIn the past, I think, or last time you told us the value of new business was at the corresponding period or at the previous year-end economic assumptions, was -- did you use FY '14 year-end economic assumptions? In other words, interest rates, or did you use the 30th of April interest rates for that value of new business growth number of 8%?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Johan van Zyl (Executives)】\nWe've used the 30th of April number, but it is -- the differences are marginal, really. I mean it's very similar, through end of December, sorry.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Francois Du Toit (Analysts)】\nSo you had to use end of December number?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Johan van Zyl (Executives)】\nNo, no, no, we've used the end of -- we've had to use the end of April number, but the difference to the end of December is marginal.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Francois Du Toit (Analysts)】\nOkay. The agency volumes in the entry-level market, that was strong. I would have expected that the group numbers would be strong with ZCC renewal that took place in the period. But it seems like the group volumes were actually down. Can you also just talk about the differences in margins between the agency volumes and the group volumes and why the agency volume's specifically up so strongly, given that, I think, your peers aren't seeing growth in the entry level market volumes at the moment compared to last year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nStrike, strike, there was a strike.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Johan van Zyl (Executives)】\nYes, last year, we had the strike, and this -- which, put our margins under a bit of pressure. And this year, it's been a bit better on the retail side, in particular. So we've done pretty well.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kobus Möller (Executives)】\nPart of the volume growth is because we -- the low base after the strike. On the group business, obviously, we've lost the Capitec business, which was in the -- so that had impact. And a big part of the ZCC renewal actually comes through in May only. And so that's also why you don't see it yet in those numbers.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Francois Du Toit (Analysts)】\nOkay. But the ZCC renewal will be positive coming through in the future?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ian Kirk (Executives)】\nYes. In the first 6 months, you will see it, but not in the 4 months.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Johan van Zyl (Executives)】\nYes. On that, it is likely to be less. In the past, it was always a big number, but we've changed things a little bit. And it's likely to be, I think -- the effect of the increase will be a bit smaller. It's positive, but it's a smaller positive than in the past.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Francois Du Toit (Analysts)】\nThe Glacier volumes that -- I think in FY '14 was also up 30%, now up another 29%. Can you give an idea of how much of that is life insurance and how much of that is investment business? I think in the past it was roughly 50-50. Is that still the case? And also maybe just speak to the difference in new business margins for the last component versus the rest of the individual life single premiums.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nYes. I think the margin is -- Kobus, you...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kobus Möller (Executives)】\nYes. Just your question -- maybe to start with your question on the volumes. I think it's -- the growth is nearly similar...\n\n---\n\n【質問: Francois Du Toit (Analysts)】\n[indiscernible] with Glacier growing very quickly, and the middle market, I think, shrunk new business volumes. So if you can just give an indication of how the margins on Glacier compares with your middle market single premium margins.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Johan van Zyl (Executives)】\nIt's a little bit lower, if you write it in on the Glacier platform. But it's -- I mean, there's no single premiums. The margin itself is really low. So it's not that material in the overall SDF cluster. For the SDF cluster, the margins are actually marginally up on last year, this time.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Francois Du Toit (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then how much of the Glacier volumes are now...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Johan van Zyl (Executives)】\nThat's -- it's fairly similar to what we've seen last year, sort of 50-50.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kobus Möller (Executives)】\nMaybe just one comment to make. I think in -- we've seen very strong growth in large business in Glacier and not so much in the middle market. And I think this part of the business has actually moved to Glacier. So I want you to actually look at the 2 in combination to get a better feel for the sale of our life single premium business.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nBut in Glacier, the value of new business grew quite substantially.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Larissa van Deventer (Analysts)】\nVery quick follow-up on one of Brian's questions. On the special dividend on MCIS, when you [indiscernible] last year, [indiscernible] of the Shriram subsidiary because you had Pacific and Orient. Have you done that yet?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kobus Möller (Executives)】\nWell, it has been done. But we don't pay for that. So it was never part of our acquisition, so it was actually ring-fenced at the time. The asset and the proceeds of the asset was ring-fenced. So we -- but it has been done.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Johan van Zyl (Executives)】\nThat's been done. It's out of the business now. And the held back the disposal of that, held back some of the restructuring that we could do. So effectively, we've only been running that business the way we want to and on the road we would like to run it for the past sort of 2 months. And the first thing we did was try and get a special dividend out. So there's a whole range of plans and so forth. I'm very happy to report that the while growth last year in MCIS has been under pressure, I mean we've taken some steps, and it is doing fairly well now, certainly meeting our expectations.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Francois Du Toit (Analysts)】\nOkay. And so the special dividend was not driven by -- was not a result of selling the second [indiscernible] actually a business decision on excess capital?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Johan van Zyl (Executives)】\nNo, no, no. Nothing was to do with it.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kobus Möller (Executives)】\nThe timing might be linked, but not the amount.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Francois Du Toit (Analysts)】\nNot the reason.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Johan van Zyl (Executives)】\nYes. Just I'd like to thank you, all the participants, for participating. We look forward to speaking to you again at our interim's result announcement in September, and good luck. Thank you so much.",

      "transcript_text1": "Okay. Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. I will briefly go over sales and store growth highlights of the first quarter before turning it over to Michael, who will provide you with more detailed update on our financial results and key operating initiatives.\r\nIn this quarter, sales increased by 13% as a result of continued expansion of our store network and strong organic sales growth. During the quarter, we opened 17 net new stores compared to 25 net new stores opened in Q1 last year. Our total store count across Canada is now 972 stores compared with 899 stores at the end of May 4, 2014. Our fiscal 2016 -- for fiscal 2016, we expect to open between 70 and 80 net new stores, with these new stores being opened throughout Canada. We expect to open our 1,000th store at the beginning of Q3, marking a nice milestone on Dollarama's history.\r\nIn this quarter, we also achieved a 6.9% increase in same-store sales through an increase in average basket size and an increase in the number of transactions. EBITDA grew 22.9% this quarter, which is attributable to strong sales and margins, general and administrative costs that benefited from the scaling impact of sales and our continued focus on the operational efficiencies. \r\nFrom a merchandising point of view, the summer sales season kicked off quite strong, and our customers are responding positively to our merchandise mix.  Our goal is always to make sure that our customers leave our stores happy to have purchased interesting merchandise at compelling value. As such, we strive to complement our broad selection of everyday items with exciting new seasonal products at great prices, and we believe that the summer selection meets this goal.\r\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Michael for his comments.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Thank you, Larry, and good morning, everyone. During the first quarter, we increased our sales by 13% to $566.1 million from $501.1 million in the prior year. The increase in sales was fueled by the opening of 73 net new stores over the past 12 months and a same-store sales increase of 6.9% during the quarter. The same-store sales growth consisted of a 5.9% increase in basket size, which reflects the consumer demand for our higher-price-point items, and a 1% increase in the number of transactions, driven by higher traffic in our stores. \r\nIn this quarter, 73% of our sales originated from products priced higher than $1 compared to 62% in the corresponding quarter last year. Debit card penetration also increased as 46% of sales were paid with debit cards compared to 42% in the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year.\r\nIn the first quarter, our gross margin was 36% of sales compared to 35.4% of sales in Q1 last year. This increase is mainly attributable to slightly higher product margins, to the positive scaling impact of strong comparable store sales as well as to lower logistics costs as a percentage of sales as a result of operational improvements. As we have stated in the past, we have been managing our gross margin by continually reinvesting in the value proposition offer to consumers and by refreshing up to 30% of our product offering on a yearly basis. We expect this trend to continue as we target a gross margin for the full fiscal year 2016 in the range of 36% to 37% in order to stimulate continued sales growth.\r\nOur Q1 G&A as a percentage of sales was 17.3% compared to 18.2% last year. This progression is the result of continued improvements in labor productivity achieved through initiatives implemented at the store level. Overall, we still expect a slight improvement in the G&A margin for the full fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal '15 as we target a margin between 16.5% and 17% for fiscal 2016. This margin target is based on expected scaling impacts of sales and continued efficiencies realized through labor productivity.\r\nIn Q1, our EBITDA grew 22.9% to $105.9 million or 18.17% of sales. Our depreciation and amortization expense increased from 1 -- $8.8 million in Q1 last year to $11.2 million this year. Both figures reflect a change in estimates for the useful life of leasehold improvements on store and warehouse equipment affected -- effected in Q1 last year. Q1 net earnings increased to $64.8 million or $0.50 per diluted share compared to $53.2 million or $0.39 per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal 2015.\r\nCash flows from operations decreased to $0.5 million in Q1 from $18.4 million in the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal year. This is due to an increased use of cash to fund working capital, including inventory, and to the timing of payment of normal operating expenses. Inventory is up $40.8 million in the quarter due to the continued growth of store network, a greater proportion of higher-price-point items in the mix and advanced purchases of imported goods made before the elimination of certain general preferential tariffs on January 1, 2015.\r\nWe spent $20 million on capital expenditures in Q1 compared to $19.3 million last year. These expenditures relate primarily to new store openings as well as investments in information technology. In fiscal 2016, we expect to incur capital expenditures in the range of $95 million to $100 million, depending on the number of new stores that we open.\r\nDuring the month of April, we modified our capital structure by issuing additional floating-rate senior unsecured notes in the principal amount of $125 million. Those additional notes constitute an increase to $150 million aggregate principal amount of floating-rate senior unsecured notes issued on May 16, 2014. The net proceeds of the 2015 offering were used to repay indebtedness outstanding under our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes.\r\nNotes were issued at a 0.336% discount, and the offering has allowed us to lock in, for a period of approximately 2 years, a favorable effective interest rate spread of 70 basis points over a 3-month CDOR. Our floating rate notes issued today are treated as single series and bear interest at a rate equal to the applicable 3-month bankers' acceptance rate, plus 54 basis points, reset quarterly and will mature on May 16, 2017.\r\nNow looking at our normal course issuer bid. We repurchased for cancellation, during the quarter, a total of 537,000 shares at an average cost of $66.10 per share for a total cash consideration of $35.5 million. We continue to repurchase shares after the end of Q1 and have now completed the 2014, '15 NCIB program. Therefore, since the launch of the NCIB on June 17, 2014, we have bought back a total of approximately 4.7 million shares, which represents 3.5% of the corporation's total issued and outstanding shares as at June 11, 2014, at a weighted average price of $56.73 per share for a total cash consideration of $265.7 million. This morning, we also announced that we will be renewing our normal course issuer bid, which will allow us to purchase for cancellation of up to 3.5% of issued and outstanding shares at June 9, 2015, or up to 4.5 million shares over the period from June 17, 2015 to June 16, 2016. \r\nFrom an operational perspective now, we have made significant investments in stores over the past few years to continuously improve our operational efficiencies, and we are seeing the results in our SG&A margin that has steadily improved over the years. In-store investments have resulted in improved control over employee time and attendance in the stores, a better assignment of hours through labor scheduling, improved accuracy of inventory replenishment and in-stock inventory positions. These investments have also allowed us to become more efficient by eliminating certain manual tasks. We are now further leveraging these investments to reduce a number of manual daily counts at store level and to fine tune labor scheduling to ensure that we have the right number of people in our stores at all times to offer the best service.\r\nAdditional productivity investments in fiscal '16 will include the rollout of WiFi and complementary technology in all of our stores. For example, adding additional scanning capabilities will help further reduce the time to count inventory for replenishment purposes, improve service at the cash register by reducing wait times and reduce the amount of time needed to perform merchandise changeover from season to season. We expect to see the benefits of these new operational efficiencies next year in fiscal 2017. Overall, we are very pleased with the financial and operating performance of the company this quarter and the continued progress being made on our key initiatives. \r\nThis ends our formal remarks, and we can now take questions. So operator, I'll turn it over to you.",

The increase in sales was fueled by the opening of 73 net new stores over the past 12 months and a same-store sales increase of 6.9% during the quarter. The same-store sales growth consisted of a 5.9% increase in basket size, which reflects the consumer demand for our higher-price-point items, and a 1% increase in the number of transactions, driven by higher traffic in our stores. \r\nIn this quarter, 73% of our sales originated from products priced higher than $1 compared to 62% in the corresponding quarter last year. Debit card penetration also increased as 46% of sales were paid with debit cards compared to 42% in the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year.\r\nIn the first quarter, our gross margin was 36% of sales compared to 35.4% of sales in Q1 last year. This increase is mainly attributable to slightly higher product margins, to the positive scaling impact of strong comparable store sales as well as to lower logistics costs as a percentage of sales as a result of operational improvements. As we have stated in the past, we have been managing our gross margin by continually reinvesting in the value proposition offer to consumers and by refreshing up to 30% of our product offering on a yearly basis. We expect this trend to continue as we target a gross margin for the full fiscal year 2016 in the range of 36% to 37% in order to stimulate continued sales growth.\r\nOur Q1 G&A as a percentage of sales was 17.3% compared to 18.2% last year. This progression is the result of continued improvements in labor productivity achieved through initiatives implemented at the store level. Overall, we still expect a slight improvement in the G&A margin for the full fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal '15 as we target a margin between 16.5% and 17% for fiscal 2016. This margin target is based on expected scaling impacts of sales and continued efficiencies realized through labor productivity.\r\nIn Q1, our EBITDA grew 22.9% to $105.9 million or 18.17% of sales. Our depreciation and amortization expense increased from 1 -- $8.8 million in Q1 last year to $11.2 million this year. Both figures reflect a change in estimates for the useful life of leasehold improvements on store and warehouse equipment affected -- effected in Q1 last year. Q1 net earnings increased to $64.8 million or $0.50 per diluted share compared to $53.2 million or $0.39 per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal 2015.\r\nCash flows from operations decreased to $0.5 million in Q1 from $18.4 million in the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal year. This is due to an increased use of cash to fund working capital, including inventory, and to the timing of payment of normal operating expenses. Inventory is up $40.8 million in the quarter due to the continued growth of store network, a greater proportion of higher-price-point items in the mix and advanced purchases of imported goods made before the elimination of certain general preferential tariffs on January 1, 2015.\r\nWe spent $20 million on capital expenditures in Q1 compared to $19.3 million last year. These expenditures relate primarily to new store openings as well as investments in information technology. In fiscal 2016, we expect to incur capital expenditures in the range of $95 million to $100 million, depending on the number of new stores that we open.\r\nDuring the month of April, we modified our capital structure by issuing additional floating-rate senior unsecured notes in the principal amount of $125 million. Those additional notes constitute an increase to $150 million aggregate principal amount of floating-rate senior unsecured notes issued on May 16, 2014. The net proceeds of the 2015 offering were used to repay indebtedness outstanding under our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes.\r\nNotes were issued at a 0.336% discount, and the offering has allowed us to lock in, for a period of approximately 2 years, a favorable effective interest rate spread of 70 basis points over a 3-month CDOR. Our floating rate notes issued today are treated as single series and bear interest at a rate equal to the applicable 3-month bankers' acceptance rate, plus 54 basis points, reset quarterly and will mature on May 16, 2017.\r\nNow looking at our normal course issuer bid. We repurchased for cancellation, during the quarter, a total of 537,000 shares at an average cost of $66.10 per share for a total cash consideration of $35.5 million. We continue to repurchase shares after the end of Q1 and have now completed the 2014, '15 NCIB program. Therefore, since the launch of the NCIB on June 17, 2014, we have bought back a total of approximately 4.7 million shares, which represents 3.5% of the corporation's total issued and outstanding shares as at June 11, 2014, at a weighted average price of $56.73 per share for a total cash consideration of $265.7 million. This morning, we also announced that we will be renewing our normal course issuer bid, which will allow us to purchase for cancellation of up to 3.5% of issued and outstanding shares at June 9, 2015, or up to 4.5 million shares over the period from June 17, 2015 to June 16, 2016. \r\nFrom an operational perspective now, we have made significant investments in stores over the past few years to continuously improve our operational efficiencies, and we are seeing the results in our SG&A margin that has steadily improved over the years. In-store investments have resulted in improved control over employee time and attendance in the stores, a better assignment of hours through labor scheduling, improved accuracy of inventory replenishment and in-stock inventory positions. These investments have also allowed us to become more efficient by eliminating certain manual tasks. We are now further leveraging these investments to reduce a number of manual daily counts at store level and to fine tune labor scheduling to ensure that we have the right number of people in our stores at all times to offer the best service.\r\nAdditional productivity investments in fiscal '16 will include the rollout of WiFi and complementary technology in all of our stores. For example, adding additional scanning capabilities will help further reduce the time to count inventory for replenishment purposes, improve service at the cash register by reducing wait times and reduce the amount of time needed to perform merchandise changeover from season to season. We expect to see the benefits of these new operational efficiencies next year in fiscal 2017. Overall, we are very pleased with the financial and operating performance of the company this quarter and the continued progress being made on our key initiatives. \r\nThis ends our formal remarks, and we can now take questions. So operator, I'll turn it over to you.",
      "transcript_text3": "We noticed that your higher price point penetration continues to grow. Can you talk about the underlying dynamics? Are you offering more SKUs at higher price points? Or are consumers just buying more of the existing mix of higher-price-point items? Or just talk a little bit about how that penetration is growing.\n\n---\n\nPeter, it's Larry. First of all, good morning. Second of all, I would think -- I don't have the numbers in front of me, but we are -- I would think we are increasing our selection of $3 items, which would result in greater sales of that category. The tendency when you're out there buying is to -- we're not being offered very, very much at $1 price point, especially the $1 price point today would have to absorb the 20%, 25% exchange rate. So we have more potential at the higher price points, I mean, when we talk higher price points, it's all relative, of course, but our higher price points, to give value. And as a result, that's being seen by the public, appreciated by the public, and we're seeing those in the numbers. I don't -- I think I've answered your question, Peter.\n\n---\n\nYes, you have, Larry. And I know people ask you this question often, but what's your thinking about taking things above the high end of the range, above $3?\n\n---\n\nI didn't think that would come so quickly. Well, for this year, we're holding, we're holding. For next year -- we're always thinking about what we have to do to maintain our gross margins, and I'd be a liar to tell you that we're not thinking about it. It's obvious. I think all retailers are looking at their margins very carefully these days, very particularly in Canada and well, around the world, I guess. And we're interested in Canada, and to think that we can absorb 20%, 25% and maintain margins is unrealistic. So we're going to absorb what we can intelligently and then handle the rest as time moves on. So certainly, there's serious thought towards it, but for this year, we're going to maintain as if we're at par, all right, maintain and absorb in a sense. But I feel comfortable in that. We have enough hedging done to make us feel comfortable that we can maintain our retails.\n\n---\n\nI'd like to drill down a little, if I could, on the inventory numbers in the quarter. Michael, you called out sort of the preordering, et cetera, in the quarter. I wonder if you can give us an idea of how much of the inventory increase was on preordering or at least sort of break down some of the inventory bloat for us. And then the follow-on would be just your comfort level or conviction around your inventory productivity as we sort of cycle through the preordering, et cetera, looking through the rest of fiscal '16.\n\n---\n\nYes. Without going into the specifics, everything I mentioned had a significant impact, so preordering, the mix and so the --\n\n---\n\nHigher price point.\n\n---\n\nAnd yes, the higher price point mix and the -- but -- and opportunity buying. So all of that -- it's timing. So that did happen, and I'm not preoccupied. Otherwise, we've got good visibility on our inventory, and so you'll see the inventory levels coming down a bit to the more normal levels that we've been used to in the past.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And then just switching gears very quickly to gross margin performance. Are you able or inclined to share with us the compression -- the FX-driven compression or the sort of FX-driven investment in the proposition? Just trying to sort of tease that out of your gross margin performance.\n\n---\n\nNo. I mean, the margin is doing very well for the factors I mentioned earlier. And I think that what we have to do -- you have to do is come back to what our aim is, and our aim is to keep it within the 36% to 37% range. Right now, it's in the top end of that. And so we -- again, we want to balance the offering that we give versus the return to our shareholder, and so that's as much color as we will give you. Like Larry said, hedging allowed us to absorb definitely a part of the headwind we got from the currency. But we -- and as we said in the past, it's manageable, so it's a clear demonstration of that. But again, if you're looking at the future, we're still looking to keep it within the range I mentioned.\n\n---\n\nJust continuing with the actual sales mix. Larry, you noted that you're seeing better sales of items at $3, that there's a higher penetration of higher-priced items. Can you give us an idea at this point of what the proportion of items sold in the store is at the lower end of the price point versus the higher end of the price range?\n\n---\n\nI think -- Michael, help me out on this. I think, basically, our sales are 70 -- or over 70% over that price point, right?\n\n---\n\nNo -- yes. In sales dollars, it's 73%. But I think Irene's question is try to give more color as to the -- which price points.\n\n---\n\nThat's a moving target, and that's difficult to -- I wouldn't have a clue unless I can get to tomorrow.[ph]\n\n---\n\n.\r\nYes. We prefer not to disclose. Then we'd be disclosing more or less the mix that we'd rather not do.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Well, let me ask -- in the past, okay, in the releases, you -- it said that the majority of items sold are still at $1. I did not see that, so either I missed it or it's not there. Is it, in fact, in there? Or did you take it out?\n\n---\n\nNo, we took it out.\n\n---\n\nOkay. That's very helpful. So that answers the question. And then just coming back to the whole question of SG&A leverage and gross margin. You mentioned the scaling benefit for both of those. So is it fair to say that if we see things -- or sales kind of go more towards that 4% to 5% range or 5% -- in the upper end of that range as opposed to 6.9%, we could see a little less of that scaling and that could be a factor in terms of bringing both SG&A and gross margin down closer to your targets?\n\n---\n\nThat's exactly it. So -- and in a certain way, the formula works. So if you say we reinvest in the gross margin to protect the top line and even stimulate it, but if you -- and when it gets stimulated, it creates scaling and it increases your margins so then you have more room to maneuver and to make sure that you get that compelling-ness out there. So yes, you're absolutely right. If the same-store sales would go down in the future quarters, that would naturally have an effect, a reverse scaling, if you want, on the margin.\n\n---\n\nOkay, that's great. And then finally, if I might, could you just give us an update on the rollout of the WiFi into the stores, how that's all coming along at this point?\n\n---\n\nOkay. So we've just begun the implementation, and so we're -- there are different steps. One is setting up the antennas, if you want, in the stores and then you have to train employees, implement the devices. So that all takes time. And by the time we deployed, if you want, and train the employees and all of that, it will be more towards the end of the year that you would start seeing any form of benefit associated to that implementation. So that's why I mentioned earlier that the benefits from that will come in -- kick in more next year. So we'll -- and we have to take our time and make sure that we do it correctly and that the employees and managers and everyone involved is properly trained and understands how we operate it. So. . .\n\n---\n\nLet me ask you a question. So if we're 50% deployed, you're not going to see any benefits from that 50% of the stores?\n\n---\n\nNo, no, exactly because there's the deployment and there's the training, then there's the activating on -- live on our systems. So the benefits of that -- those initiatives, the savings of those, we'll see in the future years.\n\n---\n\nLarry, has there been any easing of the rent situation for new stores out West, especially in Alberta?\n\n---\n\nI would say no. They're not going up, but they're not easing. I think that answers your question. We're not getting higher rental rates, but I don't think we're getting lower ones. I'm -- this afternoon, as soon as I'm finished with this session, I'm off to the ICSC at the Westin downtown. I can give you a clear -- but that's -- I mean, I don't have to get there to tell you that, that's what's happening out West and all -- I would say across Canada, too.\n\n---\n\nAnd at this point, what's your expectation for rents over the next year?\n\n---\n\nI would say similar to what they are today. They -- I don't think they'll go up. You have to absorb the Target space and other people going under. I think the rates will be similar to what they've been in the last couple of years. You will not get any rate increases, I don't think.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And just switching topics. There's a topic we haven't discussed in quite some time, which is the possibility of a Western Canada distribution center. Do you think now that, that's ever possible?\n\n---\n\nI don't like saying never, but at the moment, it makes no sense. The effort is -- I can never say never. But at the moment, it doesn't make sense.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And just the back end of the store, labor productivity, you've made -- certainly made some improvements. Should we be expecting much over the next 6 to 8 months on improvements in labor productivity?\n\n---\n\nI'll let my colleague answer that one.\n\n---\n\nYes. Enough to show some improvement on the G&A, and I gave you the target, 16.5% to 17%. So definitely, it's moving in the right direction.\n\n---\n\nOkay. One last question. Is there any chance that consumables would be expanded in your stores over the next year or so, perhaps by adding larger scale or -- larger-scale coolers or -- for refrigeration?\n\n---\n\nWe have not talked about that at all, so my answer to you would be no. Again, I never say never, but we have not talked about that at all. I don't want to cut things off permanently. That would be unwise to do, but that's not certainly happening in the foreseeable future, and I don't see it happening -- I don't like to say ever, but I don't see it happening.\n\n---\n\nSo Larry, are you surprised at how well items at the higher end of the price point have done? And secondly, are you finding more and more products that you don't currently carry in that price range that can help you keep the stores refreshed?\n\n---\n\nI think my answer to both of your questions is yes. So someone would have had to listen quite carefully then. I'm pleasantly surprised, and I think we can find more items at that midpoint from $2 to $3 much easier than we could have at the $1 price point.\n\n---\n\nAnd from a percent margin standpoint, I mean, in the past, when you've gone into new price points, you've cautioned that the margins as a percentage might prove to be lower than some of your established product categories. Are you finding a change in that direction? Maybe perhaps you're gaining a bit more confidence in terms of how to price a certain item and what kind of volume you can get?\n\n---\n\nWell, I would have said yes before this foreign exchange problem. As we say -- as we get used to the $3 price point, the $2.50, $3 price point, sure, we're feeling a lot more comfortable as buyers and as merchandisers. And we're looking at our gross margins at those price levels more carefully because, yes, they -- it's not a question of \"I cautioned you.\" I said it's a fact. So we're looking at those margins at those price points, but we have to absorb and deal with the foreign exchange problem that has come upon us rather quickly. So it's a fight, it's a constant battle between giving -- trying to find a happy medium in all these price points.\n\n---\n\nJust sort of looking at your hedging strategy. Just wondering -- like, the Canadian dollar has had some volatility obviously, not just in terms of its compression, but then in terms of a modest rebound as the WTI trade has sort of unwound a bit. How did you approach hedging? Like, were you systematically creeping out further in time? Did you just got to make a big bet on the year? Just so we can understand whether there's heightened FX pressure risk as we go through the year or how that's going to play.\n\n---\n\nYes. The color we gave on hedging, and it still stands, is we hedge out at least the first 6 months ahead of us. And typically, we'll pick it up between 6 and 1 year. So that's the color we've been -- that's how we've been managing it.\n\n---\n\nSo the question is, do we automatically on a month-to-month fill in the...\n\n---\n\nI assume it's more by season really and probably in terms of large inventory commitments.\n\n---\n\nThere's both, there's both. Season -- we're always looking at that problem. We'll call it a problem for now.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And my last question is still on sort of the same subject. Just in the press release, you did mention that your product gross margins were up in the quarter. I'm just trying to understand -- like, do you feel like you've taken prices up in certain categories ahead of future FX risk in those categories?\n\n---\n\nI don't think we've done that. I'll let Michael -- maybe he has a different opinion. Go ahead.\n\n---\n\nSo the question is if we've -- yes, the product margin did increase, and that's -- to pinpoint it exactly, Jim, is very hard to do. But typically, it's a mix of all of that. As we said, when the buyers commit -- when we refresh 25%, 30% of our SKUs, the buyers commit. They know at what currency they're committing to and so on, and so it's just part of that process.\n\n---\n\nJust really more a couple of housekeeping questions. Can you guys provide us any sort of update on the Latin America network?\n\n---\n\nOkay. Well, as usual, it's going very well. We're 3 years into it. It's going more or less according to plan, still not material, and we continue to participate and monitor and assist in accordance with our licensing and servicing agreement.\n\n---\n\nAnd just on the sales progression in Latin America. I think in the past, you guys have said that it's been sort of double-digit sales growth. Is that continuing?\n\n---\n\nThe sales are doing very well over there. They're still doing very well, yes.\n\n---\n\nOkay, great. And in terms of what you guys are seeing in terms of your costs in Asia, what trends should we be looking at there? Are prices going up or are prices going down?\n\n---\n\nWell, in my opinion, they're soft. In other words, they're stable. We're getting some breaks in certain categories. Certain categories are a little more difficult. In other categories -- Neil, do you find some categories going up, in fact? No, very little. So we're status quo or getting some price breaks. But the price break, if you get 1% or 2% or 3%, that's pretty good. It certainly doesn't cover our foreign exchange issues.\n\n---\n\nRight, okay. But it certainly is not acting as another headwind, okay. That's great.\n\n---\n\nNo, it's not. No, it's not. No, not at the moment. No, it's not.\n\n---\n\nThe question I have for you is with relation to your new store builds. I think a year ago, you had 27 new stores in the quarter; this year, 17. I was just wondering if -- how that might affect your gross profit margins and your SG&A and if that has a bit of a fleeting effect, positive or negative, in the quarter and that we'll see some kind of normalization, if you will, into the next quarters.\n\n---\n\nNo, it doesn't have an effect. The new store openings and the timing doesn't have a material -- in fact, you wouldn't really see it.\n\n---\n\nI think, David, it's a question of timing here. It could have been 25, like '17, and then next quarter would be reversed. It's just a question when we're handed over those stores ready and when we can open them. I mean we open them as soon as we get them or a couple of weeks thereafter. So it's a question of timing, but your question, I think, was answered by Michael.\n\n---\n\nJust wondering your thoughts -- to get your thoughts, Larry, perhaps for you, on product safety. As you know, some U.S. retailers have had challenges with that, particularly related to imported products from Asia into North America and different standards and call it, customer trust in the brand as well. Just wondering how you guys think about that, and any color there would be appreciated.\n\n---\n\nYes. I'll let Michael answer, but don't jinx us here because we've been pretty good lately. So I'll...\n\n---\n\nYes. I think our track...\n\n---\n\nFor several years, our track record...\n\n---\n\nOur track record talks to that pretty well. Obviously, we are very -- how can I say it? It's a priority for us, and we want to maintain the highest standards and -- vis-à-vis that. So we make sure that the quality of our products and the safety is looked at very much. And so we, again, the track record, haven't had any major cases and few cases over the past 9 years, in fact.\n\n---\n\nAnd I'll add a little color, which is all the products that are more sensitive to safety issues: baby products, food, et cetera, all go through an entirely different process than general merchandise. And for example, for food, every single delivery of food -- even if it's from the same vendor of the same product, every delivery, products are sampled and tested. And we have a ton of processes in place to make sure that we are doing everything we can to avoid any issues. And when there is an issue, very, very infrequently, it's dealt with immediately to remove the issue from the stores and from the table, so to speak.\n\n---\n\nIn spite of everything having been said, anything can happen.\n\n---\n\nUnderstood. Just wondering, are your processes, with regard to product safety and regulation, are those increasing? Or are those fairly stable over the last couple of years?\n\n---\n\nWe have increased what we do about 3 years ago. And for the last 3 years, they've been stable. But we increased our processes and our testing on sensitive categories about 3 years ago, and we've been very diligent about each of those tests. Protocols are all kept in place and monitored constantly.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And just another quick one here. I think I know the answer, but I just want to get your thoughts. As you enter into H2 for the fiscal year, the second half, the comps become more difficult. And given that DOL doesn't substantially rely on flyer marketing, I was just wondering how the company looks at that. Are there merchandising adjustments? Or is it just business as usual?\n\n---\n\nMy answer would be business as usual. We don't get involved in flyers advertising, and we count more or less on our good value to keep things going. And it's business as usual. Some would call that boring, but there it is.\n\n---\n\nLarry, you were talking about looking at potentially going above the $3 price point. But I'm curious, as we're looking at this inflationary effect from the foreign exchange, are you getting like a broad increase in the pricing of the products all through the $1 to $3 price point? Or is it incrementally more at the $3 price point that you seem to imply there's a lot more stuff there.\n\n---\n\nNo. No, I don't think we're getting any price increases, period, whether it's $1, $2, $3. I can't tell you about $10 because we don't go there. But we're, generally speaking, not getting price increases from the Orient. The Orient being, in our case, well, 90% China. So the answer to that is no. We're not getting pricing...\n\n---\n\nNo, it's more, as you're moving to more sales from units or items above the $1 price point, is that spread equally, again, on the products above that $1 price point? Or is there...\n\n---\n\nI don't think we concentrate in saying so many of $2, so many of $2.50. So it's just we're -- we buy what we feel is good value.\n\n---\n\nOpportunity.\n\n---\n\nYes, yes. It's the same as real estate. Really, it's opportunity-driven. So if it happens to be good value at $2, so be it. And if it happens to be $2.50, so be it. I don't think we're saying, \"Stop buying things at $2.50 in order to -- and buy more of $3.\" We never use that headspace.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then if you look at the competitive environment, you've always had this really sweet spot right below the $3 level. If you do consider, just from your thoughts, of moving into the $4 or $5 price point or stuff like that, does it change anything as far as your competitive stance versus, say, a Dollar Tree or a Walmart or such? Or is everybody under the same pressure to look at those higher items?\n\n---\n\nI would think everyone is under the same pressure. I can't see absorbing 15% to 25% foreign exchange differences and not think that every retailer is going to be concerned with it. So we -- our business is to give good value, excellent value where we can, keep our whole operation simple to be able to do that. And I don't think we want to go -- if we do think of going above $3, I don't think we want to go above $4, if that thought comes to be. Certainly, I can reemphasize that we're doing nothing for this year and I would say for the next year -- not only this year, for the next year about pricing above -- of going above $3. And because I can -- I don't like speculating too far ahead. That's why I say that everything is possible. After that, I don't know. We'll see as time goes on. We'll see where the Canadian dollar is. If it goes to $1.40, we have another problem.\n\n---\n\nOkay, fair enough. And just from the locations that you have, your guidance for the number of new stores this year is maintained, I assume. And then can you say anything about location availability for your 70 to 80 new stores?\n\n---\n\nI think we're good for 70 to 80 new stores. With the amount of stores we have today, we often -- I'll take an example. In Magog, Québec, we have a better location opportunity. We have opened it, and we're going to close another one. So it's a new store, yet it's a reduction of another store that's next to it. So I think we can manage 70 to 80 net new stores this year in that area.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And no commentary about locations that might be available beyond that? Just getting your...\n\n---\n\nI don't think we can get much beyond that. If it happens, it happens, but no, no.\n\n---\n\nI was wondering about regional breakdown of sales. I think the weather was very good in British Columbia, very poor in the Maritimes. Was there significantly more variation across the country than usual?\n\n---\n\nWhen, Keith? I don't even know if we can answer the question, but when are you talking about?\n\n---\n\nIn the Q1. I was thinking the February, March period was quite difficult in Atlantic Canada.\n\n---\n\nYou're probably right. It was very difficult.\n\n---\n\nIt was difficult last year, too. So I think that you shouldn't put too much emphasis on that.\n\n---\n\nYes. I would think you're right, Michael.\n\n---\n\nAnd then just in terms of the 2 months since all the Target stores have closed, has that affected traffic? Or you're...\n\n---\n\nMy impression is no, but I'll let Michael who's got more...\n\n---\n\nNo, it hasn't, you're right.\n\n---\n\nNo, it hasn't.\n\n---\n\nYes. No impact, it's neutral. As we told you the last quarter, the liquidation had a small impact, and now it seems to have stabled out. And...\n\n---\n\nYes. We had a negative impact when Zellers closed, when Target was liquidating, and that only lasted for that period of time. They can only liquidate for so much and so long in so many stores. So it's a temporary thing, but it's not -- doesn't help when the time -- when it happens. But it's not serious, so...\n\n---\n\nAnd just in terms of freight, I guess the U.S. dollar price of oil goes -- has gone down with the Canadian dollar's going down. So what's the net impact? Are you doing better on freight or worse on freight? Or...\n\n---\n\nNo, I personally can't give you the net impact, but I can tell you that our freight costs have decreased. Michael?\n\n---\n\nNo, that's accurate. So the cost of outbound transport has decreased due to the decrease in energy costs, for sure.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And then just in terms of SG&A, if you x out the scaling impact in the first quarter, what were the most significant elements of reduced SG&A percentage?\n\n---\n\nWell, it's the store labor initiative, the efficiencies that we gained from the systems we implemented over the past 3 years. And so that -- as we told you in the past, when you implement these systems, they offer a ton of functionalities, a lot of functionalities, many that you'll never use, others that you activate as you go along in a logical way. And so that's what we've seen and should continue to see throughout the year, and we're working on other initiatives to sustain that type of savings, hopefully, to offset future headwinds in the future.\n\n---\n\nAnd let me add that, I guess, we were out of a COO for about a year, and the addition of Johanne and the amount of attention she's giving to the stores is also another factor. It's an intangible, but it's there and it's important.\n\n---\n\nAnd in terms of minimum wage outlook, there seem to be some proposals, some actual changes. How -- what's your outlook across Canada on that issue?\n\n---\n\nWell, it's hard to say. The color we got from -- anyway, the 2 -- no, Ontario last year and a few other provinces that in the future, they would follow the inflation rate index, so that's kind of the color we heard. So we'll see.\n\n---\n\nAnd then just sort of a question on your positioning in the market. I guess the major competitor talks about being the largest single price -- or the single-price dollar store in Canada, and you've now got 73% of your product sales priced above $1. Like, do you see a segment -- like, the segment splitting in 2 here? Or how do you see that?\n\n---\n\nOkay. So you made the statement that we'll say Dollar Tree is the largest -- what did you say?\n\n---\n\nThey call themselves the largest single-priced dollar store, the $1.25. Your product mix is shifting increasingly to higher price points, and I'm just wondering whether you see a segmentation occurring in the dollar store segment between. . .\n\n---\n\nWell, I've -- well, they are -- they're right in making their statement, and I guess the dollar store segment in the states includes Family Dollar and Dollar General. That's -- and they are way above $1. So I don't know who's creating these categories, but I don't think I'd get too involved in those things. We are who we are. They are who they are. And somebody out there is saying they're a dollar store and they're not a dollar store. You lost me on this one, I'm sorry.\n\n---\n\nYes. No, I'm just wondering whether consumers are looking at you differently than your competitor as their average price point per unit is higher in your store than the other. Or you think it's same customer just going for the best value?\n\n---\n\nI think it's the same customer. They're going for value. We have a lot of articles still at $1 that they -- that our competitor may be $1.25 at. I think it's the same customer. It's not the customer -- I mean, it's the same customer. It's the same customer that goes to Walmart for all intents and purposes. So I think it's the same customer certainly between Dollar Tree and Dollarama.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Peter Sklar (Analysts)】\nWe noticed that your higher price point penetration continues to grow. Can you talk about the underlying dynamics? Are you offering more SKUs at higher price points? Or are consumers just buying more of the existing mix of higher-price-point items? Or just talk a little bit about how that penetration is growing.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nPeter, it's Larry. First of all, good morning. Second of all, I would think -- I don't have the numbers in front of me, but we are -- I would think we are increasing our selection of $3 items, which would result in greater sales of that category. The tendency when you're out there buying is to -- we're not being offered very, very much at $1 price point, especially the $1 price point today would have to absorb the 20%, 25% exchange rate. So we have more potential at the higher price points, I mean, when we talk higher price points, it's all relative, of course, but our higher price points, to give value. And as a result, that's being seen by the public, appreciated by the public, and we're seeing those in the numbers. I don't -- I think I've answered your question, Peter.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Peter Sklar (Analysts)】\nYes, you have, Larry. And I know people ask you this question often, but what's your thinking about taking things above the high end of the range, above $3?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nI didn't think that would come so quickly. Well, for this year, we're holding, we're holding. For next year -- we're always thinking about what we have to do to maintain our gross margins, and I'd be a liar to tell you that we're not thinking about it. It's obvious. I think all retailers are looking at their margins very carefully these days, very particularly in Canada and well, around the world, I guess. And we're interested in Canada, and to think that we can absorb 20%, 25% and maintain margins is unrealistic. So we're going to absorb what we can intelligently and then handle the rest as time moves on. So certainly, there's serious thought towards it, but for this year, we're going to maintain as if we're at par, all right, maintain and absorb in a sense. But I feel comfortable in that. We have enough hedging done to make us feel comfortable that we can maintain our retails.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kenric Tyghe (Analysts)】\nI'd like to drill down a little, if I could, on the inventory numbers in the quarter. Michael, you called out sort of the preordering, et cetera, in the quarter. I wonder if you can give us an idea of how much of the inventory increase was on preordering or at least sort of break down some of the inventory bloat for us. And then the follow-on would be just your comfort level or conviction around your inventory productivity as we sort of cycle through the preordering, et cetera, looking through the rest of fiscal '16.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nYes. Without going into the specifics, everything I mentioned had a significant impact, so preordering, the mix and so the --\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nHigher price point.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nAnd yes, the higher price point mix and the -- but -- and opportunity buying. So all of that -- it's timing. So that did happen, and I'm not preoccupied. Otherwise, we've got good visibility on our inventory, and so you'll see the inventory levels coming down a bit to the more normal levels that we've been used to in the past.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kenric Tyghe (Analysts)】\nGreat. And then just switching gears very quickly to gross margin performance. Are you able or inclined to share with us the compression -- the FX-driven compression or the sort of FX-driven investment in the proposition? Just trying to sort of tease that out of your gross margin performance.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nNo. I mean, the margin is doing very well for the factors I mentioned earlier. And I think that what we have to do -- you have to do is come back to what our aim is, and our aim is to keep it within the 36% to 37% range. Right now, it's in the top end of that. And so we -- again, we want to balance the offering that we give versus the return to our shareholder, and so that's as much color as we will give you. Like Larry said, hedging allowed us to absorb definitely a part of the headwind we got from the currency. But we -- and as we said in the past, it's manageable, so it's a clear demonstration of that. But again, if you're looking at the future, we're still looking to keep it within the range I mentioned.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Irene Nattel (Analysts)】\nJust continuing with the actual sales mix. Larry, you noted that you're seeing better sales of items at $3, that there's a higher penetration of higher-priced items. Can you give us an idea at this point of what the proportion of items sold in the store is at the lower end of the price point versus the higher end of the price range?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nI think -- Michael, help me out on this. I think, basically, our sales are 70 -- or over 70% over that price point, right?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nNo -- yes. In sales dollars, it's 73%. But I think Irene's question is try to give more color as to the -- which price points.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nThat's a moving target, and that's difficult to -- I wouldn't have a clue unless I can get to tomorrow.[ph]\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\n.\r\nYes. We prefer not to disclose. Then we'd be disclosing more or less the mix that we'd rather not do.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Irene Nattel (Analysts)】\nOkay. Well, let me ask -- in the past, okay, in the releases, you -- it said that the majority of items sold are still at $1. I did not see that, so either I missed it or it's not there. Is it, in fact, in there? Or did you take it out?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nNo, we took it out.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Irene Nattel (Analysts)】\nOkay. That's very helpful. So that answers the question. And then just coming back to the whole question of SG&A leverage and gross margin. You mentioned the scaling benefit for both of those. So is it fair to say that if we see things -- or sales kind of go more towards that 4% to 5% range or 5% -- in the upper end of that range as opposed to 6.9%, we could see a little less of that scaling and that could be a factor in terms of bringing both SG&A and gross margin down closer to your targets?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nThat's exactly it. So -- and in a certain way, the formula works. So if you say we reinvest in the gross margin to protect the top line and even stimulate it, but if you -- and when it gets stimulated, it creates scaling and it increases your margins so then you have more room to maneuver and to make sure that you get that compelling-ness out there. So yes, you're absolutely right. If the same-store sales would go down in the future quarters, that would naturally have an effect, a reverse scaling, if you want, on the margin.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Irene Nattel (Analysts)】\nOkay, that's great. And then finally, if I might, could you just give us an update on the rollout of the WiFi into the stores, how that's all coming along at this point?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nOkay. So we've just begun the implementation, and so we're -- there are different steps. One is setting up the antennas, if you want, in the stores and then you have to train employees, implement the devices. So that all takes time. And by the time we deployed, if you want, and train the employees and all of that, it will be more towards the end of the year that you would start seeing any form of benefit associated to that implementation. So that's why I mentioned earlier that the benefits from that will come in -- kick in more next year. So we'll -- and we have to take our time and make sure that we do it correctly and that the employees and managers and everyone involved is properly trained and understands how we operate it. So. . .\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nLet me ask you a question. So if we're 50% deployed, you're not going to see any benefits from that 50% of the stores?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nNo, no, exactly because there's the deployment and there's the training, then there's the activating on -- live on our systems. So the benefits of that -- those initiatives, the savings of those, we'll see in the future years.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Perry Caicco (Analysts)】\nLarry, has there been any easing of the rent situation for new stores out West, especially in Alberta?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nI would say no. They're not going up, but they're not easing. I think that answers your question. We're not getting higher rental rates, but I don't think we're getting lower ones. I'm -- this afternoon, as soon as I'm finished with this session, I'm off to the ICSC at the Westin downtown. I can give you a clear -- but that's -- I mean, I don't have to get there to tell you that, that's what's happening out West and all -- I would say across Canada, too.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Perry Caicco (Analysts)】\nAnd at this point, what's your expectation for rents over the next year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nI would say similar to what they are today. They -- I don't think they'll go up. You have to absorb the Target space and other people going under. I think the rates will be similar to what they've been in the last couple of years. You will not get any rate increases, I don't think.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Perry Caicco (Analysts)】\nOkay. And just switching topics. There's a topic we haven't discussed in quite some time, which is the possibility of a Western Canada distribution center. Do you think now that, that's ever possible?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nI don't like saying never, but at the moment, it makes no sense. The effort is -- I can never say never. But at the moment, it doesn't make sense.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Perry Caicco (Analysts)】\nOkay. And just the back end of the store, labor productivity, you've made -- certainly made some improvements. Should we be expecting much over the next 6 to 8 months on improvements in labor productivity?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nI'll let my colleague answer that one.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nYes. Enough to show some improvement on the G&A, and I gave you the target, 16.5% to 17%. So definitely, it's moving in the right direction.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Perry Caicco (Analysts)】\nOkay. One last question. Is there any chance that consumables would be expanded in your stores over the next year or so, perhaps by adding larger scale or -- larger-scale coolers or -- for refrigeration?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nWe have not talked about that at all, so my answer to you would be no. Again, I never say never, but we have not talked about that at all. I don't want to cut things off permanently. That would be unwise to do, but that's not certainly happening in the foreseeable future, and I don't see it happening -- I don't like to say ever, but I don't see it happening.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Durran (Analysts)】\nSo Larry, are you surprised at how well items at the higher end of the price point have done? And secondly, are you finding more and more products that you don't currently carry in that price range that can help you keep the stores refreshed?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nI think my answer to both of your questions is yes. So someone would have had to listen quite carefully then. I'm pleasantly surprised, and I think we can find more items at that midpoint from $2 to $3 much easier than we could have at the $1 price point.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Durran (Analysts)】\nAnd from a percent margin standpoint, I mean, in the past, when you've gone into new price points, you've cautioned that the margins as a percentage might prove to be lower than some of your established product categories. Are you finding a change in that direction? Maybe perhaps you're gaining a bit more confidence in terms of how to price a certain item and what kind of volume you can get?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nWell, I would have said yes before this foreign exchange problem. As we say -- as we get used to the $3 price point, the $2.50, $3 price point, sure, we're feeling a lot more comfortable as buyers and as merchandisers. And we're looking at our gross margins at those price levels more carefully because, yes, they -- it's not a question of \"I cautioned you.\" I said it's a fact. So we're looking at those margins at those price points, but we have to absorb and deal with the foreign exchange problem that has come upon us rather quickly. So it's a fight, it's a constant battle between giving -- trying to find a happy medium in all these price points.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Durran (Analysts)】\nJust sort of looking at your hedging strategy. Just wondering -- like, the Canadian dollar has had some volatility obviously, not just in terms of its compression, but then in terms of a modest rebound as the WTI trade has sort of unwound a bit. How did you approach hedging? Like, were you systematically creeping out further in time? Did you just got to make a big bet on the year? Just so we can understand whether there's heightened FX pressure risk as we go through the year or how that's going to play.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nYes. The color we gave on hedging, and it still stands, is we hedge out at least the first 6 months ahead of us. And typically, we'll pick it up between 6 and 1 year. So that's the color we've been -- that's how we've been managing it.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nSo the question is, do we automatically on a month-to-month fill in the...\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Durran (Analysts)】\nI assume it's more by season really and probably in terms of large inventory commitments.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nThere's both, there's both. Season -- we're always looking at that problem. We'll call it a problem for now.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Durran (Analysts)】\nOkay. And my last question is still on sort of the same subject. Just in the press release, you did mention that your product gross margins were up in the quarter. I'm just trying to understand -- like, do you feel like you've taken prices up in certain categories ahead of future FX risk in those categories?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nI don't think we've done that. I'll let Michael -- maybe he has a different opinion. Go ahead.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nSo the question is if we've -- yes, the product margin did increase, and that's -- to pinpoint it exactly, Jim, is very hard to do. But typically, it's a mix of all of that. As we said, when the buyers commit -- when we refresh 25%, 30% of our SKUs, the buyers commit. They know at what currency they're committing to and so on, and so it's just part of that process.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Derek Dley (Analysts)】\nJust really more a couple of housekeeping questions. Can you guys provide us any sort of update on the Latin America network?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nOkay. Well, as usual, it's going very well. We're 3 years into it. It's going more or less according to plan, still not material, and we continue to participate and monitor and assist in accordance with our licensing and servicing agreement.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Derek Dley (Analysts)】\nAnd just on the sales progression in Latin America. I think in the past, you guys have said that it's been sort of double-digit sales growth. Is that continuing?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nThe sales are doing very well over there. They're still doing very well, yes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Derek Dley (Analysts)】\nOkay, great. And in terms of what you guys are seeing in terms of your costs in Asia, what trends should we be looking at there? Are prices going up or are prices going down?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nWell, in my opinion, they're soft. In other words, they're stable. We're getting some breaks in certain categories. Certain categories are a little more difficult. In other categories -- Neil, do you find some categories going up, in fact? No, very little. So we're status quo or getting some price breaks. But the price break, if you get 1% or 2% or 3%, that's pretty good. It certainly doesn't cover our foreign exchange issues.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Derek Dley (Analysts)】\nRight, okay. But it certainly is not acting as another headwind, okay. That's great.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nNo, it's not. No, it's not. No, not at the moment. No, it's not.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Hartley (Analysts)】\nThe question I have for you is with relation to your new store builds. I think a year ago, you had 27 new stores in the quarter; this year, 17. I was just wondering if -- how that might affect your gross profit margins and your SG&A and if that has a bit of a fleeting effect, positive or negative, in the quarter and that we'll see some kind of normalization, if you will, into the next quarters.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nNo, it doesn't have an effect. The new store openings and the timing doesn't have a material -- in fact, you wouldn't really see it.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nI think, David, it's a question of timing here. It could have been 25, like '17, and then next quarter would be reversed. It's just a question when we're handed over those stores ready and when we can open them. I mean we open them as soon as we get them or a couple of weeks thereafter. So it's a question of timing, but your question, I think, was answered by Michael.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Vishal Shreedhar (Analysts)】\nJust wondering your thoughts -- to get your thoughts, Larry, perhaps for you, on product safety. As you know, some U.S. retailers have had challenges with that, particularly related to imported products from Asia into North America and different standards and call it, customer trust in the brand as well. Just wondering how you guys think about that, and any color there would be appreciated.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nYes. I'll let Michael answer, but don't jinx us here because we've been pretty good lately. So I'll...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nYes. I think our track...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nFor several years, our track record...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nOur track record talks to that pretty well. Obviously, we are very -- how can I say it? It's a priority for us, and we want to maintain the highest standards and -- vis-à-vis that. So we make sure that the quality of our products and the safety is looked at very much. And so we, again, the track record, haven't had any major cases and few cases over the past 9 years, in fact.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Neil Rossy (Executives)】\nAnd I'll add a little color, which is all the products that are more sensitive to safety issues: baby products, food, et cetera, all go through an entirely different process than general merchandise. And for example, for food, every single delivery of food -- even if it's from the same vendor of the same product, every delivery, products are sampled and tested. And we have a ton of processes in place to make sure that we are doing everything we can to avoid any issues. And when there is an issue, very, very infrequently, it's dealt with immediately to remove the issue from the stores and from the table, so to speak.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nIn spite of everything having been said, anything can happen.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Vishal Shreedhar (Analysts)】\nUnderstood. Just wondering, are your processes, with regard to product safety and regulation, are those increasing? Or are those fairly stable over the last couple of years?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Neil Rossy (Executives)】\nWe have increased what we do about 3 years ago. And for the last 3 years, they've been stable. But we increased our processes and our testing on sensitive categories about 3 years ago, and we've been very diligent about each of those tests. Protocols are all kept in place and monitored constantly.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Vishal Shreedhar (Analysts)】\nOkay. And just another quick one here. I think I know the answer, but I just want to get your thoughts. As you enter into H2 for the fiscal year, the second half, the comps become more difficult. And given that DOL doesn't substantially rely on flyer marketing, I was just wondering how the company looks at that. Are there merchandising adjustments? Or is it just business as usual?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nMy answer would be business as usual. We don't get involved in flyers advertising, and we count more or less on our good value to keep things going. And it's business as usual. Some would call that boring, but there it is.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Neil Linsdell (Analysts)】\nLarry, you were talking about looking at potentially going above the $3 price point. But I'm curious, as we're looking at this inflationary effect from the foreign exchange, are you getting like a broad increase in the pricing of the products all through the $1 to $3 price point? Or is it incrementally more at the $3 price point that you seem to imply there's a lot more stuff there.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nNo. No, I don't think we're getting any price increases, period, whether it's $1, $2, $3. I can't tell you about $10 because we don't go there. But we're, generally speaking, not getting price increases from the Orient. The Orient being, in our case, well, 90% China. So the answer to that is no. We're not getting pricing...\n\n---\n\n【質問: Neil Linsdell (Analysts)】\nNo, it's more, as you're moving to more sales from units or items above the $1 price point, is that spread equally, again, on the products above that $1 price point? Or is there...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nI don't think we concentrate in saying so many of $2, so many of $2.50. So it's just we're -- we buy what we feel is good value.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nOpportunity.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nYes, yes. It's the same as real estate. Really, it's opportunity-driven. So if it happens to be good value at $2, so be it. And if it happens to be $2.50, so be it. I don't think we're saying, \"Stop buying things at $2.50 in order to -- and buy more of $3.\" We never use that headspace.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Neil Linsdell (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then if you look at the competitive environment, you've always had this really sweet spot right below the $3 level. If you do consider, just from your thoughts, of moving into the $4 or $5 price point or stuff like that, does it change anything as far as your competitive stance versus, say, a Dollar Tree or a Walmart or such? Or is everybody under the same pressure to look at those higher items?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nI would think everyone is under the same pressure. I can't see absorbing 15% to 25% foreign exchange differences and not think that every retailer is going to be concerned with it. So we -- our business is to give good value, excellent value where we can, keep our whole operation simple to be able to do that. And I don't think we want to go -- if we do think of going above $3, I don't think we want to go above $4, if that thought comes to be. Certainly, I can reemphasize that we're doing nothing for this year and I would say for the next year -- not only this year, for the next year about pricing above -- of going above $3. And because I can -- I don't like speculating too far ahead. That's why I say that everything is possible. After that, I don't know. We'll see as time goes on. We'll see where the Canadian dollar is. If it goes to $1.40, we have another problem.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Neil Linsdell (Analysts)】\nOkay, fair enough. And just from the locations that you have, your guidance for the number of new stores this year is maintained, I assume. And then can you say anything about location availability for your 70 to 80 new stores?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nI think we're good for 70 to 80 new stores. With the amount of stores we have today, we often -- I'll take an example. In Magog, Québec, we have a better location opportunity. We have opened it, and we're going to close another one. So it's a new store, yet it's a reduction of another store that's next to it. So I think we can manage 70 to 80 net new stores this year in that area.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Neil Linsdell (Analysts)】\nOkay. And no commentary about locations that might be available beyond that? Just getting your...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nI don't think we can get much beyond that. If it happens, it happens, but no, no.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Keith Howlett (Analysts)】\nI was wondering about regional breakdown of sales. I think the weather was very good in British Columbia, very poor in the Maritimes. Was there significantly more variation across the country than usual?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nWhen, Keith? I don't even know if we can answer the question, but when are you talking about?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Keith Howlett (Analysts)】\nIn the Q1. I was thinking the February, March period was quite difficult in Atlantic Canada.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nYou're probably right. It was very difficult.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nIt was difficult last year, too. So I think that you shouldn't put too much emphasis on that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nYes. I would think you're right, Michael.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Keith Howlett (Analysts)】\nAnd then just in terms of the 2 months since all the Target stores have closed, has that affected traffic? Or you're...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nMy impression is no, but I'll let Michael who's got more...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nNo, it hasn't, you're right.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nNo, it hasn't.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nYes. No impact, it's neutral. As we told you the last quarter, the liquidation had a small impact, and now it seems to have stabled out. And...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nYes. We had a negative impact when Zellers closed, when Target was liquidating, and that only lasted for that period of time. They can only liquidate for so much and so long in so many stores. So it's a temporary thing, but it's not -- doesn't help when the time -- when it happens. But it's not serious, so...\n\n---\n\n【質問: Keith Howlett (Analysts)】\nAnd just in terms of freight, I guess the U.S. dollar price of oil goes -- has gone down with the Canadian dollar's going down. So what's the net impact? Are you doing better on freight or worse on freight? Or...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nNo, I personally can't give you the net impact, but I can tell you that our freight costs have decreased. Michael?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nNo, that's accurate. So the cost of outbound transport has decreased due to the decrease in energy costs, for sure.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Keith Howlett (Analysts)】\nGreat. And then just in terms of SG&A, if you x out the scaling impact in the first quarter, what were the most significant elements of reduced SG&A percentage?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nWell, it's the store labor initiative, the efficiencies that we gained from the systems we implemented over the past 3 years. And so that -- as we told you in the past, when you implement these systems, they offer a ton of functionalities, a lot of functionalities, many that you'll never use, others that you activate as you go along in a logical way. And so that's what we've seen and should continue to see throughout the year, and we're working on other initiatives to sustain that type of savings, hopefully, to offset future headwinds in the future.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nAnd let me add that, I guess, we were out of a COO for about a year, and the addition of Johanne and the amount of attention she's giving to the stores is also another factor. It's an intangible, but it's there and it's important.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Keith Howlett (Analysts)】\nAnd in terms of minimum wage outlook, there seem to be some proposals, some actual changes. How -- what's your outlook across Canada on that issue?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nWell, it's hard to say. The color we got from -- anyway, the 2 -- no, Ontario last year and a few other provinces that in the future, they would follow the inflation rate index, so that's kind of the color we heard. So we'll see.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Keith Howlett (Analysts)】\nAnd then just sort of a question on your positioning in the market. I guess the major competitor talks about being the largest single price -- or the single-price dollar store in Canada, and you've now got 73% of your product sales priced above $1. Like, do you see a segment -- like, the segment splitting in 2 here? Or how do you see that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nOkay. So you made the statement that we'll say Dollar Tree is the largest -- what did you say?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Keith Howlett (Analysts)】\nThey call themselves the largest single-priced dollar store, the $1.25. Your product mix is shifting increasingly to higher price points, and I'm just wondering whether you see a segmentation occurring in the dollar store segment between. . .\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nWell, I've -- well, they are -- they're right in making their statement, and I guess the dollar store segment in the states includes Family Dollar and Dollar General. That's -- and they are way above $1. So I don't know who's creating these categories, but I don't think I'd get too involved in those things. We are who we are. They are who they are. And somebody out there is saying they're a dollar store and they're not a dollar store. You lost me on this one, I'm sorry.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Keith Howlett (Analysts)】\nYes. No, I'm just wondering whether consumers are looking at you differently than your competitor as their average price point per unit is higher in your store than the other. Or you think it's same customer just going for the best value?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nI think it's the same customer. They're going for value. We have a lot of articles still at $1 that they -- that our competitor may be $1.25 at. I think it's the same customer. It's not the customer -- I mean, it's the same customer. It's the same customer that goes to Walmart for all intents and purposes. So I think it's the same customer certainly between Dollar Tree and Dollarama.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you, Hope, and good morning, everyone. On the call today are Rick Dreiling, our Chairman and CEO; Todd Vasos, our COO; and David Tehle, our CFO. We will first go through our prepared remarks, and then we will open up the call for questions. Our earnings release issued today can be found on our website at dollargeneral.com, under Investor Information, Press Releases. \r\nLet me caution you that today's comments will include forward-looking statements about our expectations, plans, predictions and other nonhistorical matters, such as our 2015 forecasted financial results and capital expenditures; our planned fiscal 2015 operating initiatives and merchandising initiatives; our 2015 and 2016 store growth initiatives; our share repurchase expectations; and capital allocation strategy and statements regarding future consumer economic trends. \r\nImportant factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those reflected in or implied by our forward-looking statements are included in our earnings release issued this morning, our 2014 10-K, which was filed on March 20, 2015, our 2015 first quarter 10-Q filed this morning; and in the comments that are made on this call. We encourage you to read these documents. You should not unduly rely on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of today's date. Dollar General disclaims any obligation to update or revise any information discussed in this call. \r\nNow it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Rick.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Mary Winn, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. Last week, we had very exciting news announcing that Todd Vasos would be the next CEO of Dollar General. Todd will be an excellent CEO and I believe a great future lies ahead for Dollar General under his leadership. I have worked side-by-side with Todd for many years. And I know firsthand his ability to be both strategic and tactical, to not only visualize success, but put together the right team with the right strategy to make it happen.\r\nAt Dollar General, I have loved our spirit of service and our passion for taking care of our customers, helping our employees grow and giving back to our communities. Working with this team has been incredibly rewarding and although this will be my last earnings conference call, I am excited to have the opportunity to remain as Chairman until the end of the fiscal year to support Todd as we drive the business. \r\nWith that, let's now turn to our results for the first quarter of 2015. This quarter is a very good start to the new year as we look to capitalize on the numerous opportunities ahead of us. Let's recap some of the highlights of the first quarter of 2015. First quarter sales increased 8.8% to $4.9 billion. We delivered same-store sales growth of 3.7% for the quarter. Overall, we were pleased with the sales cadence for the quarter, particularly in light of the Easter holiday shift to earlier in the year. \r\nIn the quarter, same-store sales growth was balanced across both consumables and non-consumables. The non-consumable categories have now had 5 consecutive quarters of improvement, with seasonal apparel and home all comping positive in the first quarter. I am pleased with the progress we've made in our non-consumable categories. For the 29th consecutive quarter, we increased both our customer traffic and average ticket. \r\nGross margin expanded by 45 basis points to 30.5%, which is our first margin expansion in 9 quarters. From a timing perspective, this generally coincides with our launch of tobacco in early 2013. \r\nNet income for the first quarter increased 14% to $253 million. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share increased 17% to $0.84. \r\nIn the first quarter, the negative financial impact from the West Coast port slowdown was not as great as we had anticipated. Due to the diligent work across both our supply chain and merchandising teams, we successfully mitigated the expected drag to sales and gross margin we had projected at the time of the fourth quarter call. \r\nDuring the quarter, we returned $600 million to shareholders through the repurchase of 7.1 million shares of common stock and the payment of a quarterly dividend. Given our performance in the first quarter, we are maintaining our sales and earnings guidance for the year.\r\nWe are constantly striving to fill the need to meet the changing demands of our customers. As we entered the year, I shared with you that we were cautiously optimistic for our core customer, as there appeared to be potential for tailwinds to outweigh the headwinds from macro trends. Even if gas prices have moved up from their recent lows year-over-year, gas prices are still off about $1 a gallon or down nearly 30% from last year's peak. \r\nRecent economic news includes unemployment claims falling to their lowest level in 15 years, with many economists believing that the U.S. is approaching full employment. So while this is encouraging news, our core customer is still struggling to stretch their household budget. Historically, our core customer is often the first to feel the negative effects when the economy weakens and she lags in benefiting from improvements in the economy. \r\nAs always, we will continue to look for ways to provide our customers with the everyday low prices that they can count on from Dollar General. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Todd, to talk about our operating initiatives for 2015.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Rick. Let me first say how excited and honored I am to have the privilege to lead Dollar General. I'm grateful that Rick will remain as Chairman, as his guidance and counsel will be incredibly valuable to me.\r\nTurning to the first quarter, we have made notable progress against our key initiatives for 2015. We continue to grow transactions and item units in syndicated share data for the quarter. In the most recent syndicated data, we experienced consistent mid- to high single-digit growth in both units and dollar share for the 4-, 12-, 24- and 52-week periods. \r\nAs we shared with you last quarter, we are on track to meet targeted labor investments to grow market share in a competitive environment, while providing for positive financial returns. Currently, we are in the midst of rolling out these selected labor investments in phases. We have 3 phases within the program. \r\nOur Phase 1 stores are now receiving the incremental labor investments. The store operations team has specific metrics and timetable for determining the financial return criteria for achieving results based on a similar 2014 test and learn program. Our 2014 test and learn stores continue to show improvement across performance metrics such as sales, shrink, in-stock, which are all very encouraging. \r\nThe great part of this initiative is that we can be nimble in making adjustments to the model as appropriate. Based on the 2014 test results and the early results of Phase 1, we are very encouraged by our progress. We anticipate rolling this investment to the Phase 2 and Phase 3 stores in the second half of the year.\r\nThe labor hour investment in this select group of stores is designed to ensure we deliver on our consumer expectations in more competitive markets, with product in-stock and a convenient shopping experience. Our goal is to reduce the truck-to-shelf time for merchandise in these stores, further supporting our goal of providing our consumer with the right product at the right time and at the right price.\r\nThe second investment in labor comes from the realignment of our store operations management structure to optimize the scale of our divisions, regions and districts to improve accountability and maximize mentorship and teamwork, all while driving stronger, more sustainable results. While reducing the average number of stores per district and optimizing their scale, we have reduced the time our district managers spend driving, so they can invest more time mentoring and coaching our store managers on developing and strengthening their teams. \r\nThese changes have been in place since February. While it's still early, our operational structure is better aligned for our field leaders to focus on store standards and ultimately, create a better and more consistent shopping experience for our consumers. Our expectation is that over time, this should help both our consumer satisfaction and our store manager turnover.\r\nIn addition, over the last several months, we've been testing a number of inventory management initiatives. For example, a new sky shelf program has been rolled out across 1/3 of the chain to allow for the placement of inventory directly above respective categories. This allows our teams to get product out of the back room to facilitate improved stocking and ultimately, drive labor efficiencies. To date, we are pleased with the test results and are planning on expanding the sky shelf program chain-wide. We expect the rollout to be completed by the third quarter of 2015.\r\nOn a combined basis, we believe these labor investments and inventory management initiatives are significant steps to improving our in-stock position, which is critical component of our overall consumer satisfaction and a driver of sales performance.\r\nOn the merchandising front, we had balanced same-store sales growth across all categories in the first quarter. Strength in consumables was driven by tobacco, perishables, health care and candy and snacks. In addition, we had broad-based strength across apparel with our ladies, men's and boys, infants and shoes continuing to exhibit strong performance, with all these departments comping in line or above the company average.\r\nSeasonal and home comps trends were very encouraging as well. Affordability is playing a key role as we look to expand SKUs across the store at our sweet spot of $1 to $5. For the first quarter, nearly 50% of our consumers' baskets contained at least one item priced at $1.\r\nOur Fast Way to Save digital coupon program is growing. Sign-ups are increasing. And as we exited the quarter, our redemption rate for digital coupons continued to improve. During the quarter, we executed our Fast Way to Save Spring Into Savings event, which had strong activity for the program. Measured on a weekly basis, redemptions, trips and sign-ups by consumers all improved during this promotion. In addition, sales in participating items significantly outpaced their respective categories and our overall comp sales. \r\nWe have embarked on the next phase of our offering by providing personalized coupons for our consumers based on their purchase behavior. We are able to use the data captured from this program like a loyalty card, but without the incremental cost. For instance, we plan to use these insights from a consumer shopping trip to customize individual promotions, which we believe will ultimately drive incremental trips and larger baskets. The data we gather also allows us to target media to these consumers in order to reach them more effectively and efficiently. \r\nShrink improvement has been and continues to be one of our largest gross margin opportunities. We remain committed to reducing our shrink at store level. For the quarter, we are very pleased with our shrink improvement. The progress is broad-based, with 19 of our 24 product departments showing improvement. For store inventories performed so far this year, approximately 70% of our regions also improved year-over-year. Going forward, our teams continue to be focused on leveraging our defensive merchandising tools, technology and training to reduce shrink.\r\nIn order to enhance our productivity gains, we are once again elevating the category management process. We are optimizing all areas of the store beyond the planograms to include off-shelf and end-cap displays. Additionally, we are collaborating with our vendor partners through our joint business planning process to develop our merchandising plans and activities even further out on the calendar to enhance our consumer shopping experience.\r\nOver the last several years, we have made significant strides in the productivity of our planograms through SKU selection and ongoing refinement. Our affordability philosophy is fully ingrained in our category management process. As a result, we have established a strong foundation in our planograms that we can redefine periodically. We are concentrated on simplifying work at the store by reducing the complexity of planogram resets and capturing labor savings that can be reinvested.\r\nAt Dollar General, real estate -- the real estate model is disciplined and focused on financial returns. We continue to see new store productivity at around 85% of our comp base, all while driving strong returns. We are very optimistic about our new store outlook for 2015, as our pipeline is full.\r\nThe Dollar General stores in our 3 new states of Maine, Rhode Island and Oregon, are off to a good start and their sales performance continues to accelerate. We have driven down the capital investments required for remodels, while also driving strong sales lifts of 4% to 5%, and an improved return on investment in excess of 200 basis points. \r\nThe real estate team is well on its way in building the pipeline for 2016. The planned growth in selling square feet of approximately 7% translates to approximately 900 new store openings. Our development pipeline is nearly 50% complete for planned 2016 store openings. We have released additional strategic trade areas to our real estate team and are experiencing increased deal velocity. We have a strong track record of delivering exceptional returns in our new store program and are confident in our model going forward.\r\nIn today's environment, we are extremely focused on doing everything we can to provide our customers with the value and convenience they expect from Dollar General. We continue to be committed as ever to providing our consumers with the everyday low price they know and trust. \r\nNow David will share a more detailed review of our first quarter financial performance and our outlook.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Rick and Todd have taken you through the highlights of our first quarter and many of our strategic initiatives, so I'll share more details on the rest of the financial results, starting with gross profit. \r\nGross profit for the first quarter was $1.5 billion or 30.5% of sales, an increase of 45 basis points from last year's first quarter. As compared to the prior year, the most significant drivers were higher initial inventory markups, better inventory shrink performance and lower transportation costs.\r\nSG&A expense increased by 13 basis points over the 2014 period to $1.1 billion or 21.8% of sales in the first quarter. The majority of the SG&A increase was due primarily to higher incentive compensation, advertising costs and repairs and maintenance. Partially offsetting these items were increased cash-back-related convenience fees. Our tax rate for the quarter was generally flat to last year at 37.7%.\r\nMoving now to our balance sheet and cash flow. At quarter end, merchandise inventories were $2.8 billion, up 9% in total and 3% on a per-store basis. We generated cash from operations of $344 million in the quarter, an increase of $92 million compared to the first quarter of 2014.\r\nDuring the quarter, we repurchased 7.1 million shares of our common stock for $535 million. We also paid our first dividend of $0.22 per common share outstanding totaling $66 million.\r\nSince the inception of the share repurchase program in December 2011, we have repurchased over $2.8 billion of our common stock. We currently have a remaining authorization of approximately $689 million. \r\nWe remain committed to our disciplined capital allocation strategy. We aim to create lasting value for our shareholders through anticipated quarterly dividends and share repurchases, all while maintaining our investment grade rating and managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt-to-EBITDA. \r\nNow turning to guidance. Looking forward, we continue to expect top line sales for 2015 to increase 8% to 9%. Overall, selling square footage is expected to grow approximately 6% and same-store sales are expected to increase by 3% to 3.5%. \r\nWe also continue to expect operating profit growth to be in the range of 7% to 9% over adjusted 2014 operating profit. Our expectation for diluted earnings per share remains $3.85 to $3.95 for the year. Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $500 million to $550 million. For the year, we plan to open approximately 730 new stores and relocate or remodel 875 stores. Further, we plan to open approximately 900 stores in 2016.\r\nConsistent with our plans as we enter the year, we would expect stronger growth rates in the first half of 2015, given that our laps are more challenging in the second half of the year. As our long-term track record demonstrates, Dollar General is well positioned to serve our customers in a wide variety of economic conditions, and in turn, deliver strong results for our shareholders over time.\r\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Rick.\n\n---\n\nThank you, David. As this is our last earnings call together, please accept my many thanks for your friendship and business partnership. What you've done over your career at Dollar General has been significant, from taking the company private in 2007 to our return to the public markets in 2009. You've been instrumental in transforming Dollar General and in fueling our impressive growth. For all of us at Dollar General, thank you for all you've done over the last 11 years.\r\nOur long-term commitment to growth and shareholder value are unchanged. Even as the competitive landscape continues to evolve, we have a business model that is proven and resilient. Our business generates significant cash flow and we are in a position to invest in store growth, while continuing to return cash to shareholders through consistent share repurchases and dividends.\r\nTo all of the 109,000 Dollar General employees that fulfill our mission of serving others by providing our customers with convenience, value and service every day, please accept my appreciation and thanks.\r\nWith that, Mary Winn, we would now like to open up the call to Todd and David for questions.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Hope, we'll take the first call, please.",

Even if gas prices have moved up from their recent lows year-over-year, gas prices are still off about $1 a gallon or down nearly 30% from last year's peak. \r\nRecent economic news includes unemployment claims falling to their lowest level in 15 years, with many economists believing that the U.S. is approaching full employment. So while this is encouraging news, our core customer is still struggling to stretch their household budget. Historically, our core customer is often the first to feel the negative effects when the economy weakens and she lags in benefiting from improvements in the economy. \r\nAs always, we will continue to look for ways to provide our customers with the everyday low prices that they can count on from Dollar General. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Todd, to talk about our operating initiatives for 2015.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Todd Vasos (Executives)】\nThank you, Rick. Let me first say how excited and honored I am to have the privilege to lead Dollar General. I'm grateful that Rick will remain as Chairman, as his guidance and counsel will be incredibly valuable to me.\r\nTurning to the first quarter, we have made notable progress against our key initiatives for 2015. We continue to grow transactions and item units in syndicated share data for the quarter. In the most recent syndicated data, we experienced consistent mid- to high single-digit growth in both units and dollar share for the 4-, 12-, 24- and 52-week periods. \r\nAs we shared with you last quarter, we are on track to meet targeted labor investments to grow market share in a competitive environment, while providing for positive financial returns. Currently, we are in the midst of rolling out these selected labor investments in phases. We have 3 phases within the program. \r\nOur Phase 1 stores are now receiving the incremental labor investments. The store operations team has specific metrics and timetable for determining the financial return criteria for achieving results based on a similar 2014 test and learn program. Our 2014 test and learn stores continue to show improvement across performance metrics such as sales, shrink, in-stock, which are all very encouraging. \r\nThe great part of this initiative is that we can be nimble in making adjustments to the model as appropriate. Based on the 2014 test results and the early results of Phase 1, we are very encouraged by our progress. We anticipate rolling this investment to the Phase 2 and Phase 3 stores in the second half of the year.\r\nThe labor hour investment in this select group of stores is designed to ensure we deliver on our consumer expectations in more competitive markets, with product in-stock and a convenient shopping experience. Our goal is to reduce the truck-to-shelf time for merchandise in these stores, further supporting our goal of providing our consumer with the right product at the right time and at the right price.\r\nThe second investment in labor comes from the realignment of our store operations management structure to optimize the scale of our divisions, regions and districts to improve accountability and maximize mentorship and teamwork, all while driving stronger, more sustainable results. While reducing the average number of stores per district and optimizing their scale, we have reduced the time our district managers spend driving, so they can invest more time mentoring and coaching our store managers on developing and strengthening their teams. \r\nThese changes have been in place since February. While it's still early, our operational structure is better aligned for our field leaders to focus on store standards and ultimately, create a better and more consistent shopping experience for our consumers. Our expectation is that over time, this should help both our consumer satisfaction and our store manager turnover.\r\nIn addition, over the last several months, we've been testing a number of inventory management initiatives. For example, a new sky shelf program has been rolled out across 1/3 of the chain to allow for the placement of inventory directly above respective categories. This allows our teams to get product out of the back room to facilitate improved stocking and ultimately, drive labor efficiencies. To date, we are pleased with the test results and are planning on expanding the sky shelf program chain-wide. We expect the rollout to be completed by the third quarter of 2015.\r\nOn a combined basis, we believe these labor investments and inventory management initiatives are significant steps to improving our in-stock position, which is critical component of our overall consumer satisfaction and a driver of sales performance.\r\nOn the merchandising front, we had balanced same-store sales growth across all categories in the first quarter. Strength in consumables was driven by tobacco, perishables, health care and candy and snacks. In addition, we had broad-based strength across apparel with our ladies, men's and boys, infants and shoes continuing to exhibit strong performance, with all these departments comping in line or above the company average.\r\nSeasonal and home comps trends were very encouraging as well. Affordability is playing a key role as we look to expand SKUs across the store at our sweet spot of $1 to $5. For the first quarter, nearly 50% of our consumers' baskets contained at least one item priced at $1.\r\nOur Fast Way to Save digital coupon program is growing. Sign-ups are increasing. And as we exited the quarter, our redemption rate for digital coupons continued to improve. During the quarter, we executed our Fast Way to Save Spring Into Savings event, which had strong activity for the program. Measured on a weekly basis, redemptions, trips and sign-ups by consumers all improved during this promotion. In addition, sales in participating items significantly outpaced their respective categories and our overall comp sales. \r\nWe have embarked on the next phase of our offering by providing personalized coupons for our consumers based on their purchase behavior. We are able to use the data captured from this program like a loyalty card, but without the incremental cost. For instance, we plan to use these insights from a consumer shopping trip to customize individual promotions, which we believe will ultimately drive incremental trips and larger baskets. The data we gather also allows us to target media to these consumers in order to reach them more effectively and efficiently. \r\nShrink improvement has been and continues to be one of our largest gross margin opportunities. We remain committed to reducing our shrink at store level. For the quarter, we are very pleased with our shrink improvement. The progress is broad-based, with 19 of our 24 product departments showing improvement. For store inventories performed so far this year, approximately 70% of our regions also improved year-over-year. Going forward, our teams continue to be focused on leveraging our defensive merchandising tools, technology and training to reduce shrink.\r\nIn order to enhance our productivity gains, we are once again elevating the category management process. We are optimizing all areas of the store beyond the planograms to include off-shelf and end-cap displays. Additionally, we are collaborating with our vendor partners through our joint business planning process to develop our merchandising plans and activities even further out on the calendar to enhance our consumer shopping experience.\r\nOver the last several years, we have made significant strides in the productivity of our planograms through SKU selection and ongoing refinement. Our affordability philosophy is fully ingrained in our category management process. As a result, we have established a strong foundation in our planograms that we can redefine periodically. We are concentrated on simplifying work at the store by reducing the complexity of planogram resets and capturing labor savings that can be reinvested.\r\nAt Dollar General, real estate -- the real estate model is disciplined and focused on financial returns. We continue to see new store productivity at around 85% of our comp base, all while driving strong returns. We are very optimistic about our new store outlook for 2015, as our pipeline is full.\r\nThe Dollar General stores in our 3 new states of Maine, Rhode Island and Oregon, are off to a good start and their sales performance continues to accelerate. We have driven down the capital investments required for remodels, while also driving strong sales lifts of 4% to 5%, and an improved return on investment in excess of 200 basis points. \r\nThe real estate team is well on its way in building the pipeline for 2016. The planned growth in selling square feet of approximately 7% translates to approximately 900 new store openings. Our development pipeline is nearly 50% complete for planned 2016 store openings. We have released additional strategic trade areas to our real estate team and are experiencing increased deal velocity. We have a strong track record of delivering exceptional returns in our new store program and are confident in our model going forward.\r\nIn today's environment, we are extremely focused on doing everything we can to provide our customers with the value and convenience they expect from Dollar General. We continue to be committed as ever to providing our consumers with the everyday low price they know and trust. \r\nNow David will share a more detailed review of our first quarter financial performance and our outlook.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: David Tehle (Executives)】\nThank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Rick and Todd have taken you through the highlights of our first quarter and many of our strategic initiatives, so I'll share more details on the rest of the financial results, starting with gross profit. \r\nGross profit for the first quarter was $1.5 billion or 30.5% of sales, an increase of 45 basis points from last year's first quarter. As compared to the prior year, the most significant drivers were higher initial inventory markups, better inventory shrink performance and lower transportation costs.\r\nSG&A expense increased by 13 basis points over the 2014 period to $1.1 billion or 21.8% of sales in the first quarter. The majority of the SG&A increase was due primarily to higher incentive compensation, advertising costs and repairs and maintenance. Partially offsetting these items were increased cash-back-related convenience fees. Our tax rate for the quarter was generally flat to last year at 37.7%.\r\nMoving now to our balance sheet and cash flow. At quarter end, merchandise inventories were $2.8 billion, up 9% in total and 3% on a per-store basis. We generated cash from operations of $344 million in the quarter, an increase of $92 million compared to the first quarter of 2014.\r\nDuring the quarter, we repurchased 7.1 million shares of our common stock for $535 million. We also paid our first dividend of $0.22 per common share outstanding totaling $66 million.\r\nSince the inception of the share repurchase program in December 2011, we have repurchased over $2.8 billion of our common stock. We currently have a remaining authorization of approximately $689 million. \r\nWe remain committed to our disciplined capital allocation strategy. We aim to create lasting value for our shareholders through anticipated quarterly dividends and share repurchases, all while maintaining our investment grade rating and managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt-to-EBITDA. \r\nNow turning to guidance. Looking forward, we continue to expect top line sales for 2015 to increase 8% to 9%. Overall, selling square footage is expected to grow approximately 6% and same-store sales are expected to increase by 3% to 3.5%. \r\nWe also continue to expect operating profit growth to be in the range of 7% to 9% over adjusted 2014 operating profit. Our expectation for diluted earnings per share remains $3.85 to $3.95 for the year. Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $500 million to $550 million. For the year, we plan to open approximately 730 new stores and relocate or remodel 875 stores. Further, we plan to open approximately 900 stores in 2016.\r\nConsistent with our plans as we enter the year, we would expect stronger growth rates in the first half of 2015, given that our laps are more challenging in the second half of the year. As our long-term track record demonstrates, Dollar General is well positioned to serve our customers in a wide variety of economic conditions, and in turn, deliver strong results for our shareholders over time.\r\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Rick.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nThank you, David. As this is our last earnings call together, please accept my many thanks for your friendship and business partnership. What you've done over your career at Dollar General has been significant, from taking the company private in 2007 to our return to the public markets in 2009. You've been instrumental in transforming Dollar General and in fueling our impressive growth. For all of us at Dollar General, thank you for all you've done over the last 11 years.\r\nOur long-term commitment to growth and shareholder value are unchanged. Even as the competitive landscape continues to evolve, we have a business model that is proven and resilient. Our business generates significant cash flow and we are in a position to invest in store growth, while continuing to return cash to shareholders through consistent share repurchases and dividends.\r\nTo all of the 109,000 Dollar General employees that fulfill our mission of serving others by providing our customers with convenience, value and service every day, please accept my appreciation and thanks.\r\nWith that, Mary Winn, we would now like to open up the call to Todd and David for questions.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Mary Winn Pilkington (Executives)】\nOkay. Hope, we'll take the first call, please.",
      "transcript_text3": "And congrats, Todd, and also congrats to you on the successful transition, Rick -- Rick and David.\n\n---\n\nThank you.\n\n---\n\nSo just want to talk about cadence. Rick, you spoke to being pleased with the sales cadence. Could you please help us understand how you started and ended the period from a same-store sales standpoint and quantify any impact from any one-off headwinds, such as the earlier Easter, whether there was an impact, note that's notable from weather or West Coast ports? And also, on sales, David reiterated the guidance regarding the first half better than the second half. Just any other color as we should be thinking about the second quarter trend to-date would be helpful.\n\n---\n\nYes, Paul, this is Todd, let me first say that the first quarter sales trajectory and trend were pretty much exactly like we thought they would be. Obviously, we knew the calendar. We knew that the Easter shift would play a key factor in how the quarter shaped up and it played out exactly the way we really thought it would and that was benefiting period 2 of the quarter and then taken away some sales in period 3. So the quarter shaped up pretty much like we thought. There was some headwind, as you indicated, with a little weather that we saw, just like everyone else, I'm sure, in that latter part of February, early March time frame. But as that subsided and mitigated, our sales returned to a more normalized pattern and again, where we thought. And as we look forward, Paul, we're pretty satisfied and confident in our guidance of sales that we put out at the beginning of the year. So I think the best way to look at it is that we're well on track to be within that guidance.\n\n---\n\nNow on gross margins, very good performance there, could you give a little bit more detail on what is driving the higher mark-ups? And are there any headwinds that we should be thinking about going forward that could offset some of the improvement in shrink and lower transportation cost?\n\n---\n\nPaul, we're very pleased with our gross margin performance. I think the teams did an outstanding job and to call out a few of the teams in supply chain and merchandising in particular, they did a real good job in mitigating some of that West Coast issue that we were facing and they did it over a course of a long period of time. As they saw this start to materialize, they made some very early changes late last year to move some goods to the East Coast, and that really helped us. Then as we looked at the quarter, the mix really did benefit us. And as you heard from the prepared remarks, we were very happy with our sales and our sales trajectories in non-consumables. And so as you look at the non-consumable piece, it helped our margin as we looked year-over-year. DC and trans did a nice job, as I indicated, not only on the West Coast piece, but also, they continue working their productivity gains within the DCs, as well as looking at how we mitigate any issues with some of the driver shortages that have been out there. Again, our teams, I think, have done a pretty good job with that. And of course, fuel helped a little bit, as it is much lower than last year. And then lastly, we're very, very encouraged by our shrink results and our trajectory on shrink. We think that the work that's been done over the last 12 to 18 months has some legs to it. And we're seeing it broad-based, as we indicated, across many, many categories. So we feel pretty good. But as you look, just to keep in mind, gross margins, the headwinds get a little bit tougher and the laps get a little tougher as we move through the quarter -- sorry, through the rest of the year and into the upcoming quarter. So keep that in mind as you take a look at that.\n\n---\n\nCongrats to everybody on the new roles and moving on. I want to talk a little bit more about the labor investment that you're making. Can you give us some sense of the economic return that you've seen from the test? And how scalable you think that the return will be and what form it will be? Is it mostly going to be a sales lift?\n\n---\n\nYes, Michael, it's Todd once again. I think the best way to look at it is that, our operations teams have a real defined metric goal that they need to reach. And as we indicated, it is goals around sales being the #1 driver. The whole thought around this is to make sure that our in-store experience for the consumer is top-notch as she enters our stores. And as we've said for the last couple of calls, this labor investment at store level is about getting product on the shelf, about getting out of the back room and getting the truck work in a more timely manner, so that as the consumer enters the store, she has what she needs on the shelf at the time she needs it and can get out of the store quickly. So there definitely is metrics involved and we're pretty pleased with what we see so far. But again, it's early. But we're pretty pleased and look forward to rolling out Phases 2 and 3 of the program as we work through the rest of the year.\n\n---\n\nAnd so should we -- I appreciate your commentary about the comparisons getting tougher, but with the labor investment, should we expect that some of the comparison will be mitigated by the sales lift that you anticipate you'll achieve through this initiative?\n\n---\n\nYes, and I think that's fair to say. But again, we knew going into the year as we laid our guidance, we've layered that in as being a benefit for us. But I think might be you're exactly right. It's fair to say that, that should help us as we move into the back half of the year.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then my last question, Todd, is you mentioned some headwinds that you're going to be facing, aside from tough compares on the gross margin side. What exactly are you referring to on the gross margin headwinds? And so should we, should not expect that the 45 basis points of expansion is necessarily achievable -- sustainable?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think the way to look at it is one, we're fairly confident that we will have expansion for the year. But as we continue to move throughout the year, the compares get a little tougher to last year and that rate of growth with gross margin will subside somewhat as we continue to move. But we feel pretty confident that we'll have expansion as we move through the rest of the year.\n\n---\n\nSo on the top line, this 3% to 3.5% same-store sales guidance for the year, it appears prudent, given the tougher compares as the year progresses. My question, have you baked in any changes in macro backdrop with some of the wage increases? And then from a category perspective, what areas of the store would you expect to outpace that guide over the next 12 months?\n\n---\n\nWell, as we look at it, we really haven't factored anything for the wages and we watch all trends in retail, and wages being one of them, and I think we've got a pretty strong track record of doing what we need to do at the time we need to do it. And the nice thing about Dollar General is we have the flexibility to be able to do that. So we feel pretty confident in that. But we'll watch it. And as we look at sales as we move through the rest of the year, the work that the teams have done in non-consumables, I have to tell you, we feel very good about that. And again, that work has been ongoing for years, Matt, as you know. And as we've always said, as the consumer starts to have a little bit more money, we think that we've got the right formula for her on non-consumables. So we still consider non-consumables as a great rounding out of the basket. And I think Q1 showed that. And I think as we move through the rest of the year, our non-consumable categories will continue to perform very well for us.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And then can you just talk about what you're seeing in the competitive environment? And particularly any changes that you've noticed with some of your peers currently under transition today?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think the -- when you look at the macro environment out there in retail, it's always very competitive. But I think the best way to still characterize it is it's been very rational across all channels of trade, mass, grocery and drug. And we watch, just like everyone, we watch everything everyone's doing and we'll act accordingly. But I have to tell you, at this point, we really haven't seen anything that is out of the ordinary. But we're doing -- and we're doing things and we're controlling what we can control and working our plan. And where we think the year is going to fall out and that's where we're squarely focused. And if we keep our head down and do that, and then also watch what's going on around us, I think we're going to have a pretty good year here.\n\n---\n\nTwo questions. First of all, you've made a couple of comments just regarding in-stock levels and one of the reasons you're increasing the labor investment is to improve the in-stock level to make sure the stores are prepared. so I guess the question is, do you think you've had an issue with in-stock levels, first? And then second, just kind of, again, this is a broader macro question, I guess, but a lot of the data out there suggests that blue collar labor trends continue to improve. We're starting to see some upward pressure on wages, which I would think would create a good environment for Dollar General. I'm wondering how you would characterize the health of your core consumer at this point?\n\n---\n\nSure. Scot, I think it's fair to say, on the in-stock piece, that we haven't been fully satisfied with where our in-stocks have been and been trending. In saying that, I think we've done some very prudent things and taken some actions, as you heard in my prepared remarks, to offset some of those in-stock issues that we've seen start to pop up over the last 12 to 18 months. Now in saying that, we've got a lot of things in place to make sure that our in-stock levels are appropriate. But as you can tell, we do have some opportunities still. So we're working that plan and stay tuned for more information as we continue to move through the year on it. But we're confident that we'll be able to reel that in and get our in-stocks back to where we think they should be. As it relates to our core consumer, I think you nailed it. I think that the consumer is feeling a little bit better. But again, our core consumer is always a little bit stretched. And as you know, she is the first, usually, to start to feel it, when the economy starts to go a little sideways and she's also the last to usually roll out of that, when she starts to go back to work and things start to get a little better. But I think the way to look at it is that she also has to feel confident over a longer period of time. And I think as we continue to move through the year and if everything stays where it's at or gets a little bit better, her confidence level is going to build and her spending will probably build with that. Because again, she is -- she doesn't have a lot of disposable income, she doesn't have bank accounts and credit cards. And so she has to see a sustained time where she starts to feel good and once that happens, I think you'll start to see her spend a little bit more.\n\n---\n\nAnd congratulations to both of you, Rick and Todd. My question was a follow-up on this labor investment. Can you just remind us how many stores were in the test? How many that were on Phase 1? And then considering the investments you're making where we...\n\n---\n\nDan, did we lose you?\r\n[Technical Difficulty]\n\n---\n\nOn the 2014 labor initiatives, I don't know if it was really his question actually, but on the 2014 test that you did, can you just give us some perspective on how many stores that you tested it in and what the degree of improvement was in your in-stock levels, and also from a sales perspective, what the lift was?\n\n---\n\nYes, when we rolled out the 2014 test, Chuck, I think it's fair to say it was a done in a pretty big group of stores and it was done across a lot of different geographic areas of the country to make sure that we felt good about the results that were coming out of it. So in our test and learn program, as you know, using APT, we have the unique ability to be able to really focus in on that. And then glean the learnings from it. So it was broad based in a lot of different geographic areas, but I think the biggest thing to take away was that we saw significant sales increases that were sustainable. And as well as our in-stock positions had increased. And what we're waiting for to come through on this as well, that will be a trailer to both the '14 test and anything we do in '15, we're hoping to get some shrink goodness out of this as we continue to move as well. But again, that will be yet to come and we won't probably recognize that until later this year and into early next year.\n\n---\n\nOkay, great. And then just to dovetail into that, David, when we think about SG&A dollar growth in the balance of the year, 9.5% here in the first quarter, should we think about that rising as we roll out the labor initiatives to more stores?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think as we look at it, we still believe it takes approximately a 3.5% comp on an ongoing basis to lever our SG&A. Now having said that, that ebbs and flows and it depends upon what our investments in, in a particular quarter, and obviously, we were a little higher in Q1 on incentive comp, advertising and repairs and maintenance. And yes, as we go through the back half of the year, we will be making some investments in labor that will reduce the leverage in terms of how much we can lever SG&A. And as Todd said, we think that's a great investment, but it takes a little bit of time to get that payback as customers, obviously, the hope is we'll get more transactions and a bigger basket as customer -- customers come into the store and that will come over time. So again, big expectations for it. But as we're implementing it, the back half of the year puts a little pressure on SG&A.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Great. And then one more for you David, just on the cash flow statement, it looks like you had some help on the payables front, an increase from the end of the year, when it looks like typically over the past few years, you guys see a decline. Just wondering why the payable balance rose so much.\n\n---\n\nYes, 2 things there. Last year, on payables, we had a little bit of a negative and this year, we had a little bit of a positive, the same items, that had to do with the receipts. And we talked about the West Coast situation and this year, we got a whole slug of receipts in rather late in the quarter that we didn't have to pay for right away and last year, we got receipts a little bit earlier that we paid for a little quicker. So a little bit of hurt last year and a little bit of help this year. Put them together, it was an enough to, as you say, kind of stick out of the cash flow statement.\n\n---\n\nOkay, great. And congrats on your retirement.\n\n---\n\nThank you.\n\n---\n\nAnyway, so I did have some other questions, though. You recently opened your 12,000th store. Maybe you can give us a little bit of an update based on kind of the white space and the opportunities, competitive environment, what you think the opportunity is for Dollar General here?\n\n---\n\nYes, we think the opportunity is very bright. We've stated that we've got 13,000 opportunities that exist in the continental United States. We know we'll get our very fair share of those. As a matter of fact, as we've already announced, we've accelerated our growth to ensure that we get the very best sites that are out there. So we feel very good about the white spaces there still. And we feel good about the new states that we've entered and where those sales trends are moving. So all in all, the future is pretty bright when you look at store -- building stores and store expansion and our future expansion plans.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then just one other question. On -- you talked about better in-stock levels. I'm not sure if you want to quantify, but what is sort of the ideal economical level of in-stocks that you think you want to be at longer term? And maybe if you could also include in that conversation how much of the inventory is being pushed to the stores versus pulled? Is it all central replenishment? Or do they have -- do store managers have some flexibility to request product, too?\n\n---\n\nYes, those are good questions. And when we look at inventory levels, there is no doubt that we do have specific goals in mind by category and even down to the goods themselves. So in our top 250 items, we want 99%-plus in-stocks. And as you go down the food chain, if you will, on items, that expectation becomes a little less because we know that we're not -- we wouldn't want to be 99% in-stock across the board. But in saying that, our consumers expect a very high level of in-stock when they come into the store. And we feel that by making sure that we've got the product on the shelf and again, implementing the sky shelf program as I indicated, will help keep that -- those goods out of the back room and customer-facing. So those are some of the initiatives we're working on to make sure that those in-stock levels stay pretty high. And then when you look at just overall, our inventory, we feel that it's pretty clean and we feel good about it.\n\n---\n\nTodd, I wanted to ask you about your thoughts on private label opportunities. So when we look at competitors such as Aldi, obviously, remarkably successful, with almost 100% private brand assortment. And I'm assuming that Family Dollar's private label assortment will grow once it becomes a part of Dollar Tree. So when you think about Dollar General, do you see an opportunity to further push your private label penetration higher? Or do you think just the opposite, to differentiate yourself from those competitors, perhaps, focus more on branded product?\n\n---\n\nYes, those are good questions. We very much love private brands. We know that they are definitely a pillar of our inventory that we have. As a matter of fact, our consumers look to us for a great alternative in private brand. So to answer your question specifically, we look to continue to expand our private brands, not only the items, but also the quality that we put forward to the consumer. And we also want to make sure that it's an extreme value for our consumer. The other lever that we have that we continue to expand and you'll see a further expansion as we go through '15, will be our Smart & Simple label, which in fact gets us to even a lower price point for our customer, to really hit that affordability piece that she craves right now, especially in a lot of the consumable type areas. So we're bullish about our private brand program and you'll continue to see us move forward and expand that as we move into the latter part of this year and to next.\n\n---\n\nAnd just, Todd, one follow-up question, with the 900 stores opening next year, I don't think a retailer has ever opened that many stores in a year, is it your experience that Dollar General finds that first-year volumes are greater when you're the first small box value retailer in a market? Is that the key reason why you're pushing the expansion rate higher?\n\n---\n\nYes, the way we look at it is, first of all, 900 stores is a big number, but our real estate team is very, very good at what they do. We're confident in the site selection and that's probably the most important thing around volume, is getting the right site and our proprietary tools that we use really hones in those sites for us and enables us to get there. Now there is no doubt that being first-mover does give you some advantage. And we'll continue to capitalize on any dislocation that may be out there. But 900 stores is aggressive, but we feel very confident in delivering that.\n\n---\n\nI think you touched upon personalizing promotions. I'm just curious how far away are you from being able to do that? And are you partnering with anyone on the data analytics?\n\n---\n\nTo answer your question specifically, we were already doing targeted marketing based on purchase habits from our consumers on that card. Again, the beauty of this is it looks and feels like a loyalty card, but it has none of that backstage cost that is very prohibitive out there. So we are partnering with many of the CPG companies, and quite frankly, the majority of them are very, very excited about partnering with us to offer our consumers a real deal on these digital coupon platforms. But what they're even more jazzed about, if you will, is the ability to seed them, based on their purchase history, with coupons that are very relevant to them. And we're pretty happy with the early results of it, and you're going to see a lot more from us as we move over the next few quarters.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And just another one about operating profits. I think it grew about 13% in the quarter. Your guidance is 7% to 9% for the year. I know there's some comparisons in the back half of the year. I'm wondering, is there some conservatism built into that as well? And how much of it is from labor investments incrementally stepping up? Just wondering if you could help us through the puts and takes on margins over the course of the year?\n\n---\n\nYes, well, clearly, it is early in the year. We've only been through one quarter and as you said, the comparisons do get a little more difficult as we get in the second half the year. So I think let's just stay tuned on that one and we'll see how it all plays out. We are making more investment in labor as we go through the year, talked about that. And again, we believe we'll have a great return on that. It's just going to take a little while for us to get that return.\n\n---\n\nAnd last one for me, I'm just wondering if you could talk about direct sourcing as an opportunity in 2015, just an update there?\n\n---\n\nYes, again, direct sourcing is one of our key pillars of gross margin and gross margin expansion, but also offers our consumers a real value and affordability in that sweet spot of $1 to $5. So we want to continue and we will continue to grow our global sourcing efforts. And as we move through 2015 and into next year, we continue to put satellite offices in more countries around the globe to make sure that we have boots on the street and really finding the next best factories that can deliver that promise to the consumer. So we're full speed ahead on global sourcing.\n\n---\n\nFirst, I'm wondering if you can give us any read, early read, on the repackaging of your private brands. I think the goal was to have most of those in store by mid-year. And I'm wondering if you're getting any sales lift from that?\n\n---\n\nYes, Matt, as we look at the private brand repackaging and just the effort, in general, it's way early to give a real solid read on it. But I can tell you that half of the goods that we repackaged by about mid-year, and then the remainder 90% will be done probably by the end of the second and into the early third quarter. But the early read has been fairly positive. When we look at it, we are looking at it by item, by category. And there are a few changes that we've made already based on that. But overall, the consumer response has been very positive. And again, we did a lot, which we always do, a lot of consumer work before we launched each and every one of those items. So we had a real good idea of what it would do and it's coming very, very close to what we thought. But just like anything, there's always a little bit of back-and-forth that we need to do and a few items that we're changing as we speak.\n\n---\n\nGot it, okay. And then on a separate topic, the digital coupon platform, can you give us a sense for how many of your customers have signed up for that or maybe the percent of baskets that are using a digital coupon? Just so we can kind of gauge the size of that -- that effort right now?\n\n---\n\nWe really, Matt, haven't quantified that. But I could tell you that we've got goals and metrics in place to hit and we are on actually exceeding those sign-ups already through Q1 and now as we go into Q2. And as you heard, we're launching different programs in each quarter to encourage sign-up and to get people really involved in it. So stay tuned, more to come on that, because it's in its infancy stage, but we think it's a real differentiator for our channel.\n\n---\n\nOkay. That's fair. And then just lastly, on the sky shelf initiative, is that more about the flow of inventory through the store, or adding safety stock to the store? And if it's the latter, how does that impact inventory dollars per store over time?\n\n---\n\nYes, Matt, it really is the first. And that is, it facilitates getting product out of that back room and getting it right in front of the customer. Our store teams do a fabulous job day in and day out taking care of our customers. We want to make it easier for them. And the easiest way to stock the goods on the shelf would not be to go back in the back room and have to find it, but to be able to look right above the items and be able to stock it very effectively and efficiently that way. And that was really the impetus behind us doing that, was to make it easier on the stores. Now the byproduct of that is better in-stocks, because once again, if you see an aisle and you happen to be passing by the aisles, you may not have time in the way we did it in the past, to run in the back room to get the item, but you know what, you definitely have time to stop for a few seconds, look up and if it's there, pull a few down and put it on the shelf. So I think it's going to kill 2 birds with one stone and make things a lot easier for the stores, but also be able to enhance our in-stock position.\n\n---\n\nIf anything, from a working capital point of view, it should reduce working capital, because it will be out there, you'll get it on the shelf quicker, it will sell quicker, and it should, in no way, will it add inventory. It's just being more efficient with the inventory and actually, hopefully, making it turn even quicker.\n\n---\n\nMakes a lot of sense. Todd, congrats on your new role.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Matt.\n\n---\n\nI wanted to follow up on corporate brand topic. So how satisfied do you think you are with corporate brand pricing, particularly versus the hard discounters? And then with Smart & Simple, how much do you think -- will there be a Smart & Simple alternative in every category and subcategory? And if so, where do you get the shelf space for that, is that national brand or more facings?\n\n---\n\nJohn, a couple of good questions. Number one, we look at pricing, whether it's national brand or private brand, across the entire spectrum of where we do business, every 2 weeks. So we're very, very attuned to pricing. And we feel pretty confident on both our national brand, but especially our private brand pricing, as it relates to mass grocery and drug. Now in saying that, well, we continue to watch pricing as national brands get -- may get more aggressive. We also then make sure that we watch our spreads between national brand and private brands. And at those times, we'll reduce our prices if need be to keep those spreads. But as you look at our private brands and the way that we're looking at them, Smart & Simple does play a key role in that affordability piece. And I wouldn't say that we're going to have it in every single category. But I can tell you that right now, the 45 or 50 items that we launched this year or late last year and into this year, has been very, very good for us. The consumer has -- has resonated with the consumer. They like the value and the affordability that Smart & Simple offers, with a pretty good promise on the quality of the item. So stay tuned, John. I think you're going to see an acceleration of Smart & Simple as we go forward, because we know that it's a true differentiator for us, but also it really helps the consumer.\n\n---\n\nAnd then lastly, as a follow-up, if you think about -- I mean, your share is still very small in any of your categories. Where is the best opportunity to drive, think beyond 2015, investing in more labor investing and price, is there enough elasticity if you invest in price to drive some of that share? How do you look at the 2 versus each other?\n\n---\n\nWell, we look at both all the time. And we look at the marketplace all the time. And I think you know us pretty well. If we feel that we need to invest in labor, we do. If we feel like we need to invest in price, we do. The real key, and we've said it many, many times, is driving units. If we drive units through the store and those transactions, then comps sales come. So we're confident in that model and the nice thing is we have the flexibility, and we've proven that over time, to be able to take whatever action we need to take to make sure that we continue to drive market share. And by the way, our market share continues to grow, as you heard, and we don't see that stopping, because we've got a real good strong category management plan out there that will leverage up on a lot of different areas to be able to drive that market share.\n\n---\n\nThis is actually just a follow-up on an earlier comment on the non-consumables. Can you just provide a little more detail on what has changed in apparel, specifically to drive the better results and maybe what are some of the ongoing initiatives that will continue to be benefiting this part of the mix?\n\n---\n\nYes, that's a great question. A few things, and we've been working on apparel for many years, but Cindy Long and her team have done a phenomenal job in getting this very, very relevant in apparel. And when we look at apparel, it's both basics and then fashion basics. We're not out there on the cutting-edge of fashion, but fashion basics is really where Cindy and her team have brought us. And the consumer is really resonating. And then as we took her learnings from that, and then put in the affordability pieces that we've now ingrained within our category management process to include apparel, the consumers have really, really responded to that. So we are -- we're pretty bullish on apparel. I don't think any of us would have probably said that a few years ago. But I can tell you that the team has done some real nice work there and we see that only enhancing as we continue to move through the rest of this year.\n\n---\n\nGreat, that's helpful. And then maybe changing gears. I realize oftentimes you don't comment on these specifically, but can you just talk to your thought process more generally about evaluating acquisitions?\n\n---\n\nWe've always said, and David can also chime in here. We'll look at anything that may be out there. But the great thing about our model is that, and you've heard me a little earlier, we've got 13,000 or so opportunities in the continental United States alone. So we're very, very focused on that organic growth right now. But never say never. And we're always going to look at everything. But we feel very confident in our real estate model and where we're headed right now.\n\n---\n\nThanks, best of luck in the new role.\n\n---\n\nThank you.\n\n---\n\nAnd so I guess my question is more as we look out. I mean, obviously, this year is going kind of on plan and maybe even a little bit better. But as we move out to next year and we talk about the labor investments, got another competitor of yours now upping the starting salaries to $10, so it's going to put some probably further pressure on that labor line. Plus the 900 stores, it just seems as I kind of look at '17, it looks a little harder from my perspective. And I wanted you to talk me out of that.\n\n---\n\nYes, I think it's fair to say that we've got a very, very strong plan that we're executing against for this year. We've already laid plans for 2016. Stay tuned. I think you're going to be pretty happy as we continue to move through this. We've proven that we can continue to move comp sales. We've proven that we can continue to balance the P&L pretty strong and still return a lot to the shareholders. And I think that you're going to continue to see that from us. But -- and as it relates to the wages, we're continuing to monitor that. We monitor everything out there in retail and wages are no different. But keep in mind, we still have a lot of flexibility. And the real hallmark of a great retailer is the ability to drive productivity at store level and we'll continue to do that. And if we can continue to do that, it will afford us that flexibility to do whatever we need to do to be competitive.\n\n---\n\nAnd then just one follow-up. I noticed -- I think your rent growth is close to 15% last year. As we accelerate the stores, and obviously, we're at the kind of tail end of the -- it looks like economic cycle, at least more at the end, how is rent growth? How should we think about rent growth going forward? Is it harder to get space as you're paying more? Or no?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think, and again, we don't give specific guidance on individual line items, but we have an extremely sophisticated, effective real estate process, as Todd mentioned earlier, and we're very pleased with what we see out of that. We believe we're getting the lowest rent possible for somebody in our space. We're happy with what we're driving there. And again, it's all about productivity in the box. As we look at the individual boxes, if we're dealing with a little higher rent, then we've got to figure out how to make that box more productive to pay for that rent. And again, I think we've got a lot of programs to do that, also. So it's just part of the evolution of our model as we move forward. And I think we've got a lot of strategies to help offset those higher rents.\n\n---\n\nThank you. I know we're leaving some people in the queue, so I apologize about that, but Matt Hancock and I will be around to take any calls. So please feel free to give me a call, and thank you for joining us today.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Paul Trussell (Analysts)】\nAnd congrats, Todd, and also congrats to you on the successful transition, Rick -- Rick and David.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nThank you.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Trussell (Analysts)】\nSo just want to talk about cadence. Rick, you spoke to being pleased with the sales cadence. Could you please help us understand how you started and ended the period from a same-store sales standpoint and quantify any impact from any one-off headwinds, such as the earlier Easter, whether there was an impact, note that's notable from weather or West Coast ports? And also, on sales, David reiterated the guidance regarding the first half better than the second half. Just any other color as we should be thinking about the second quarter trend to-date would be helpful.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Todd Vasos (Executives)】\nYes, Paul, this is Todd, let me first say that the first quarter sales trajectory and trend were pretty much exactly like we thought they would be. Obviously, we knew the calendar. We knew that the Easter shift would play a key factor in how the quarter shaped up and it played out exactly the way we really thought it would and that was benefiting period 2 of the quarter and then taken away some sales in period 3. So the quarter shaped up pretty much like we thought. There was some headwind, as you indicated, with a little weather that we saw, just like everyone else, I'm sure, in that latter part of February, early March time frame. But as that subsided and mitigated, our sales returned to a more normalized pattern and again, where we thought. And as we look forward, Paul, we're pretty satisfied and confident in our guidance of sales that we put out at the beginning of the year. So I think the best way to look at it is that we're well on track to be within that guidance.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Trussell (Analysts)】\nNow on gross margins, very good performance there, could you give a little bit more detail on what is driving the higher mark-ups? And are there any headwinds that we should be thinking about going forward that could offset some of the improvement in shrink and lower transportation cost?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Todd Vasos (Executives)】\nPaul, we're very pleased with our gross margin performance. I think the teams did an outstanding job and to call out a few of the teams in supply chain and merchandising in particular, they did a real good job in mitigating some of that West Coast issue that we were facing and they did it over a course of a long period of time. As they saw this start to materialize, they made some very early changes late last year to move some goods to the East Coast, and that really helped us. Then as we looked at the quarter, the mix really did benefit us. And as you heard from the prepared remarks, we were very happy with our sales and our sales trajectories in non-consumables. And so as you look at the non-consumable piece, it helped our margin as we looked year-over-year. DC and trans did a nice job, as I indicated, not only on the West Coast piece, but also, they continue working their productivity gains within the DCs, as well as looking at how we mitigate any issues with some of the driver shortages that have been out there. Again, our teams, I think, have done a pretty good job with that. And of course, fuel helped a little bit, as it is much lower than last year. And then lastly, we're very, very encouraged by our shrink results and our trajectory on shrink. We think that the work that's been done over the last 12 to 18 months has some legs to it. And we're seeing it broad-based, as we indicated, across many, many categories. So we feel pretty good. But as you look, just to keep in mind, gross margins, the headwinds get a little bit tougher and the laps get a little tougher as we move through the quarter -- sorry, through the rest of the year and into the upcoming quarter. So keep that in mind as you take a look at that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Lasser (Analysts)】\nCongrats to everybody on the new roles and moving on. I want to talk a little bit more about the labor investment that you're making. Can you give us some sense of the economic return that you've seen from the test? And how scalable you think that the return will be and what form it will be? Is it mostly going to be a sales lift?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Todd Vasos (Executives)】\nYes, Michael, it's Todd once again. I think the best way to look at it is that, our operations teams have a real defined metric goal that they need to reach. And as we indicated, it is goals around sales being the #1 driver. The whole thought around this is to make sure that our in-store experience for the consumer is top-notch as she enters our stores. And as we've said for the last couple of calls, this labor investment at store level is about getting product on the shelf, about getting out of the back room and getting the truck work in a more timely manner, so that as the consumer enters the store, she has what she needs on the shelf at the time she needs it and can get out of the store quickly. So there definitely is metrics involved and we're pretty pleased with what we see so far. But again, it's early. But we're pretty pleased and look forward to rolling out Phases 2 and 3 of the program as we work through the rest of the year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Lasser (Analysts)】\nAnd so should we -- I appreciate your commentary about the comparisons getting tougher, but with the labor investment, should we expect that some of the comparison will be mitigated by the sales lift that you anticipate you'll achieve through this initiative?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Todd Vasos (Executives)】\nYes, and I think that's fair to say. But again, we knew going into the year as we laid our guidance, we've layered that in as being a benefit for us. But I think might be you're exactly right. It's fair to say that, that should help us as we move into the back half of the year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Lasser (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then my last question, Todd, is you mentioned some headwinds that you're going to be facing, aside from tough compares on the gross margin side. What exactly are you referring to on the gross margin headwinds? And so should we, should not expect that the 45 basis points of expansion is necessarily achievable -- sustainable?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Todd Vasos (Executives)】\nYes, I think the way to look at it is one, we're fairly confident that we will have expansion for the year. But as we continue to move throughout the year, the compares get a little tougher to last year and that rate of growth with gross margin will subside somewhat as we continue to move. But we feel pretty confident that we'll have expansion as we move through the rest of the year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matthew Boss (Analysts)】\nSo on the top line, this 3% to 3.5% same-store sales guidance for the year, it appears prudent, given the tougher compares as the year progresses. My question, have you baked in any changes in macro backdrop with some of the wage increases? And then from a category perspective, what areas of the store would you expect to outpace that guide over the next 12 months?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Todd Vasos (Executives)】\nWell, as we look at it, we really haven't factored anything for the wages and we watch all trends in retail, and wages being one of them, and I think we've got a pretty strong track record of doing what we need to do at the time we need to do it. And the nice thing about Dollar General is we have the flexibility to be able to do that. So we feel pretty confident in that. But we'll watch it. And as we look at sales as we move through the rest of the year, the work that the teams have done in non-consumables, I have to tell you, we feel very good about that. And again, that work has been ongoing for years, Matt, as you know. And as we've always said, as the consumer starts to have a little bit more money, we think that we've got the right formula for her on non-consumables. So we still consider non-consumables as a great rounding out of the basket. And I think Q1 showed that. And I think as we move through the rest of the year, our non-consumable categories will continue to perform very well for us.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matthew Boss (Analysts)】\nGreat. And then can you just talk about what you're seeing in the competitive environment? And particularly any changes that you've noticed with some of your peers currently under transition today?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Todd Vasos (Executives)】\nYes, I think the -- when you look at the macro environment out there in retail, it's always very competitive. But I think the best way to still characterize it is it's been very rational across all channels of trade, mass, grocery and drug. And we watch, just like everyone, we watch everything everyone's doing and we'll act accordingly. But I have to tell you, at this point, we really haven't seen anything that is out of the ordinary. But we're doing -- and we're doing things and we're controlling what we can control and working our plan. And where we think the year is going to fall out and that's where we're squarely focused. And if we keep our head down and do that, and then also watch what's going on around us, I think we're going to have a pretty good year here.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scot Ciccarelli (Analysts)】\nTwo questions. First of all, you've made a couple of comments just regarding in-stock levels and one of the reasons you're increasing the labor investment is to improve the in-stock level to make sure the stores are prepared. so I guess the question is, do you think you've had an issue with in-stock levels, first? And then second, just kind of, again, this is a broader macro question, I guess, but a lot of the data out there suggests that blue collar labor trends continue to improve. We're starting to see some upward pressure on wages, which I would think would create a good environment for Dollar General. I'm wondering how you would characterize the health of your core consumer at this point?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Todd Vasos (Executives)】\nSure. Scot, I think it's fair to say, on the in-stock piece, that we haven't been fully satisfied with where our in-stocks have been and been trending. In saying that, I think we've done some very prudent things and taken some actions, as you heard in my prepared remarks, to offset some of those in-stock issues that we've seen start to pop up over the last 12 to 18 months. Now in saying that, we've got a lot of things in place to make sure that our in-stock levels are appropriate. But as you can tell, we do have some opportunities still. So we're working that plan and stay tuned for more information as we continue to move through the year on it. But we're confident that we'll be able to reel that in and get our in-stocks back to where we think they should be. As it relates to our core consumer, I think you nailed it. I think that the consumer is feeling a little bit better. But again, our core consumer is always a little bit stretched. And as you know, she is the first, usually, to start to feel it, when the economy starts to go a little sideways and she's also the last to usually roll out of that, when she starts to go back to work and things start to get a little better. But I think the way to look at it is that she also has to feel confident over a longer period of time. And I think as we continue to move through the year and if everything stays where it's at or gets a little bit better, her confidence level is going to build and her spending will probably build with that. Because again, she is -- she doesn't have a lot of disposable income, she doesn't have bank accounts and credit cards. And so she has to see a sustained time where she starts to feel good and once that happens, I think you'll start to see her spend a little bit more.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Binder (Analysts)】\nAnd congratulations to both of you, Rick and Todd. My question was a follow-up on this labor investment. Can you just remind us how many stores were in the test? How many that were on Phase 1? And then considering the investments you're making where we...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mary Winn Pilkington (Executives)】\nDan, did we lose you?\r\n[Technical Difficulty]\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Grom (Analysts)】\nOn the 2014 labor initiatives, I don't know if it was really his question actually, but on the 2014 test that you did, can you just give us some perspective on how many stores that you tested it in and what the degree of improvement was in your in-stock levels, and also from a sales perspective, what the lift was?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Todd Vasos (Executives)】\nYes, when we rolled out the 2014 test, Chuck, I think it's fair to say it was a done in a pretty big group of stores and it was done across a lot of different geographic areas of the country to make sure that we felt good about the results that were coming out of it. So in our test and learn program, as you know, using APT, we have the unique ability to be able to really focus in on that. And then glean the learnings from it. So it was broad based in a lot of different geographic areas, but I think the biggest thing to take away was that we saw significant sales increases that were sustainable. And as well as our in-stock positions had increased. And what we're waiting for to come through on this as well, that will be a trailer to both the '14 test and anything we do in '15, we're hoping to get some shrink goodness out of this as we continue to move as well. But again, that will be yet to come and we won't probably recognize that until later this year and into early next year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Grom (Analysts)】\nOkay, great. And then just to dovetail into that, David, when we think about SG&A dollar growth in the balance of the year, 9.5% here in the first quarter, should we think about that rising as we roll out the labor initiatives to more stores?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Tehle (Executives)】\nYes, I think as we look at it, we still believe it takes approximately a 3.5% comp on an ongoing basis to lever our SG&A. Now having said that, that ebbs and flows and it depends upon what our investments in, in a particular quarter, and obviously, we were a little higher in Q1 on incentive comp, advertising and repairs and maintenance. And yes, as we go through the back half of the year, we will be making some investments in labor that will reduce the leverage in terms of how much we can lever SG&A. And as Todd said, we think that's a great investment, but it takes a little bit of time to get that payback as customers, obviously, the hope is we'll get more transactions and a bigger basket as customer -- customers come into the store and that will come over time. So again, big expectations for it. But as we're implementing it, the back half of the year puts a little pressure on SG&A.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Grom (Analysts)】\nOkay. Great. And then one more for you David, just on the cash flow statement, it looks like you had some help on the payables front, an increase from the end of the year, when it looks like typically over the past few years, you guys see a decline. Just wondering why the payable balance rose so much.\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Tehle (Executives)】\nYes, 2 things there. Last year, on payables, we had a little bit of a negative and this year, we had a little bit of a positive, the same items, that had to do with the receipts. And we talked about the West Coast situation and this year, we got a whole slug of receipts in rather late in the quarter that we didn't have to pay for right away and last year, we got receipts a little bit earlier that we paid for a little quicker. So a little bit of hurt last year and a little bit of help this year. Put them together, it was an enough to, as you say, kind of stick out of the cash flow statement.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Grom (Analysts)】\nOkay, great. And congrats on your retirement.\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Tehle (Executives)】\nThank you.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Binder (Analysts)】\nAnyway, so I did have some other questions, though. You recently opened your 12,000th store. Maybe you can give us a little bit of an update based on kind of the white space and the opportunities, competitive environment, what you think the opportunity is for Dollar General here?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Todd Vasos (Executives)】\nYes, we think the opportunity is very bright. We've stated that we've got 13,000 opportunities that exist in the continental United States. We know we'll get our very fair share of those. As a matter of fact, as we've already announced, we've accelerated our growth to ensure that we get the very best sites that are out there. So we feel very good about the white spaces there still. And we feel good about the new states that we've entered and where those sales trends are moving. So all in all, the future is pretty bright when you look at store -- building stores and store expansion and our future expansion plans.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Binder (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then just one other question. On -- you talked about better in-stock levels. I'm not sure if you want to quantify, but what is sort of the ideal economical level of in-stocks that you think you want to be at longer term? And maybe if you could also include in that conversation how much of the inventory is being pushed to the stores versus pulled? Is it all central replenishment? Or do they have -- do store managers have some flexibility to request product, too?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Todd Vasos (Executives)】\nYes, those are good questions. And when we look at inventory levels, there is no doubt that we do have specific goals in mind by category and even down to the goods themselves. So in our top 250 items, we want 99%-plus in-stocks. And as you go down the food chain, if you will, on items, that expectation becomes a little less because we know that we're not -- we wouldn't want to be 99% in-stock across the board. But in saying that, our consumers expect a very high level of in-stock when they come into the store. And we feel that by making sure that we've got the product on the shelf and again, implementing the sky shelf program as I indicated, will help keep that -- those goods out of the back room and customer-facing. So those are some of the initiatives we're working on to make sure that those in-stock levels stay pretty high. And then when you look at just overall, our inventory, we feel that it's pretty clean and we feel good about it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Wewer (Analysts)】\nTodd, I wanted to ask you about your thoughts on private label opportunities. So when we look at competitors such as Aldi, obviously, remarkably successful, with almost 100% private brand assortment. And I'm assuming that Family Dollar's private label assortment will grow once it becomes a part of Dollar Tree. So when you think about Dollar General, do you see an opportunity to further push your private label penetration higher? Or do you think just the opposite, to differentiate yourself from those competitors, perhaps, focus more on branded product?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Todd Vasos (Executives)】\nYes, those are good questions. We very much love private brands. We know that they are definitely a pillar of our inventory that we have. As a matter of fact, our consumers look to us for a great alternative in private brand. So to answer your question specifically, we look to continue to expand our private brands, not only the items, but also the quality that we put forward to the consumer. And we also want to make sure that it's an extreme value for our consumer. The other lever that we have that we continue to expand and you'll see a further expansion as we go through '15, will be our Smart & Simple label, which in fact gets us to even a lower price point for our customer, to really hit that affordability piece that she craves right now, especially in a lot of the consumable type areas. So we're bullish about our private brand program and you'll continue to see us move forward and expand that as we move into the latter part of this year and to next.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Wewer (Analysts)】\nAnd just, Todd, one follow-up question, with the 900 stores opening next year, I don't think a retailer has ever opened that many stores in a year, is it your experience that Dollar General finds that first-year volumes are greater when you're the first small box value retailer in a market? Is that the key reason why you're pushing the expansion rate higher?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Todd Vasos (Executives)】\nYes, the way we look at it is, first of all, 900 stores is a big number, but our real estate team is very, very good at what they do. We're confident in the site selection and that's probably the most important thing around volume, is getting the right site and our proprietary tools that we use really hones in those sites for us and enables us to get there. Now there is no doubt that being first-mover does give you some advantage. And we'll continue to capitalize on any dislocation that may be out there. But 900 stores is aggressive, but we feel very confident in delivering that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Alvin Concepcion (Analysts)】\nI think you touched upon personalizing promotions. I'm just curious how far away are you from being able to do that? And are you partnering with anyone on the data analytics?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Todd Vasos (Executives)】\nTo answer your question specifically, we were already doing targeted marketing based on purchase habits from our consumers on that card. Again, the beauty of this is it looks and feels like a loyalty card, but it has none of that backstage cost that is very prohibitive out there. So we are partnering with many of the CPG companies, and quite frankly, the majority of them are very, very excited about partnering with us to offer our consumers a real deal on these digital coupon platforms. But what they're even more jazzed about, if you will, is the ability to seed them, based on their purchase history, with coupons that are very relevant to them. And we're pretty happy with the early results of it, and you're going to see a lot more from us as we move over the next few quarters.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Alvin Concepcion (Analysts)】\nGreat. And just another one about operating profits. I think it grew about 13% in the quarter. Your guidance is 7% to 9% for the year. I know there's some comparisons in the back half of the year. I'm wondering, is there some conservatism built into that as well? And how much of it is from labor investments incrementally stepping up? Just wondering if you could help us through the puts and takes on margins over the course of the year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Tehle (Executives)】\nYes, well, clearly, it is early in the year. We've only been through one quarter and as you said, the comparisons do get a little more difficult as we get in the second half the year. So I think let's just stay tuned on that one and we'll see how it all plays out. We are making more investment in labor as we go through the year, talked about that. And again, we believe we'll have a great return on that. It's just going to take a little while for us to get that return.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Alvin Concepcion (Analysts)】\nAnd last one for me, I'm just wondering if you could talk about direct sourcing as an opportunity in 2015, just an update there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Todd Vasos (Executives)】\nYes, again, direct sourcing is one of our key pillars of gross margin and gross margin expansion, but also offers our consumers a real value and affordability in that sweet spot of $1 to $5. So we want to continue and we will continue to grow our global sourcing efforts. And as we move through 2015 and into next year, we continue to put satellite offices in more countries around the globe to make sure that we have boots on the street and really finding the next best factories that can deliver that promise to the consumer. So we're full speed ahead on global sourcing.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matt Nemer (Analysts)】\nFirst, I'm wondering if you can give us any read, early read, on the repackaging of your private brands. I think the goal was to have most of those in store by mid-year. And I'm wondering if you're getting any sales lift from that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Todd Vasos (Executives)】\nYes, Matt, as we look at the private brand repackaging and just the effort, in general, it's way early to give a real solid read on it. But I can tell you that half of the goods that we repackaged by about mid-year, and then the remainder 90% will be done probably by the end of the second and into the early third quarter. But the early read has been fairly positive. When we look at it, we are looking at it by item, by category. And there are a few changes that we've made already based on that. But overall, the consumer response has been very positive. And again, we did a lot, which we always do, a lot of consumer work before we launched each and every one of those items. So we had a real good idea of what it would do and it's coming very, very close to what we thought. But just like anything, there's always a little bit of back-and-forth that we need to do and a few items that we're changing as we speak.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matt Nemer (Analysts)】\nGot it, okay. And then on a separate topic, the digital coupon platform, can you give us a sense for how many of your customers have signed up for that or maybe the percent of baskets that are using a digital coupon? Just so we can kind of gauge the size of that -- that effort right now?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Todd Vasos (Executives)】\nWe really, Matt, haven't quantified that. But I could tell you that we've got goals and metrics in place to hit and we are on actually exceeding those sign-ups already through Q1 and now as we go into Q2. And as you heard, we're launching different programs in each quarter to encourage sign-up and to get people really involved in it. So stay tuned, more to come on that, because it's in its infancy stage, but we think it's a real differentiator for our channel.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matt Nemer (Analysts)】\nOkay. That's fair. And then just lastly, on the sky shelf initiative, is that more about the flow of inventory through the store, or adding safety stock to the store? And if it's the latter, how does that impact inventory dollars per store over time?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Todd Vasos (Executives)】\nYes, Matt, it really is the first. And that is, it facilitates getting product out of that back room and getting it right in front of the customer. Our store teams do a fabulous job day in and day out taking care of our customers. We want to make it easier for them. And the easiest way to stock the goods on the shelf would not be to go back in the back room and have to find it, but to be able to look right above the items and be able to stock it very effectively and efficiently that way. And that was really the impetus behind us doing that, was to make it easier on the stores. Now the byproduct of that is better in-stocks, because once again, if you see an aisle and you happen to be passing by the aisles, you may not have time in the way we did it in the past, to run in the back room to get the item, but you know what, you definitely have time to stop for a few seconds, look up and if it's there, pull a few down and put it on the shelf. So I think it's going to kill 2 birds with one stone and make things a lot easier for the stores, but also be able to enhance our in-stock position.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nIf anything, from a working capital point of view, it should reduce working capital, because it will be out there, you'll get it on the shelf quicker, it will sell quicker, and it should, in no way, will it add inventory. It's just being more efficient with the inventory and actually, hopefully, making it turn even quicker.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matt Nemer (Analysts)】\nMakes a lot of sense. Todd, congrats on your new role.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Todd Vasos (Executives)】\nThank you, Matt.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Heinbockel (Analysts)】\nI wanted to follow up on corporate brand topic. So how satisfied do you think you are with corporate brand pricing, particularly versus the hard discounters? And then with Smart & Simple, how much do you think -- will there be a Smart & Simple alternative in every category and subcategory? And if so, where do you get the shelf space for that, is that national brand or more facings?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Todd Vasos (Executives)】\nJohn, a couple of good questions. Number one, we look at pricing, whether it's national brand or private brand, across the entire spectrum of where we do business, every 2 weeks. So we're very, very attuned to pricing. And we feel pretty confident on both our national brand, but especially our private brand pricing, as it relates to mass grocery and drug. Now in saying that, well, we continue to watch pricing as national brands get -- may get more aggressive. We also then make sure that we watch our spreads between national brand and private brands. And at those times, we'll reduce our prices if need be to keep those spreads. But as you look at our private brands and the way that we're looking at them, Smart & Simple does play a key role in that affordability piece. And I wouldn't say that we're going to have it in every single category. But I can tell you that right now, the 45 or 50 items that we launched this year or late last year and into this year, has been very, very good for us. The consumer has -- has resonated with the consumer. They like the value and the affordability that Smart & Simple offers, with a pretty good promise on the quality of the item. So stay tuned, John. I think you're going to see an acceleration of Smart & Simple as we go forward, because we know that it's a true differentiator for us, but also it really helps the consumer.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Heinbockel (Analysts)】\nAnd then lastly, as a follow-up, if you think about -- I mean, your share is still very small in any of your categories. Where is the best opportunity to drive, think beyond 2015, investing in more labor investing and price, is there enough elasticity if you invest in price to drive some of that share? How do you look at the 2 versus each other?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Todd Vasos (Executives)】\nWell, we look at both all the time. And we look at the marketplace all the time. And I think you know us pretty well. If we feel that we need to invest in labor, we do. If we feel like we need to invest in price, we do. The real key, and we've said it many, many times, is driving units. If we drive units through the store and those transactions, then comps sales come. So we're confident in that model and the nice thing is we have the flexibility, and we've proven that over time, to be able to take whatever action we need to take to make sure that we continue to drive market share. And by the way, our market share continues to grow, as you heard, and we don't see that stopping, because we've got a real good strong category management plan out there that will leverage up on a lot of different areas to be able to drive that market share.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Stephen Grambling (Analysts)】\nThis is actually just a follow-up on an earlier comment on the non-consumables. Can you just provide a little more detail on what has changed in apparel, specifically to drive the better results and maybe what are some of the ongoing initiatives that will continue to be benefiting this part of the mix?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Todd Vasos (Executives)】\nYes, that's a great question. A few things, and we've been working on apparel for many years, but Cindy Long and her team have done a phenomenal job in getting this very, very relevant in apparel. And when we look at apparel, it's both basics and then fashion basics. We're not out there on the cutting-edge of fashion, but fashion basics is really where Cindy and her team have brought us. And the consumer is really resonating. And then as we took her learnings from that, and then put in the affordability pieces that we've now ingrained within our category management process to include apparel, the consumers have really, really responded to that. So we are -- we're pretty bullish on apparel. I don't think any of us would have probably said that a few years ago. But I can tell you that the team has done some real nice work there and we see that only enhancing as we continue to move through the rest of this year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Stephen Grambling (Analysts)】\nGreat, that's helpful. And then maybe changing gears. I realize oftentimes you don't comment on these specifically, but can you just talk to your thought process more generally about evaluating acquisitions?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Todd Vasos (Executives)】\nWe've always said, and David can also chime in here. We'll look at anything that may be out there. But the great thing about our model is that, and you've heard me a little earlier, we've got 13,000 or so opportunities in the continental United States alone. So we're very, very focused on that organic growth right now. But never say never. And we're always going to look at everything. But we feel very confident in our real estate model and where we're headed right now.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Stephen Grambling (Analysts)】\nThanks, best of luck in the new role.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Todd Vasos (Executives)】\nThank you.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Mushkin (Analysts)】\nAnd so I guess my question is more as we look out. I mean, obviously, this year is going kind of on plan and maybe even a little bit better. But as we move out to next year and we talk about the labor investments, got another competitor of yours now upping the starting salaries to $10, so it's going to put some probably further pressure on that labor line. Plus the 900 stores, it just seems as I kind of look at '17, it looks a little harder from my perspective. And I wanted you to talk me out of that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Todd Vasos (Executives)】\nYes, I think it's fair to say that we've got a very, very strong plan that we're executing against for this year. We've already laid plans for 2016. Stay tuned. I think you're going to be pretty happy as we continue to move through this. We've proven that we can continue to move comp sales. We've proven that we can continue to balance the P&L pretty strong and still return a lot to the shareholders. And I think that you're going to continue to see that from us. But -- and as it relates to the wages, we're continuing to monitor that. We monitor everything out there in retail and wages are no different. But keep in mind, we still have a lot of flexibility. And the real hallmark of a great retailer is the ability to drive productivity at store level and we'll continue to do that. And if we can continue to do that, it will afford us that flexibility to do whatever we need to do to be competitive.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Mushkin (Analysts)】\nAnd then just one follow-up. I noticed -- I think your rent growth is close to 15% last year. As we accelerate the stores, and obviously, we're at the kind of tail end of the -- it looks like economic cycle, at least more at the end, how is rent growth? How should we think about rent growth going forward? Is it harder to get space as you're paying more? Or no?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Tehle (Executives)】\nYes, I think, and again, we don't give specific guidance on individual line items, but we have an extremely sophisticated, effective real estate process, as Todd mentioned earlier, and we're very pleased with what we see out of that. We believe we're getting the lowest rent possible for somebody in our space. We're happy with what we're driving there. And again, it's all about productivity in the box. As we look at the individual boxes, if we're dealing with a little higher rent, then we've got to figure out how to make that box more productive to pay for that rent. And again, I think we've got a lot of programs to do that, also. So it's just part of the evolution of our model as we move forward. And I think we've got a lot of strategies to help offset those higher rents.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mary Winn Pilkington (Executives)】\nThank you. I know we're leaving some people in the queue, so I apologize about that, but Matt Hancock and I will be around to take any calls. So please feel free to give me a call, and thank you for joining us today.",

And a very good morning, everybody.\r\nSo this morning, I will just go through the results for the year quickly in summary and then hand over to Den to go through some of the financial information, and then I'll go through the business performance and outlook in more detail.\r\nBut first of all, the sort of key messages for the year. Good progress, I think, in 2014, '15, led particularly by ECT, but as a group as a whole, in line with expectations, in line with what we expected to do at the start of the year. Underlying earnings per share are up 6%, and the dividend, as you can see, up 9%.\r\nAs we described in the Investor Day, we're focusing on our core markets, ones where we can use our chemistry skills and its application. And during the year, we've sold our Gold and Silver Refining business. We've talked about that before, but today, we announced that we're in advanced negotiations on the disposal of our Research Chemicals business. All good businesses, both of them good businesses but no longer a fit for Johnson Matthey going forward.\r\nWe are, though, investing in new areas that fit with our business model. And you've seen we've done 2 acquisitions in battery materials but also 1 in -- it's called StePac we bought just a week or 2 ago in our Atmosphere Control Technologies. So I'm pleased with the progress we're making on the managing of our portfolio.\r\nGoing forward into the year we're now in, we expect good underlying growth from our continuing businesses. And I'm pleased to say the long-term drivers that we described and went through in January, in our Investor Day, remain strong.\r\nNow before I hand over to Den, I just want to talk a little bit about our health and safety performance. And it's an area we've then enhanced and increased our focus over the last few months. And it's an area -- one of the things we try and do is start each meeting with a safety moment, so I thought I'd do that with you all today.\r\nAnd one of the things that we have been talking about is the use of mobile phones, particularly in a car. Those who are driving alone: They've done some studies in the U.S., and about 25%, I've heard, of accidents in the U.S. are caused by being on your mobile phone. And of course, here in Europe and particularly in the U.K., we think, ah, well, we're all right because we go hands free, but there's been recent study saying that about 90% of the distraction caused by being on the phone is not because you're hands free. It's because you're talking to somebody else. So I'd strongly encourage you, as you're driving along maybe home at the weekend or tonight and somebody phones you, just pull over. Or just let it go and don't answer it because it's -- you are far more likely to have an accident if you are on -- concentrating on something else.\r\nBut we are spending a lot of effort on enhancing our health and safety performance. You can see that we've managed, over the last few months, to reduce our lost time incident rate by 25%. And -- but about 50% of our accidents are caused by sort of slips, trips and falls, and so there's a lot of work going on across the group on behavioral safety to try and minimize those. And we've set ourselves a target to get to -- this lost time incident rate down to 0.2. And if we do that, we'll be best in class. And I'm very pleased with the performance of the team and the group around how they're embracing this drive to try and improve and enhance our performance.\r\nAnd with that, I'll hand over to Den to talk through our financial review.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Robert. And good morning, everyone.\r\nI'm now going to take you through our full year financial results, and we'll start with the underlying numbers.\r\nAs Robert has said, the group has made good progress. In the second half, we built on the solid first-6-months' results. As the table shows, sales were up 5%, and profit before tax was up 3%. However, these numbers are weighed down by FX and the loss of commission income from Anglo. Excluding these, sales grew 9% and profit before tax was 15% ahead, demonstrating that the business is in good shape and performing well.\r\nInterest was slightly lower than last year, as we've guided to previously. You may remember that, in June 2003, we refinanced some of the debt early, taken advantage of low interest rate environment and increased our interest rate charge for that year.\r\nTowards the bottom of the table, you can see EPS is up 6%, helped by the lower U.K. headline tax rate. This went down from 23% to 21% during the year and has now reduced further to 20% for the year we are currently in.\r\nOur guidance on tax remains the same in that we expect our effective tax rate to be maintained at a least 3% lower than the U.K. headline rate of tax.\r\nNow I just want to touch on the dividend here. The board is recommending a final dividend of 49.5p, which brings the total dividend per share for the year to 68p, a 9% increase. This is in line with the half year and 3% above the growth in earnings per share, a reflection of the board's confidence in the group's long-term performance.\r\nNow if we delve a little bit more into what has driven the group's underlying PBT. In line with what we said at the half year, FX did not impact us in the second half, but there was a GBP 16 million impact in the first half, which reduced PBT by 4% for the year as a whole. Anglo also reduced PBT by around GBP 30 million, representing a 7% drag. From this rebased starting point, you can see the growth contribution from each of the main divisions: ECT, as a large division with a strong performance in the year, helped grow the group's PBT by 10%. Process Technologies, Precious Metal Products and Fine Chemicals also grew, while New Businesses' loss increased slightly.\r\nSo you can see the good overall growth in the underlying businesses, and Robert will give you more details of their performance a little bit later.\r\nNow I just wanted to give you a quick reconciliation here on our reported results. You can see the big movement is a profit of just under GBP 70 million on the sale of Gold and Silver Refining. As you know, this business was sold for GBP 124 million in the year. So reported profit before tax of GBP 495.8 million is up 22%. Earnings per share of 211.2% (sic) [211.2p] is up 26%.\r\nTurning now to cash flow.\r\nCash flow from operations was GBP 126 million compared to GBP 477 million last year. This is driven by movements in working capital, both precious metal and non-precious metal related. Obviously, working capital is at a point in time. And at the year-end, non-precious metal working capital had increased by GBP 253 million. Working capital days, again excluding precious metals, rose to 66 days from 59 at the half year and 45 last year.\r\nThe increase in working capital was driven by 4 main factors. In PT, high sales volumes in the final quarter, especially in February and March, converted to increased receivables in the year-end. ECT's Asian business has continued to grow, and customers here have relatively longer payment terms compared to other regions. Inventories in both ECT and PT increased ahead of sales expected in the first quarter of 2015, '16. As you remember, PT had a very weak first quarter in 2014, '15. And finally, lower licensing activity in PT, which is typically cash positive. So 4 key reasons, 3 relating to timing of increased business activity.\r\nNow on precious metal working capital. This also increased by GBP 180 million, mainly within pgm balances in our Precious Metal Products division. As you know, these balances do vary, depending upon any particular point in time. We are confident that these high levels at year-end are not indicative of ongoing metal balances.\r\nNow a quick slide on cash flow conversion. Here you can see the detail behind the calculation. And excluding precious metal working capital, cash flow is GBP 210 million, resulting in a cash flow conversion of 44%. So what does this mean going forward? As I've mentioned already, working capital is at a point in time, and I do expect it to be reduced from the year-end levels. Indeed, in April, we have seen a GBP 100 million improvement already.\r\nAs was mentioned last year, 45 days was unusually low. And with a growing business as well as expansion in China, I expect working capital days to be, on average, in the range of 50 to 60 days by the year-end and going forward. This is in line with historic levels, as you can see from the chart on the top right. As we've seen over the last few years, it can be slightly out of this range. Last year, it was 5 years -- 5 days below this, and now it is 6 days above it. But we are driving the business to deliver working capital within this level.\r\nThe low cash flow conversion this year, which is a factor of the working capital movements, is expected to reverse. And based on our forecast, this is expected to average around 70% over the next few years.\r\nI'll cover the capital expenditure in a moment, but there's a continued investment to support the business growth that will hold back future cash conversion to some extent.\r\nNow moving on to investment and, in particular, capital expenditure. This was just over GBP 210 million for the year, with spend in ECT and PT making up over half of this, with the key projects being those we highlighted to you at the half year.\r\nIn ECT, in the second half, we continued to extend manufacturing capacity in the U.K. to meet future demand from the new European legislation. That's Euro 6b and 6c. And this project will be ongoing for the next few years. In PT, we completed capacity expansions of our chemical catalyst manufacturing sites in Germany. And the construction of a VCM catalyst plant in China is also largely complete. So CapEx-to-depreciation was around 1.6x. And I think it will stay between this level and 1.8x for the next year or so, with depreciation increasing and CapEx rising next year to around GBP 280 million. This figure includes a shift of some CapEx spend that moved out of 2014, '15 into our current year. As we mentioned at the Investor Day in January, we are also investing in our core business systems, expecting to spend around GBP 100 million over the next 5 years. And this is also included in this forecast.\r\nSo overall, CapEx is expected to remain high to support future business growth.\r\nTurning to research and development. We continued to invest around 5% of sales in research and development this year, with around 83% of this spent on development work within our divisions.\r\nSo let's now move on to look at return on invested capital. This was 18.8%, down 2% from last year and slightly below our 20% target for the group. This was driven predominantly by the loss of income from the Anglo contract, which was about a 1.5% headwind. And to be clear, we have strict investment criteria, and return on invested capital continues to be a key metric. We are committed to our 20% target and look to continue to invest to drive long-term value for the group.\r\nFinally, a brief look at some of the other areas of the balance sheet.\r\nOur net debt has increased from GBP 729 million last year to GBP 994 million. This is due to the movements in working capital that I've already discussed. The balance sheet remains strong with net debt-to-EBITDA of 1.7x, which is within our target range of 1.5x to 2x. Average cost of debt is 2.4%, with an average tenure of 5.7 years.\r\nFinally, on pensions. As previously advised, we have undertaken a number of actions to reduce our pension deficit. We are currently undertaking our triennial valuation of our main scheme. We'd advise you of the results of the -- at the half year announcement in November this year.\r\nOn an accounting basis, unfortunately, the discount rates are against us for the coming year. Now these are based on AA-rated corporate bond yields. And as at the year-end of March 2015, they were significantly lower than the previous year. This means an increase in net pension liabilities of GBP 31 million to GBP 194 million. Now this has a knock-on impact on pension service costs for 2015, '16, where we expect costs to grow by GBP 15 million. This increase is predominantly noncash and driven by the change in discount rates I've just mentioned. This cost will be charged in underlying operating profit, and we have included this in the guidance we have given to you on the outlook for the 5 divisions for 2015, '16.\r\nSo that's all for me, and I'll now hand you back to Robert. He will take you through the performance of each of the divisions. Thank you.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Den.\r\nAnd I'll just start off. And before I go through the operating view, just a little bit about this picture. It's a picture of 2 of our colleagues in Germiston in South Africa, which is one of ECT, John's ECT, plants there, where we've been doing a lot of effort and a lot of work on operational improvements, particularly on energy efficiency. And over the last couple of years, they've reduced energy by 25%, which just saved about GBP 0.75 million. And that's just one example of all the things that John and his team are doing to drive the improvements in the margins that I'll talk about in a second.\r\nSo ECT, as you know, had another strong year. We're very pleased with its performance, with at constant rates, sales up by 12% and underlying profit by 21%. And you can see the improvement in margins here, 12.4% going to 13.3%, and that is due to a whole series of things, not one thing at all: development of new materials, lower-cost materials, to go into our manufacturing process; freeing up capacity through lost -- less-complex routes of manufacturing. So some instances we used 2 -- we'll be using multilayer passes [ph] to make a catalyst. And now we're able to, in some cases, do single layer, and that just frees up additional capacity at no extra cost.\r\nMargins are now at very good levels. And I think they're sustainable at this level, but I don't think there's any more to come. I think they'll be here or hereabouts. We've got further operational improvements we need to go after, but at the same time, our customers continue to challenge us on price and returns.\r\nLooking at light duty. A good performance from our light duty business, where our sales are up 9% at constant currency compared to a growth in global car production of 1%. In the U.S., volumes are in-line, but the mix effect has been slightly negative, hence a reduction in our sales. In Europe, we've benefited from Euro 6b legislation, which came into force, as you know, and for new models in September last year; and for all models, will come into force in September this year. This gives us basically a NOx emission standard such that the NOx from the diesel is about the same as NOx from gasoline cars. And it's around about half of new models now are fitted with the Euro 6b system, so we've got further growth in the second half of this year as we get towards full implementation.\r\nThere've been lots of talk about the death of diesel, as you know. John discussed that at the Investor Day last -- in January. And in the first in our year, about 52% of cars sold in Western Europe were diesel, which is exactly the same as it was last year. So we haven't seen any impact yet of any, although there's talk in the press, but of course, we still expect, and we've talked about it before, a gradual decline in the diesel penetration in Europe. But diesel is an important factor in the whole requirement by car companies to increase their CO2 efficiency, so we still think it's an important part of the overall mix.\r\nOur performance in Asia has also been good, supported by strong growth in China where we have very good relationships with many OEMs.\r\nOn the heavy duty side, a very good year across all regions. Sale is up here by 18%. And we've got growth in all the markets here, all the regions here, but for very different reasons. In the U.S., it's because of the Class 8 trucks. Those are the big transcontinental trucks which have more catalyst value per vehicle. And we've had that replacement cycle that was -- that we had all trucks in the last -- through the recession. That replacement cycle is now happening. And I think, throughout this year, we'll continue to see that high level of new production, but I think we're reaching peak levels.\r\nIn Europe, the first half obviously benefited from Euro 6, and we've now got full fitments of Euro 6 on diesel trucks. And the sales were good and grew quite a lot this year despite the fact that the market was actually very weak. In Asia, we've now got about 35% of fitment of Euro IV trucks, but of course, remember, these are relatively simple non-pgm catalysts that fit on a truck in China.\r\nSo looking ahead for ECT. Air quality remains a global issue. In light duty, I think we've still got further structural growth ahead of us with this Euro 6b I already talked about, but in the medium term, Euro 6c will require filters on some direct-injection gasoline cars, and that will double the value per gasoline car in Europe. And we're also seeing some early signs, encouraging signs of increased diesel penetration in the U.S., which is slightly going against the trend in -- here in Europe.\r\nOn the heavy duty side, there's no new legislation in the U.S. and Europe, so now what's likely to happen going forward is more likely to track the market for underlying truck production in the future. In the U.S., I've already mentioned that we expect the Class 8 trucks to be relatively stable for the rest of this year. And in the EU, perhaps we've got -- we'll have -- in a few years' time, when the EU starts recovering perhaps, then maybe we'll have an old fleet and we'll see the replacement cycle come through, but we're certainly not expecting that in '15, '16. So therefore, the real growth is in China as we continue the rollout of Euro IV. And as we talk about on the slide here, Beijing VI is talked about for 2018. And Beijing VI is effectively the same as Euro VI, so we'll require filters to be fitted on a truck in China. Non-road in Europe will also require fitment of filters, and so that growth could come in '19, '20.\r\nSo overall, the structural drivers remain in the medium term, and we expect a continued strong performance from ECT in this year.\r\nTurning now to Process Technologies. They made progress in the year, with growth in sales and profit of 7%, so a good performance overall given the change in mix, especially because of the lower contribution from licensing.\r\nSo we turn to Chemicals. First of all, good growth in catalysts but slower in the licensing side. Sales were up, as you can see, as a division -- as a sector by 4% at constant currency with higher sales of ammonia and formaldehyde technologies but lower demand in methanol. And that's the normal cycle. It seems to work on a sort of a 2-year cycle. So last year, we had low sales of ammonia and higher sales of methanol. This year, it's the other way around. And in the year we're now in, it's probably going to revert back to high demand for methanol and slightly lower for ammonia, so a sort of 2-year cycle and slightly out of -- they seem to be out of phase at the moment.\r\nAnd on the licensing side, that was also down. Although we won 6 new licenses, they'll be relatively low value and not unexpected but principally due to the slowdown in China, where there's now sufficient capacity for many of the petrochemical plants that we have our licensing technology. So we're well working on a whole series of new technologies such as VCM, but they take time to come into market. And really, the first challenge is getting that first reference site, having one customer to have the confidence to build up the first plant. Once you get one plant, then you're more likely to get others following, but the first reference site does take quite some time. And we're also working on a number of bio-based feedstocks for licensing technologies too.\r\nSo for licensing, I think it will be lower again in '15, '16, the year we're now in, but then in '16, '17 and beyond, we'll then start to see a recovery and return to growth.\r\nOn the Oil and Gas side, they performed well across all sectors, with sales up by 11%. Now remember here, about 75% of our Oil and Gas business is to mid and downstream sector, mostly catalysts and additives and not services, so relatively less impacted by the lower oil price. So over the last year, we've seen good demand supported by tighter fuel specifications and lower emissions for refineries requiring our products.\r\nHydrogen has done well this year, supported by new plant builds, particularly in the Middle East, which has helped. And on the additives side, high-performance materials rather than emission materials have allowed us to grow that business as well.\r\nOn the Diagnostic Services side, that's our Tracerco business, they had a good year, but this is the business that has the upstream exposure. A lot of the work they do is on acid integrity and acid performance improvements. New products are going well and showing good customer demand, but the oil price fall has seen a reduction in activity, and that will probably impact this business in this year.\r\nSo looking ahead, as we said in January, we see a short-term hiatus. It's going to be tough for this business to grow this year, but the long-term drivers remain good.\r\nSo this year, it's really around good demand for catalysts I think we'll still see in PT. And the oil and gases' business should continue to perform well, but the licensing side, as I've already said, will offset that growth on the catalyst side. And we've got 3 reasons here principally why the licensing income is dropping, and it's really partly to do with the coal-to-SNG projects in China. Those are being slowed down. But also, the petrochemical capacity is pretty much in line with the market demand today.\r\nThe long-term drivers, though, remain in place for this division, so although we expect this year to be broadly in line with last year, I think that outlook for the longer term is good. And to be honest on the outlook for this year, this is the area of risk in this whole -- when we look at outlooks. There's probably more risk on the downside in this sector -- in this division, I should say, than perhaps any others when we're looking in the outlook for this year.\r\nOn Precious Metal Products division, it's been impacted, as we know, by the Anglo contract, which has now completely gone through our numbers. And this probably is the last time you'll hear us talking about Anglo, in relation to our results at least. So at constant rates, down 9% at sales level and 21% at the operating profit level. Of course, that was also -- the sales were also lower because of weakness in our Gold and Silver Refining business, which had a relatively poor sales performance in this year, but of course we've now sold that and we won't have that going forward.\r\nSo a difficult year for the business but still a high-margin business. And the return on capital, you can see it's dropped quite a long way, but I think that should recover and should, in the medium term, be around 30%. That's the sort of the level of return on capital that we should be achieving from this division, still a high-margin, \"high return on capital\" division.\r\nOn the Services side, I've already mentioned the Anglo contract, but it's been a mixed year for Refining and recycling. Volumes are slightly higher overall, helped by the Stillwater contract, which has boosted our palladium intakes. But we have seen on an intake basis some falloff in the fourth quarter, so the first calendar quarter of this year, and those sale -- that intake volume responding to lower prices will then start impacting our results in this first quarter of this financial year.\r\nAnd also, our mix has been less favorable. There's been a lot more filters coming through our spent autocatalyst feedstock inputs -- intakes, I would say. And filters, if you think they started being fitted to cars about 8 to 10 years ago, so now they started to be scrapped, and they take quite a lot more time to process through our refinery. And that's one of the reasons why we've had increase in our pgm balances, because we're still working on that mix and how we improve the performance of the refineries and make sure that we deal with these issues going forward.\r\nSo we're working on efficiencies. And we'll continue to invest in those and continue work on improving in '15, '16, but remember, of course, the pgm prices do impact our business. And we've said before that a 10% movement in the pgm price for a full year is about a GBP 5 million impact to sales and profit.\r\nOn the manufacturing side, steady overall but lots of moving parts here. Relatively mature, as you know, as we talked about in January, high margin, relatively higher return on capital but relatively growth-limited in some of these businesses. Previously, we've focused on that, return on capital and margin, and now we're looking for some growth. So more investment coming in, but that will take some time before that yields benefits.\r\nBut looking at the businesses in the year. Noble Metals has some good demand for its pgm gauzes but is offset by other industrial product weaknesses. And our Advanced Glass Technologies business track the global car production for automated glass, and we're increasing our presence in Asia, where of course that's where the growth in the car market is.\r\nSo looking ahead for PMP. It will be a tough year in this year, but also we're investing for growth.\r\nOn the Refining side, the shift in mix that I mentioned about will continue to impact us this year, but we are looking for efficiency improvements. And we are also investing in a refinery in China. That's a 10 to -- about GBP 15 million investment, initially to support industrial products. But going forward, it will be available, obviously, to us when cars start being scrapped in China, but that's not for a few years yet.\r\nOn the manufacturing side, relatively stable. We're investing. And I think there might be a little bit of growth this year in that business, but going forward, the growth should come in the years -- in the future.\r\nSo of course, the outlook for this division will be significantly down, primarily because, of course, we no longer have the gold and silver business but also because of the impacts of the things that I've talked about on the refinery side.\r\nFine Chemicals had a good year, sales up by 3% and profit by 7%; a good effort by the API team, manufacturing team, particularly on process efficiencies and on the raw material improvements in price, et cetera.\r\nThe sale of the Research Chemicals business, as I said, we've -- we're in advanced negotiations there. We hope to be in a position to close that this year, calendar year. And we'll announce in the near future when we're ready to do that. It's a good business, but it doesn't fit with our business model going forward.\r\nWhat we're doing now, though, across the group business is leverage our synergies between our API Manufacturing businesses; and our catalysts (sic) [Catalysis] and Chiral Technologies businesses, CCT. And that leverage on synergies have started to have an effect. In the year, demand for our APIs across our portfolio was mixed, but steady growth overall. And we continue to develop new products and new opportunities.\r\nOn the Research Chemicals side, just to finish and help you. The sales, as you can see, were GBP 77 million in the year. The margin of this business is around about 20%. So you can work out what the impact will be for your numbers for the year, obviously depending upon when we finally complete.\r\nLooking ahead, the robust longer-term growth potential for the division is still there. We expect good growth in our API Manufacturing businesses this year and beyond. We continue to invest in the developments of more and more complex APIs. Not all of them are in controlled substances, so we're -- more and more diversification of the APIs that we're going after. \r\nAnd just last year, we bought a new facility in Scotland, in the -- just north of Carlisle. And that's a bit like the facility we bought in the U.S. If you remember, a couple of years ago, we bought a facility off Lonza in Conshohocken in Pennsylvania. And this is a large plant, has been a former GSK one, that we believe that we can use. We'll spend a little bit of money, a little bit of CapEx getting it up and running. And then in mid-2016, it will be well -- give us an opportunity to provide growth for our business here in Europe.\r\nSo the strong drivers remain. We continue to work on the formulation and development of new generics. These take 3 or 4 years once the ANDA has been filed and approved by the development agency, then 3 or 4 years before you actually start seeing real revenues, so we've got to have a number of these to make sure that we can grow and provide that portfolio of products and not rely on just 1 or 2.\r\nSo we expect this year to make good progress in this division, of course excluding the impact of the sale of Research Chemicals.\r\nFinally, New Businesses. Made good progress in the year, principally as a result of the acquisitions they've done both in Battery Technologies but also subsequently in the Atmosphere Control Technologies acquisition we did recently.\r\nBattery Technologies, the acquisitions, we're working on integrating those into the business. And we like what we see, so far, and it provides us good opportunities to develop this business in the longer term. And with Battery Technologies, there's only a modest loss in the year, and the 2 materials acquisitions were slightly profitable.\r\nOn Fuel Cells, there's more and more activity going on, as you know, across the world. And we're working very closely with a number of the OEMs. We aren't on any of their platforms yet, but we're working very hard. And we're working with many of them and hope to be, in the next 2 or 3 years, on some of those platforms as they continue to get into larger-scale production.\r\nSo overall, good progress and a higher loss, though, as you can see, as we continue to invest in the business. And obviously, some of the integration costs are in here too.\r\nLooking ahead, we continue to want to deepen the portfolio, and this is all about providing the next engines of growth for the group. Battery Technologies, this year, we expect to be breakeven if we exclude the integration costs. Atmospheric control, the acquisition, StePac that we bought just last month, expect sales, as it says, of about GBP 20 million with a small operating profit. So overall, we continue to invest in areas where we can use our chemistry skills and our application expertise to provide those next engines of growth. And we still think, for '15, '16, we'll see a modest reduction in the loss this year, but then hopefully, we're still well placed for breakeven in '17, '18, again as we said in January, at the Investor Day.\r\nSo just putting it all together. I've gone through each of the individual division's outlooks, so if we look at the group as a whole: We expect the underlying growth to -- in the continuing businesses to be good and to continue to be strong, but because of the disposals, the net-net, you end up with the '15, '16 numbers being just slightly ahead of '14, '15, but we're very well placed for the long-term growth in the business.\r\nSo to finish up and just to recap before questions.\r\nI think we've had good progress in the year led particularly by ECT but with EPS up 6%. We're focusing on attractive markets, and we'll continue to keep that chemistry and applications focus going forward as we manage the portfolio. And as I've just said, we expect '15, '16 to be slightly ahead of '14, '15, but the long-term drivers remain strong and in place.\r\nAnd with that, I'll -- just give us a few minutes or a few seconds to set up, and we'll take your questions.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Sally Jones (Executives)】\nGood morning, everybody. Before we start, could I please just ask you to turn your mobile phones off? Thank you.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Robert MacLeod (Executives)】\nThanks, Sally. And a very good morning, everybody.\r\nSo this morning, I will just go through the results for the year quickly in summary and then hand over to Den to go through some of the financial information, and then I'll go through the business performance and outlook in more detail.\r\nBut first of all, the sort of key messages for the year. Good progress, I think, in 2014, '15, led particularly by ECT, but as a group as a whole, in line with expectations, in line with what we expected to do at the start of the year. Underlying earnings per share are up 6%, and the dividend, as you can see, up 9%.\r\nAs we described in the Investor Day, we're focusing on our core markets, ones where we can use our chemistry skills and its application. And during the year, we've sold our Gold and Silver Refining business. We've talked about that before, but today, we announced that we're in advanced negotiations on the disposal of our Research Chemicals business. All good businesses, both of them good businesses but no longer a fit for Johnson Matthey going forward.\r\nWe are, though, investing in new areas that fit with our business model. And you've seen we've done 2 acquisitions in battery materials but also 1 in -- it's called StePac we bought just a week or 2 ago in our Atmosphere Control Technologies. So I'm pleased with the progress we're making on the managing of our portfolio.\r\nGoing forward into the year we're now in, we expect good underlying growth from our continuing businesses. And I'm pleased to say the long-term drivers that we described and went through in January, in our Investor Day, remain strong.\r\nNow before I hand over to Den, I just want to talk a little bit about our health and safety performance. And it's an area we've then enhanced and increased our focus over the last few months. And it's an area -- one of the things we try and do is start each meeting with a safety moment, so I thought I'd do that with you all today.\r\nAnd one of the things that we have been talking about is the use of mobile phones, particularly in a car. Those who are driving alone: They've done some studies in the U.S., and about 25%, I've heard, of accidents in the U.S. are caused by being on your mobile phone. And of course, here in Europe and particularly in the U.K., we think, ah, well, we're all right because we go hands free, but there's been recent study saying that about 90% of the distraction caused by being on the phone is not because you're hands free. It's because you're talking to somebody else. So I'd strongly encourage you, as you're driving along maybe home at the weekend or tonight and somebody phones you, just pull over. Or just let it go and don't answer it because it's -- you are far more likely to have an accident if you are on -- concentrating on something else.\r\nBut we are spending a lot of effort on enhancing our health and safety performance. You can see that we've managed, over the last few months, to reduce our lost time incident rate by 25%. And -- but about 50% of our accidents are caused by sort of slips, trips and falls, and so there's a lot of work going on across the group on behavioral safety to try and minimize those. And we've set ourselves a target to get to -- this lost time incident rate down to 0.2. And if we do that, we'll be best in class. And I'm very pleased with the performance of the team and the group around how they're embracing this drive to try and improve and enhance our performance.\r\nAnd with that, I'll hand over to Den to talk through our financial review.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Den Jones (Executives)】\nThank you, Robert. And good morning, everyone.\r\nI'm now going to take you through our full year financial results, and we'll start with the underlying numbers.\r\nAs Robert has said, the group has made good progress. In the second half, we built on the solid first-6-months' results. As the table shows, sales were up 5%, and profit before tax was up 3%. However, these numbers are weighed down by FX and the loss of commission income from Anglo. Excluding these, sales grew 9% and profit before tax was 15% ahead, demonstrating that the business is in good shape and performing well.\r\nInterest was slightly lower than last year, as we've guided to previously. You may remember that, in June 2003, we refinanced some of the debt early, taken advantage of low interest rate environment and increased our interest rate charge for that year.\r\nTowards the bottom of the table, you can see EPS is up 6%, helped by the lower U.K. headline tax rate. This went down from 23% to 21% during the year and has now reduced further to 20% for the year we are currently in.\r\nOur guidance on tax remains the same in that we expect our effective tax rate to be maintained at a least 3% lower than the U.K. headline rate of tax.\r\nNow I just want to touch on the dividend here. The board is recommending a final dividend of 49.5p, which brings the total dividend per share for the year to 68p, a 9% increase. This is in line with the half year and 3% above the growth in earnings per share, a reflection of the board's confidence in the group's long-term performance.\r\nNow if we delve a little bit more into what has driven the group's underlying PBT. In line with what we said at the half year, FX did not impact us in the second half, but there was a GBP 16 million impact in the first half, which reduced PBT by 4% for the year as a whole. Anglo also reduced PBT by around GBP 30 million, representing a 7% drag. From this rebased starting point, you can see the growth contribution from each of the main divisions: ECT, as a large division with a strong performance in the year, helped grow the group's PBT by 10%. Process Technologies, Precious Metal Products and Fine Chemicals also grew, while New Businesses' loss increased slightly.\r\nSo you can see the good overall growth in the underlying businesses, and Robert will give you more details of their performance a little bit later.\r\nNow I just wanted to give you a quick reconciliation here on our reported results. You can see the big movement is a profit of just under GBP 70 million on the sale of Gold and Silver Refining. As you know, this business was sold for GBP 124 million in the year. So reported profit before tax of GBP 495.8 million is up 22%. Earnings per share of 211.2% (sic) [211.2p] is up 26%.\r\nTurning now to cash flow.\r\nCash flow from operations was GBP 126 million compared to GBP 477 million last year. This is driven by movements in working capital, both precious metal and non-precious metal related. Obviously, working capital is at a point in time. And at the year-end, non-precious metal working capital had increased by GBP 253 million. Working capital days, again excluding precious metals, rose to 66 days from 59 at the half year and 45 last year.\r\nThe increase in working capital was driven by 4 main factors. In PT, high sales volumes in the final quarter, especially in February and March, converted to increased receivables in the year-end. ECT's Asian business has continued to grow, and customers here have relatively longer payment terms compared to other regions. Inventories in both ECT and PT increased ahead of sales expected in the first quarter of 2015, '16. As you remember, PT had a very weak first quarter in 2014, '15. And finally, lower licensing activity in PT, which is typically cash positive. So 4 key reasons, 3 relating to timing of increased business activity.\r\nNow on precious metal working capital. This also increased by GBP 180 million, mainly within pgm balances in our Precious Metal Products division. As you know, these balances do vary, depending upon any particular point in time. We are confident that these high levels at year-end are not indicative of ongoing metal balances.\r\nNow a quick slide on cash flow conversion. Here you can see the detail behind the calculation. And excluding precious metal working capital, cash flow is GBP 210 million, resulting in a cash flow conversion of 44%. So what does this mean going forward? As I've mentioned already, working capital is at a point in time, and I do expect it to be reduced from the year-end levels. Indeed, in April, we have seen a GBP 100 million improvement already.\r\nAs was mentioned last year, 45 days was unusually low. And with a growing business as well as expansion in China, I expect working capital days to be, on average, in the range of 50 to 60 days by the year-end and going forward. This is in line with historic levels, as you can see from the chart on the top right. As we've seen over the last few years, it can be slightly out of this range. Last year, it was 5 years -- 5 days below this, and now it is 6 days above it. But we are driving the business to deliver working capital within this level.\r\nThe low cash flow conversion this year, which is a factor of the working capital movements, is expected to reverse. And based on our forecast, this is expected to average around 70% over the next few years.\r\nI'll cover the capital expenditure in a moment, but there's a continued investment to support the business growth that will hold back future cash conversion to some extent.\r\nNow moving on to investment and, in particular, capital expenditure. This was just over GBP 210 million for the year, with spend in ECT and PT making up over half of this, with the key projects being those we highlighted to you at the half year.\r\nIn ECT, in the second half, we continued to extend manufacturing capacity in the U.K. to meet future demand from the new European legislation. That's Euro 6b and 6c. And this project will be ongoing for the next few years. In PT, we completed capacity expansions of our chemical catalyst manufacturing sites in Germany. And the construction of a VCM catalyst plant in China is also largely complete. So CapEx-to-depreciation was around 1.6x. And I think it will stay between this level and 1.8x for the next year or so, with depreciation increasing and CapEx rising next year to around GBP 280 million. This figure includes a shift of some CapEx spend that moved out of 2014, '15 into our current year. As we mentioned at the Investor Day in January, we are also investing in our core business systems, expecting to spend around GBP 100 million over the next 5 years. And this is also included in this forecast.\r\nSo overall, CapEx is expected to remain high to support future business growth.\r\nTurning to research and development. We continued to invest around 5% of sales in research and development this year, with around 83% of this spent on development work within our divisions.\r\nSo let's now move on to look at return on invested capital. This was 18.8%, down 2% from last year and slightly below our 20% target for the group. This was driven predominantly by the loss of income from the Anglo contract, which was about a 1.5% headwind. And to be clear, we have strict investment criteria, and return on invested capital continues to be a key metric. We are committed to our 20% target and look to continue to invest to drive long-term value for the group.\r\nFinally, a brief look at some of the other areas of the balance sheet.\r\nOur net debt has increased from GBP 729 million last year to GBP 994 million. This is due to the movements in working capital that I've already discussed. The balance sheet remains strong with net debt-to-EBITDA of 1.7x, which is within our target range of 1.5x to 2x. Average cost of debt is 2.4%, with an average tenure of 5.7 years.\r\nFinally, on pensions. As previously advised, we have undertaken a number of actions to reduce our pension deficit. We are currently undertaking our triennial valuation of our main scheme. We'd advise you of the results of the -- at the half year announcement in November this year.\r\nOn an accounting basis, unfortunately, the discount rates are against us for the coming year. Now these are based on AA-rated corporate bond yields. And as at the year-end of March 2015, they were significantly lower than the previous year. This means an increase in net pension liabilities of GBP 31 million to GBP 194 million. Now this has a knock-on impact on pension service costs for 2015, '16, where we expect costs to grow by GBP 15 million. This increase is predominantly noncash and driven by the change in discount rates I've just mentioned. This cost will be charged in underlying operating profit, and we have included this in the guidance we have given to you on the outlook for the 5 divisions for 2015, '16.\r\nSo that's all for me, and I'll now hand you back to Robert. He will take you through the performance of each of the divisions. Thank you.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Robert MacLeod (Executives)】\nThank you, Den.\r\nAnd I'll just start off. And before I go through the operating view, just a little bit about this picture. It's a picture of 2 of our colleagues in Germiston in South Africa, which is one of ECT, John's ECT, plants there, where we've been doing a lot of effort and a lot of work on operational improvements, particularly on energy efficiency. And over the last couple of years, they've reduced energy by 25%, which just saved about GBP 0.75 million. And that's just one example of all the things that John and his team are doing to drive the improvements in the margins that I'll talk about in a second.\r\nSo ECT, as you know, had another strong year. We're very pleased with its performance, with at constant rates, sales up by 12% and underlying profit by 21%. And you can see the improvement in margins here, 12.4% going to 13.3%, and that is due to a whole series of things, not one thing at all: development of new materials, lower-cost materials, to go into our manufacturing process; freeing up capacity through lost -- less-complex routes of manufacturing. So some instances we used 2 -- we'll be using multilayer passes [ph] to make a catalyst. And now we're able to, in some cases, do single layer, and that just frees up additional capacity at no extra cost.\r\nMargins are now at very good levels. And I think they're sustainable at this level, but I don't think there's any more to come. I think they'll be here or hereabouts. We've got further operational improvements we need to go after, but at the same time, our customers continue to challenge us on price and returns.\r\nLooking at light duty. A good performance from our light duty business, where our sales are up 9% at constant currency compared to a growth in global car production of 1%. In the U.S., volumes are in-line, but the mix effect has been slightly negative, hence a reduction in our sales. In Europe, we've benefited from Euro 6b legislation, which came into force, as you know, and for new models in September last year; and for all models, will come into force in September this year. This gives us basically a NOx emission standard such that the NOx from the diesel is about the same as NOx from gasoline cars. And it's around about half of new models now are fitted with the Euro 6b system, so we've got further growth in the second half of this year as we get towards full implementation.\r\nThere've been lots of talk about the death of diesel, as you know. John discussed that at the Investor Day last -- in January. And in the first in our year, about 52% of cars sold in Western Europe were diesel, which is exactly the same as it was last year. So we haven't seen any impact yet of any, although there's talk in the press, but of course, we still expect, and we've talked about it before, a gradual decline in the diesel penetration in Europe. But diesel is an important factor in the whole requirement by car companies to increase their CO2 efficiency, so we still think it's an important part of the overall mix.\r\nOur performance in Asia has also been good, supported by strong growth in China where we have very good relationships with many OEMs.\r\nOn the heavy duty side, a very good year across all regions. Sale is up here by 18%. And we've got growth in all the markets here, all the regions here, but for very different reasons. In the U.S., it's because of the Class 8 trucks. Those are the big transcontinental trucks which have more catalyst value per vehicle. And we've had that replacement cycle that was -- that we had all trucks in the last -- through the recession. That replacement cycle is now happening. And I think, throughout this year, we'll continue to see that high level of new production, but I think we're reaching peak levels.\r\nIn Europe, the first half obviously benefited from Euro 6, and we've now got full fitments of Euro 6 on diesel trucks. And the sales were good and grew quite a lot this year despite the fact that the market was actually very weak. In Asia, we've now got about 35% of fitment of Euro IV trucks, but of course, remember, these are relatively simple non-pgm catalysts that fit on a truck in China.\r\nSo looking ahead for ECT. Air quality remains a global issue. In light duty, I think we've still got further structural growth ahead of us with this Euro 6b I already talked about, but in the medium term, Euro 6c will require filters on some direct-injection gasoline cars, and that will double the value per gasoline car in Europe. And we're also seeing some early signs, encouraging signs of increased diesel penetration in the U.S., which is slightly going against the trend in -- here in Europe.\r\nOn the heavy duty side, there's no new legislation in the U.S. and Europe, so now what's likely to happen going forward is more likely to track the market for underlying truck production in the future. In the U.S., I've already mentioned that we expect the Class 8 trucks to be relatively stable for the rest of this year. And in the EU, perhaps we've got -- we'll have -- in a few years' time, when the EU starts recovering perhaps, then maybe we'll have an old fleet and we'll see the replacement cycle come through, but we're certainly not expecting that in '15, '16. So therefore, the real growth is in China as we continue the rollout of Euro IV. And as we talk about on the slide here, Beijing VI is talked about for 2018. And Beijing VI is effectively the same as Euro VI, so we'll require filters to be fitted on a truck in China. Non-road in Europe will also require fitment of filters, and so that growth could come in '19, '20.\r\nSo overall, the structural drivers remain in the medium term, and we expect a continued strong performance from ECT in this year.\r\nTurning now to Process Technologies. They made progress in the year, with growth in sales and profit of 7%, so a good performance overall given the change in mix, especially because of the lower contribution from licensing.\r\nSo we turn to Chemicals. First of all, good growth in catalysts but slower in the licensing side. Sales were up, as you can see, as a division -- as a sector by 4% at constant currency with higher sales of ammonia and formaldehyde technologies but lower demand in methanol. And that's the normal cycle. It seems to work on a sort of a 2-year cycle. So last year, we had low sales of ammonia and higher sales of methanol. This year, it's the other way around. And in the year we're now in, it's probably going to revert back to high demand for methanol and slightly lower for ammonia, so a sort of 2-year cycle and slightly out of -- they seem to be out of phase at the moment.\r\nAnd on the licensing side, that was also down. Although we won 6 new licenses, they'll be relatively low value and not unexpected but principally due to the slowdown in China, where there's now sufficient capacity for many of the petrochemical plants that we have our licensing technology. So we're well working on a whole series of new technologies such as VCM, but they take time to come into market. And really, the first challenge is getting that first reference site, having one customer to have the confidence to build up the first plant. Once you get one plant, then you're more likely to get others following, but the first reference site does take quite some time. And we're also working on a number of bio-based feedstocks for licensing technologies too.\r\nSo for licensing, I think it will be lower again in '15, '16, the year we're now in, but then in '16, '17 and beyond, we'll then start to see a recovery and return to growth.\r\nOn the Oil and Gas side, they performed well across all sectors, with sales up by 11%. Now remember here, about 75% of our Oil and Gas business is to mid and downstream sector, mostly catalysts and additives and not services, so relatively less impacted by the lower oil price. So over the last year, we've seen good demand supported by tighter fuel specifications and lower emissions for refineries requiring our products.\r\nHydrogen has done well this year, supported by new plant builds, particularly in the Middle East, which has helped. And on the additives side, high-performance materials rather than emission materials have allowed us to grow that business as well.\r\nOn the Diagnostic Services side, that's our Tracerco business, they had a good year, but this is the business that has the upstream exposure. A lot of the work they do is on acid integrity and acid performance improvements. New products are going well and showing good customer demand, but the oil price fall has seen a reduction in activity, and that will probably impact this business in this year.\r\nSo looking ahead, as we said in January, we see a short-term hiatus. It's going to be tough for this business to grow this year, but the long-term drivers remain good.\r\nSo this year, it's really around good demand for catalysts I think we'll still see in PT. And the oil and gases' business should continue to perform well, but the licensing side, as I've already said, will offset that growth on the catalyst side. And we've got 3 reasons here principally why the licensing income is dropping, and it's really partly to do with the coal-to-SNG projects in China. Those are being slowed down. But also, the petrochemical capacity is pretty much in line with the market demand today.\r\nThe long-term drivers, though, remain in place for this division, so although we expect this year to be broadly in line with last year, I think that outlook for the longer term is good. And to be honest on the outlook for this year, this is the area of risk in this whole -- when we look at outlooks. There's probably more risk on the downside in this sector -- in this division, I should say, than perhaps any others when we're looking in the outlook for this year.\r\nOn Precious Metal Products division, it's been impacted, as we know, by the Anglo contract, which has now completely gone through our numbers. And this probably is the last time you'll hear us talking about Anglo, in relation to our results at least. So at constant rates, down 9% at sales level and 21% at the operating profit level. Of course, that was also -- the sales were also lower because of weakness in our Gold and Silver Refining business, which had a relatively poor sales performance in this year, but of course we've now sold that and we won't have that going forward.\r\nSo a difficult year for the business but still a high-margin business. And the return on capital, you can see it's dropped quite a long way, but I think that should recover and should, in the medium term, be around 30%. That's the sort of the level of return on capital that we should be achieving from this division, still a high-margin, \"high return on capital\" division.\r\nOn the Services side, I've already mentioned the Anglo contract, but it's been a mixed year for Refining and recycling. Volumes are slightly higher overall, helped by the Stillwater contract, which has boosted our palladium intakes. But we have seen on an intake basis some falloff in the fourth quarter, so the first calendar quarter of this year, and those sale -- that intake volume responding to lower prices will then start impacting our results in this first quarter of this financial year.\r\nAnd also, our mix has been less favorable. There's been a lot more filters coming through our spent autocatalyst feedstock inputs -- intakes, I would say. And filters, if you think they started being fitted to cars about 8 to 10 years ago, so now they started to be scrapped, and they take quite a lot more time to process through our refinery. And that's one of the reasons why we've had increase in our pgm balances, because we're still working on that mix and how we improve the performance of the refineries and make sure that we deal with these issues going forward.\r\nSo we're working on efficiencies. And we'll continue to invest in those and continue work on improving in '15, '16, but remember, of course, the pgm prices do impact our business. And we've said before that a 10% movement in the pgm price for a full year is about a GBP 5 million impact to sales and profit.\r\nOn the manufacturing side, steady overall but lots of moving parts here. Relatively mature, as you know, as we talked about in January, high margin, relatively higher return on capital but relatively growth-limited in some of these businesses. Previously, we've focused on that, return on capital and margin, and now we're looking for some growth. So more investment coming in, but that will take some time before that yields benefits.\r\nBut looking at the businesses in the year. Noble Metals has some good demand for its pgm gauzes but is offset by other industrial product weaknesses. And our Advanced Glass Technologies business track the global car production for automated glass, and we're increasing our presence in Asia, where of course that's where the growth in the car market is.\r\nSo looking ahead for PMP. It will be a tough year in this year, but also we're investing for growth.\r\nOn the Refining side, the shift in mix that I mentioned about will continue to impact us this year, but we are looking for efficiency improvements. And we are also investing in a refinery in China. That's a 10 to -- about GBP 15 million investment, initially to support industrial products. But going forward, it will be available, obviously, to us when cars start being scrapped in China, but that's not for a few years yet.\r\nOn the manufacturing side, relatively stable. We're investing. And I think there might be a little bit of growth this year in that business, but going forward, the growth should come in the years -- in the future.\r\nSo of course, the outlook for this division will be significantly down, primarily because, of course, we no longer have the gold and silver business but also because of the impacts of the things that I've talked about on the refinery side.\r\nFine Chemicals had a good year, sales up by 3% and profit by 7%; a good effort by the API team, manufacturing team, particularly on process efficiencies and on the raw material improvements in price, et cetera.\r\nThe sale of the Research Chemicals business, as I said, we've -- we're in advanced negotiations there. We hope to be in a position to close that this year, calendar year. And we'll announce in the near future when we're ready to do that. It's a good business, but it doesn't fit with our business model going forward.\r\nWhat we're doing now, though, across the group business is leverage our synergies between our API Manufacturing businesses; and our catalysts (sic) [Catalysis] and Chiral Technologies businesses, CCT. And that leverage on synergies have started to have an effect. In the year, demand for our APIs across our portfolio was mixed, but steady growth overall. And we continue to develop new products and new opportunities.\r\nOn the Research Chemicals side, just to finish and help you. The sales, as you can see, were GBP 77 million in the year. The margin of this business is around about 20%. So you can work out what the impact will be for your numbers for the year, obviously depending upon when we finally complete.\r\nLooking ahead, the robust longer-term growth potential for the division is still there. We expect good growth in our API Manufacturing businesses this year and beyond. We continue to invest in the developments of more and more complex APIs. Not all of them are in controlled substances, so we're -- more and more diversification of the APIs that we're going after. \r\nAnd just last year, we bought a new facility in Scotland, in the -- just north of Carlisle. And that's a bit like the facility we bought in the U.S. If you remember, a couple of years ago, we bought a facility off Lonza in Conshohocken in Pennsylvania. And this is a large plant, has been a former GSK one, that we believe that we can use. We'll spend a little bit of money, a little bit of CapEx getting it up and running. And then in mid-2016, it will be well -- give us an opportunity to provide growth for our business here in Europe.\r\nSo the strong drivers remain. We continue to work on the formulation and development of new generics. These take 3 or 4 years once the ANDA has been filed and approved by the development agency, then 3 or 4 years before you actually start seeing real revenues, so we've got to have a number of these to make sure that we can grow and provide that portfolio of products and not rely on just 1 or 2.\r\nSo we expect this year to make good progress in this division, of course excluding the impact of the sale of Research Chemicals.\r\nFinally, New Businesses. Made good progress in the year, principally as a result of the acquisitions they've done both in Battery Technologies but also subsequently in the Atmosphere Control Technologies acquisition we did recently.\r\nBattery Technologies, the acquisitions, we're working on integrating those into the business. And we like what we see, so far, and it provides us good opportunities to develop this business in the longer term. And with Battery Technologies, there's only a modest loss in the year, and the 2 materials acquisitions were slightly profitable.\r\nOn Fuel Cells, there's more and more activity going on, as you know, across the world. And we're working very closely with a number of the OEMs. We aren't on any of their platforms yet, but we're working very hard. And we're working with many of them and hope to be, in the next 2 or 3 years, on some of those platforms as they continue to get into larger-scale production.\r\nSo overall, good progress and a higher loss, though, as you can see, as we continue to invest in the business. And obviously, some of the integration costs are in here too.\r\nLooking ahead, we continue to want to deepen the portfolio, and this is all about providing the next engines of growth for the group. Battery Technologies, this year, we expect to be breakeven if we exclude the integration costs. Atmospheric control, the acquisition, StePac that we bought just last month, expect sales, as it says, of about GBP 20 million with a small operating profit. So overall, we continue to invest in areas where we can use our chemistry skills and our application expertise to provide those next engines of growth. And we still think, for '15, '16, we'll see a modest reduction in the loss this year, but then hopefully, we're still well placed for breakeven in '17, '18, again as we said in January, at the Investor Day.\r\nSo just putting it all together. I've gone through each of the individual division's outlooks, so if we look at the group as a whole: We expect the underlying growth to -- in the continuing businesses to be good and to continue to be strong, but because of the disposals, the net-net, you end up with the '15, '16 numbers being just slightly ahead of '14, '15, but we're very well placed for the long-term growth in the business.\r\nSo to finish up and just to recap before questions.\r\nI think we've had good progress in the year led particularly by ECT but with EPS up 6%. We're focusing on attractive markets, and we'll continue to keep that chemistry and applications focus going forward as we manage the portfolio. And as I've just said, we expect '15, '16 to be slightly ahead of '14, '15, but the long-term drivers remain strong and in place.\r\nAnd with that, I'll -- just give us a few minutes or a few seconds to set up, and we'll take your questions.",
      "transcript_text3": "Okay, would any of you like to ask the first one? Right, we've got some microphones. And Laurent's got his hand up. You could say your name and where you're from.\n\n---\n\nIt's Laurent Favre from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. I've got 2 questions. The first one is probably for John, on ECT in North America. In the first half, if I remember correctly, sales were slightly ahead. For the full year, they're slightly below the year before. Can you talk about what happened really on this mix topic for the second half?\n\n---\n\n[indiscernible] light duty business.\n\n---\n\nYes, light duty, yes, yes. So can you talk a bit more about this mix impact for the second half and whether or not we'll see that again in the first half? Because I suppose that's an issue that is not just a one-off on a 6-month basis. And then the second question is probably for you, Robert, on the balance sheet and how you're going to balance M&A and cash returns given this improvement on working capital already in April, the disposal to come through, cash flow conversion that is going to improve this year compared to last year. So how do you think about M&A and cash returns?\n\n---\n\nJohn, do you want to go first since he asked first?\n\n---\n\nYes. I think, on our light duty business in North America, the mix change that we're talking about there is a customer mix change. In Europe, a lot of the mix that we talk about; is both customers and models, so whether this is going to continue. I think our light duty business is cyclical, as you know, so yes, it will continue for a period, but we do expect recovery. And in fact, today, I just told Robert that we have won some new business that should see that turn around. So I don't see that as much of a worry, and it's not a very big impact on our total business.\n\n---\n\nSo this is just your customers selling smaller cars or small engines or...\n\n---\n\nIt's a combination of a few things, yes.\n\n---\n\nSo we always get asked this question about the balance sheet. And we've said for many years that we're not going to sit on and hoard on cash just for the sake of hoarding cash. As you know, and we talked about it a bit in January, we are looking at M&A across the organization, particularly in New Businesses. It's to create that route to market and the access to technologies, sometimes, we need to do some M&A, but it's a balance. And we will always review the balance sheet. We always look at -- when and if there's an appropriate time to return capital to shareholders, then we'll do it. We've done it before and we'll do it again, but on the other hand, we need to maintain our flexibility to make sure that we can take advantage of opportunities as they see -- as they come. But our ratios and our target ratio, Den, I think hasn't changed.\n\n---\n\nNo, it hasn't. Like Robert's comments, my view on this is we're growing the company. We're looking at investing and growing the company. That's what we want to do, but as Robert said today, sale of Research Chemicals, we're not going to hang onto the cash forever without doing anything with it.\n\n---\n\nAnd I'll just sneak another one in on portfolio management.\n\n---\n\nSorry?\n\n---\n\nOn portfolio management, you mentioned that you felt you had made good progress. Is there anything in the portfolio right now that you would argue is still noncore, of the size of Research Chemicals, so something that we would all basically see and care about?\n\n---\n\nNo. Was that clear? Yes, [indiscernible], please.\n\n---\n\nIt's, yes, Peter Cartwright, Fiske. Could I ask you on the battery materials, your investment in lithium iron phosphate? What's your existing customer base? And where do you think you're taking that division? And perhaps a comment on where you think Tesla are taking their battery chemistry.\n\n---\n\nWell, I can give you an answer, but I think it's better to ask the man who really knows, so Nick, do you want to ask -- answer this one?\n\n---\n\nI will have a go -- is this on?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think it is.\n\n---\n\nI'll have a go, or ask someone else who already knows as well Peter, I suppose. The -- I think we've said before, lithium iron phosphate is an entry chemistry for us. It's based on availability. I don't think I need to get into our customer base. I think it will be clear to say it's principally Asian. And it's where high power matters. So that's both the Chinese EV market but power applications more generally. The strategy will be extend that chemistry portfolio, and clearly, I gave the clue there. We've got a high-power chemistry. We want a high-energy chemistry. And so clearly, we are continuing to evaluate the alternative chemistries both with internal research but also external opportunities for in-licensing or possibly acquisition of those technology. Comments on Tesla: They have high energy, yes, because they're kind of driving for the engines for cars with it. So they remain, as they seek to expand that market, a potential customer in the future for us once we deliver high-energy chemistries. Was that clear?\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nOkay, Martin? And one here.\n\n---\n\nMartin Evans, JPMorgan Cazenove. Just Fuel Cells; and maybe a question for Nick again, on the new business. I mean losses yet again this year, which you seem quite happy to tolerate on the basis, as you said, Robert, that you're working with the OEMs on new platforms, but there have been many, many years of these continuing fuel cell losses. Can you just explain, is it simply that the market is incredibly challenging and changing and you have to respond to that without getting a return? Or -- and probably a difficult question to answer structurally, is it -- is there something wrong with Johnson Matthey's particular fuel cell platform?\n\n---\n\nI'll have a start and then maybe let Nick off and Larry a go. So we look at this frequently, as you would. When you've got a loss-making business, you look at it and to see whether it fits and whether you want to keep a hold of it. We reviewed it again with the board just this year. And the outlook for the market it started -- this is technology that we have and we're actually pretty good, so it's not about our technology being good enough. We think our technology is pretty world class. The challenge is, though, where's the market. And how is the market going to develop? And we're now at a stage where legislation is coming in or is in. Or it's coming in, in California and Japan and Korea. And so that is going to potentially encourage, and you're starting to see, launches, tangible launches of fuel-cell vehicles in the market. The challenge for us then is to be on those platforms. We're discussing, we're working with those -- many of those OEMs that we're not yet on those platforms because mainly, at this stage, because it's very much R&D still for them, they're not large-scale manufacturer. So they're basically doing their own in-house development today and in-house manufacturing today, but going forward, you'll start -- they'll start looking for external people to supply. And we think we're well placed. And we still think today that it's a good investment for the shareholders to continue to look at fuel cells. And it'll -- and that's why we'll keep on going. Would you say anything more, Larry?\n\n---\n\nI don't think you need to say anything more, no. It is about having technology. I'll -- I might be even a little bolder and say we are -- we have leading technology in the membrane electrode assembly today out there, but it's about waiting for the market to develop. And it wouldn't take very much penetration in the automotive market, low single digits, very low single-digit penetration in the market, for this to be a rather attractive business. That's what we're planning for.\n\n---\n\nSo within your breakeven target within 3 years in new business, does that assume that the losses individually within Fuel Cells trend down? Or is the breakeven because the other bids, the acquisitions begin to more than offset that and Fuel Cells remain a small loss maker?\n\n---\n\nIt's both.\n\n---\n\nOkay, any other questions? Yes, Simon?\n\n---\n\nSimon Fickling, Exane. Could I ask on Process Technologies? And so we have the update in January. I'm wondering what may have changed in your view on the outlook since then. Oil price is slightly higher, but in particular, in the guidance, you had a very strong Q4. And in the guidance for the cash flow, you flagged that there was -- looked to be quite a strong order book in Process Technologies. Can you just help us sort of pick apart those areas and sort of what expectations around licensing and around the catalyst builds in the refinery business? What may have changed since the update in January, when we all went over it in quite a bit of detail?\n\n---\n\nSure. Well, since Geoff did the update in January, maybe, Geoff, you're best placed to give an overview.\n\n---\n\nYes. Sorry, who asked? Okay, sorry, I'll get out the light. I guess, when I think about it, I'm not sure that a whole lot did change from the guidance that we were trying to give you. I think the year came in roughly where we thought it would. And I'm not sure that the outlook changes significantly from where we were -- sorry, you had something else to -- trying to pick apart the licensing, the licensing side of things, yes.\n\n---\n\nYes, I mean, just with the strong Q4 and then some inventory build ahead of expected strong start to the year. Just...\n\n---\n\nWell, the -- a lot of the inventory in the working capital build was really due to the strong fourth quarter that we had, so -- and some of the inventory build is just our expectations of what's coming along for us. In terms of the licensing, yes, that didn't really feature prominently in the fourth quarter. And as I think we've noted just from the number of licenses we've sold, we don't expect great recovery of that anytime soon. But going for this year, we're probably expecting that the number of licenses we sell will be more in line with what we've seen kind of the average in the past, so a better recovery, but I wouldn't expect a huge amount of cash from that straightaway.\n\n---\n\nYes? Sorry, you didn't have your hand up.\n\n---\n\nOliver Reiff, Deutsche Bank. Can I just ask one question on HDD in China and what you're seeing in terms of momentum on the ground post clean or low-sulfur fuel being available since the 1st of January this year and whether you're seeing a gearing up or an acceleration in uptake of -- I mean, of catalysts?\n\n---\n\nJohn, do you want to take that?\n\n---\n\nYes. I think, this year, so far, has been a kind of a consolidation of a lot of the new legislation that Beijing in particular has and national standards have been working on. And it's all been changing, changing, changing. This week, Beijing announced that, as of 2 days ago, 1st of June, they were going to implement Beijing V. And they were also going to -- they also announced a strict enforcement of the regulation. So one of the things that happened on the light duty side of things in the past was the enforcement, took about 3 to 4 years after the implementation of the legislation. So in my opinion, the Chinese government is really starting to get organized to be able to tackle the problems that they have in air pollution, and things are really starting to come together. Nationwide standard for the nationwide equivalent of Euro V looks to be coming out in January of 2018. And the fuel, as you talked about, is going to be available in -- is available now in 10 provinces. And then starting from January 2017, all that cleaner fuel will be available nationwide, so that's happening. And then Beijing VI, it also looks like they're going to pull that forward, so I think, directionally, things are looking good. We're still -- when is that going to flow through into our numbers? Probably it might be another couple of 3 to 6 months, but it's happening. And it now looks like they're organized to be able to make it happen.\n\n---\n\nAnd I think it's what's encouraging is that enforcement because it's all very well having legislation, but if you don't enforce it, then some people don't fit in that. So that's encouraging. There was a question. Turn here [indiscernible], if we can...\n\n---\n\nIt's Joe Dewhurst from UBS. I've got 2 questions, 1 on performance technologies and the other around the packaging acquisition. But first one, performance technologies, with the growth in the Oil and Gas, first of all, with that 10% growth, how much was sort of the hydrogen and FCC? And then how much of the FCC is maybe linked to some of the sharp or reasonable increases we've seen in miles driven? Particularly in the U.S., we're seeing a pickup there. And then just on the packaging, with the acquisition now, I mean, where do you see that eventually going? Do you see yourselves eventually being something sort of like a Tetra Pak? Or was it effectively selling equipment and ideas, or was just out-licensing for food packaging or packaging in general?\n\n---\n\nOkay, I'm going to delegate both of these questions, I think. So Geoff, do you want to have a go on the first one, about the Oil and Gas business?\n\n---\n\nYes. So on the FCC, on the FCC additives part of Process Technologies, yes, the refineries, typically in -- especially the U.S., have been running hard. So that is good for our business. Sorry, I didn't quite understand the hydrogen part.\n\n---\n\nYes, just what's the kind of the split? Said in other words, you have 10% growth. How much was hydrogen versus the sort of the FCC? And then...\n\n---\n\n[indiscernible] in the -- it is split between -- roughly split between the two. So a very good year in hydrogen. Robert alluded to we have good success in new plant sales, Russia and Middle East, so -- and then the additives was good as well.\n\n---\n\nAnd then with the additives, this is then very much then correlated with the miles driven. Is it -- is there sort of end-of-year kind of impact at all?\n\n---\n\nA lot of it's based upon -- well, it's a number of factors: the pollution that they're trying to get at, how hard the refineries are running, some of the end products that they might try to preferentially make. So it's a cocktail of things that happen. And we're in pretty good space for that right now.\n\n---\n\nJust that we do give you -- in the breakdown on the PT slide, I think, on Slide 23, if I can see it, we do give the breakdown between hydrogen and additives. And I think we gave it last year too. And it's in the slide so you can see the relative growth between the 2 businesses. Nick, do you want to talk about why we're not going to be Tetra Pak?\n\n---\n\nThe -- and we deliberately call this business, we gave the update in January, atmospheric control to not -- we're not going to be a packaging company. Johnson Matthey is about advanced materials, and atmospheric control talks about the ability to subtly absorb modified gases within a closed environment. It's what it's about. Now you can do that as a package or saying that goes in as a fill -- is the sort of infill within the package or integrate that within the packaging material itself. However -- and this acquisition gives us some background and market access but also technology on film and film integration because it's an advanced film manufacturer. So there's different routes to market, but in the end, our core competency and the value we'll bring to that problem of food wastage is about advanced materials. And delivery of those will be through various routes, but we will not be a large film blower or cardboard folder. We're not going to be. That industry is enormous, well served, and we would not bring any value to it, and so we're not going to go there.\n\n---\n\nOkay, there was a question in front.\n\n---\n\nCharles Pick of Numis. A couple of questions on the Precious Metal Products divisions, please. You've given us the sales figure for the gold and silver operations. Is it possible to give the EBIT that was included last year and what the refinery intake volume decline was in that Q4 period; and also say a little bit more about the new products being development on the manufacturing side, please? And just a couple on the ECT side: The margin is down 60 basis points second half on first half. Is there any particular reason for that? I think you've always emphasized Q4 is a very strong period for ECT normally. And also, capacity use ratio there, it was -- I think, a year ago, you said it was about 70% for the 15 plants you've got. Can you update that, please?\n\n---\n\nI think you managed to get about 6 questions in 1, which I think that's the record. Just briefly, on PMP, the answer is yes. We could give you the gold and silver EBIT. We're not going to. Sorry. But I think it is around GBP 10 million. The exact number, I'm not going to give you. Refining volume is down about 10% in the first -- fourth quarter. And some of the growth in new products in the marketing -- manufacturing area, it's a range of different things. This is a sort of -- we're looking at a whole range of different products and different areas. None of them are going to move the needle for you, I don't think, initially at this stage, but there's a range of different things which will give growth when we get to year 2 and beyond. But it will -- it's not just one particular product. John, do you want to talk about ECT?\n\n---\n\nYes. The first half to second half, and I guess you're talking about operating margin, not sales margin, the operating margin, I think, was impacted by some of the things that Robert talked about. In the first half of the year, when we were taking some of our double-layer catalysts and moving them to single-layer catalysts, that effectively freed up production capacity at no extra cost. We already have the people. We already have the plants in place. And I think, progressively, as we went through the year, you had less and less opportunity to be able to use that leverage that we had in the first half, not to say that it went to 0, but it's been reduced. So I think that's what caused that first half-second half effect. And then capacity utilization, fortunately or unfortunately, we added capacity in China right at the end of the year, so our sort of internal published numbers didn't really move very much. And we're still on the kind of effective capacity utilization range of around 75%, but what has happened is that some of our factories have actually -- due to these reasons of filling up that capacity through the year, a couple of our factories are now running in the 80% to 90% capacity utilization. So as we move in, when it becomes more clear what's go to happen on some of the gasoline filter business that we're going to have to think about over the next kind of 6 to 12 months, we're going to have to think about whether we do need some additional capacity to make certain products.\n\n---\n\nOkay, any more for any more? Yes, one at the back there. Sorry, I can't see you at all really. I saw a hand.\n\n---\n\nIt's Evgenia Molotova from Berenberg. And I had a question on Process Technologies as well, on licensing, because in the past years, you've benefited from strong capacity increase in oxo alcohols, I guess, in China. And you sold  lots of licenses. So the recovery in couple of years, is it predicated on new cycle of building capacities for oxo alcohols, et cetera so the demand will be strong enough to absorb both the capacities that is built within 2 years? Or do you think that the new technology, like we see them, will pick up and this will bring you the growth? And the second question, on Chemicals' catalysts. You are not losing market share, by any chance?\n\n---\n\nWhen you say chemical catalyst, what -- which bit do you mean?\n\n---\n\nFor Chemicals -- no, I just -- it's a general question. I'm not saying -- yes, I just wanted to -- not Oil and Gas...\n\n---\n\nWithin process...\n\n---\n\nYes, it was in process -- within Process Technologies.\n\n---\n\nWell, I think I can answer the first -- the second one quite easy. I think the answer is no. Larry, do you want to share a little bit? Do you want to have a go with the last item?\n\n---\n\nSure. I mean you're licensing question about oxo alcohols in China. As you see, in any kind of petrochemical sort of chemical, you will go through a bit of a chemical cycle with ups and downs. What we saw through the years with oxo alcohol is there was a great demand sort of quickly then new plant builds, i.e. licensing for Johnson Matthey, are coming -- well, that was a few years back. You saw those. Now that capacity is online, so supply and demand were in balance, but that said, there is continuing growth happening in the oxo alcohol space. And we will see licenses. It -- they will just come in a more controlled environment. So back to the guidance, at a general level, more around that 8 licenses per year versus the kind of peak numbers that we saw around '14.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Oh, another one. Do you have a second to go, Peter? I think you are.\n\n---\n\nYes, [indiscernible], a quick one. It's that could you expand on the filters for gasoline? Because Ricardo mentioned this yesterday but specifically with reference to China. I mean, have you been caught on the hop, anything like that? Or did it come out of the blue?\n\n---\n\nCan you imagine John being caught on the hop? John?\n\n---\n\nMany, many of our customers have been worrying about that issue or planning for that issue for quite some time. And I think that timing is a little bit tight, as China moves up the timing for some of the things that are going to require filters, but I think most of our customers are -- have been on the plan there. And they're well placed to be able to hit the target. It's going to be tough, but I think they'll be okay.\n\n---\n\nWhat's the specific driving force for gasoline?\n\n---\n\nFor gasoline?\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nWhat do you mean, \"What's the specific driving force for gasoline?\"\n\n---\n\nAs to why you have to fit filters for gasoline.\n\n---\n\nIt's all related to -- well, it's again the health effects and ultrafine particles in gasoline vehicles.\n\n---\n\nPeople think that diesel is the only cars that produce particulate. Gasoline cars produce quite a lot of particulate too. It's just much finer, and so you can't see it. So now what's happening with regulations, and that's what 6c is all about here in Europe too, is about reducing the number of particulates in the atmosphere from both diesel and gasoline cars.\n\n---\n\nSo they're both going to be banned then.\n\n---\n\nAny more? No? Well, then, thanks very much for coming indeed. And we'll see you again in 6 months' time.\r\nThank you.",
      "transcript_text4": "【回答: Robert MacLeod (Executives)】\nOkay, would any of you like to ask the first one? Right, we've got some microphones. And Laurent's got his hand up. You could say your name and where you're from.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Laurent Favre (Analysts)】\nIt's Laurent Favre from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. I've got 2 questions. The first one is probably for John, on ECT in North America. In the first half, if I remember correctly, sales were slightly ahead. For the full year, they're slightly below the year before. Can you talk about what happened really on this mix topic for the second half?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Walker (Executives)】\n[indiscernible] light duty business.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Laurent Favre (Analysts)】\nYes, light duty, yes, yes. So can you talk a bit more about this mix impact for the second half and whether or not we'll see that again in the first half? Because I suppose that's an issue that is not just a one-off on a 6-month basis. And then the second question is probably for you, Robert, on the balance sheet and how you're going to balance M&A and cash returns given this improvement on working capital already in April, the disposal to come through, cash flow conversion that is going to improve this year compared to last year. So how do you think about M&A and cash returns?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert MacLeod (Executives)】\nJohn, do you want to go first since he asked first?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Walker (Executives)】\nYes. I think, on our light duty business in North America, the mix change that we're talking about there is a customer mix change. In Europe, a lot of the mix that we talk about; is both customers and models, so whether this is going to continue. I think our light duty business is cyclical, as you know, so yes, it will continue for a period, but we do expect recovery. And in fact, today, I just told Robert that we have won some new business that should see that turn around. So I don't see that as much of a worry, and it's not a very big impact on our total business.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Laurent Favre (Analysts)】\nSo this is just your customers selling smaller cars or small engines or...\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Walker (Executives)】\nIt's a combination of a few things, yes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert MacLeod (Executives)】\nSo we always get asked this question about the balance sheet. And we've said for many years that we're not going to sit on and hoard on cash just for the sake of hoarding cash. As you know, and we talked about it a bit in January, we are looking at M&A across the organization, particularly in New Businesses. It's to create that route to market and the access to technologies, sometimes, we need to do some M&A, but it's a balance. And we will always review the balance sheet. We always look at -- when and if there's an appropriate time to return capital to shareholders, then we'll do it. We've done it before and we'll do it again, but on the other hand, we need to maintain our flexibility to make sure that we can take advantage of opportunities as they see -- as they come. But our ratios and our target ratio, Den, I think hasn't changed.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Den Jones (Executives)】\nNo, it hasn't. Like Robert's comments, my view on this is we're growing the company. We're looking at investing and growing the company. That's what we want to do, but as Robert said today, sale of Research Chemicals, we're not going to hang onto the cash forever without doing anything with it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Laurent Favre (Analysts)】\nAnd I'll just sneak another one in on portfolio management.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert MacLeod (Executives)】\nSorry?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Laurent Favre (Analysts)】\nOn portfolio management, you mentioned that you felt you had made good progress. Is there anything in the portfolio right now that you would argue is still noncore, of the size of Research Chemicals, so something that we would all basically see and care about?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert MacLeod (Executives)】\nNo. Was that clear? Yes, [indiscernible], please.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Peter Cartwright (Analysts)】\nIt's, yes, Peter Cartwright, Fiske. Could I ask you on the battery materials, your investment in lithium iron phosphate? What's your existing customer base? And where do you think you're taking that division? And perhaps a comment on where you think Tesla are taking their battery chemistry.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert MacLeod (Executives)】\nWell, I can give you an answer, but I think it's better to ask the man who really knows, so Nick, do you want to ask -- answer this one?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nick Garner (Executives)】\nI will have a go -- is this on?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert MacLeod (Executives)】\nYes, I think it is.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nick Garner (Executives)】\nI'll have a go, or ask someone else who already knows as well Peter, I suppose. The -- I think we've said before, lithium iron phosphate is an entry chemistry for us. It's based on availability. I don't think I need to get into our customer base. I think it will be clear to say it's principally Asian. And it's where high power matters. So that's both the Chinese EV market but power applications more generally. The strategy will be extend that chemistry portfolio, and clearly, I gave the clue there. We've got a high-power chemistry. We want a high-energy chemistry. And so clearly, we are continuing to evaluate the alternative chemistries both with internal research but also external opportunities for in-licensing or possibly acquisition of those technology. Comments on Tesla: They have high energy, yes, because they're kind of driving for the engines for cars with it. So they remain, as they seek to expand that market, a potential customer in the future for us once we deliver high-energy chemistries. Was that clear?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Peter Cartwright (Analysts)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert MacLeod (Executives)】\nOkay, Martin? And one here.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Martin Evans (Analysts)】\nMartin Evans, JPMorgan Cazenove. Just Fuel Cells; and maybe a question for Nick again, on the new business. I mean losses yet again this year, which you seem quite happy to tolerate on the basis, as you said, Robert, that you're working with the OEMs on new platforms, but there have been many, many years of these continuing fuel cell losses. Can you just explain, is it simply that the market is incredibly challenging and changing and you have to respond to that without getting a return? Or -- and probably a difficult question to answer structurally, is it -- is there something wrong with Johnson Matthey's particular fuel cell platform?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert MacLeod (Executives)】\nI'll have a start and then maybe let Nick off and Larry a go. So we look at this frequently, as you would. When you've got a loss-making business, you look at it and to see whether it fits and whether you want to keep a hold of it. We reviewed it again with the board just this year. And the outlook for the market it started -- this is technology that we have and we're actually pretty good, so it's not about our technology being good enough. We think our technology is pretty world class. The challenge is, though, where's the market. And how is the market going to develop? And we're now at a stage where legislation is coming in or is in. Or it's coming in, in California and Japan and Korea. And so that is going to potentially encourage, and you're starting to see, launches, tangible launches of fuel-cell vehicles in the market. The challenge for us then is to be on those platforms. We're discussing, we're working with those -- many of those OEMs that we're not yet on those platforms because mainly, at this stage, because it's very much R&D still for them, they're not large-scale manufacturer. So they're basically doing their own in-house development today and in-house manufacturing today, but going forward, you'll start -- they'll start looking for external people to supply. And we think we're well placed. And we still think today that it's a good investment for the shareholders to continue to look at fuel cells. And it'll -- and that's why we'll keep on going. Would you say anything more, Larry?\n\n---\n\n【回答: L. Pentz (Executives)】\nI don't think you need to say anything more, no. It is about having technology. I'll -- I might be even a little bolder and say we are -- we have leading technology in the membrane electrode assembly today out there, but it's about waiting for the market to develop. And it wouldn't take very much penetration in the automotive market, low single digits, very low single-digit penetration in the market, for this to be a rather attractive business. That's what we're planning for.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Martin Evans (Analysts)】\nSo within your breakeven target within 3 years in new business, does that assume that the losses individually within Fuel Cells trend down? Or is the breakeven because the other bids, the acquisitions begin to more than offset that and Fuel Cells remain a small loss maker?\n\n---\n\n【回答: L. Pentz (Executives)】\nIt's both.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert MacLeod (Executives)】\nOkay, any other questions? Yes, Simon?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Simon Fickling (Analysts)】\nSimon Fickling, Exane. Could I ask on Process Technologies? And so we have the update in January. I'm wondering what may have changed in your view on the outlook since then. Oil price is slightly higher, but in particular, in the guidance, you had a very strong Q4. And in the guidance for the cash flow, you flagged that there was -- looked to be quite a strong order book in Process Technologies. Can you just help us sort of pick apart those areas and sort of what expectations around licensing and around the catalyst builds in the refinery business? What may have changed since the update in January, when we all went over it in quite a bit of detail?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert MacLeod (Executives)】\nSure. Well, since Geoff did the update in January, maybe, Geoff, you're best placed to give an overview.\n\n---\n\n【回答: G. Otterman (Executives)】\nYes. Sorry, who asked? Okay, sorry, I'll get out the light. I guess, when I think about it, I'm not sure that a whole lot did change from the guidance that we were trying to give you. I think the year came in roughly where we thought it would. And I'm not sure that the outlook changes significantly from where we were -- sorry, you had something else to -- trying to pick apart the licensing, the licensing side of things, yes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Simon Fickling (Analysts)】\nYes, I mean, just with the strong Q4 and then some inventory build ahead of expected strong start to the year. Just...\n\n---\n\n【回答: G. Otterman (Executives)】\nWell, the -- a lot of the inventory in the working capital build was really due to the strong fourth quarter that we had, so -- and some of the inventory build is just our expectations of what's coming along for us. In terms of the licensing, yes, that didn't really feature prominently in the fourth quarter. And as I think we've noted just from the number of licenses we've sold, we don't expect great recovery of that anytime soon. But going for this year, we're probably expecting that the number of licenses we sell will be more in line with what we've seen kind of the average in the past, so a better recovery, but I wouldn't expect a huge amount of cash from that straightaway.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert MacLeod (Executives)】\nYes? Sorry, you didn't have your hand up.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Oliver Reiff (Analysts)】\nOliver Reiff, Deutsche Bank. Can I just ask one question on HDD in China and what you're seeing in terms of momentum on the ground post clean or low-sulfur fuel being available since the 1st of January this year and whether you're seeing a gearing up or an acceleration in uptake of -- I mean, of catalysts?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert MacLeod (Executives)】\nJohn, do you want to take that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Walker (Executives)】\nYes. I think, this year, so far, has been a kind of a consolidation of a lot of the new legislation that Beijing in particular has and national standards have been working on. And it's all been changing, changing, changing. This week, Beijing announced that, as of 2 days ago, 1st of June, they were going to implement Beijing V.

Nationwide standard for the nationwide equivalent of Euro V looks to be coming out in January of 2018. And the fuel, as you talked about, is going to be available in -- is available now in 10 provinces. And then starting from January 2017, all that cleaner fuel will be available nationwide, so that's happening. And then Beijing VI, it also looks like they're going to pull that forward, so I think, directionally, things are looking good. We're still -- when is that going to flow through into our numbers? Probably it might be another couple of 3 to 6 months, but it's happening. And it now looks like they're organized to be able to make it happen.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert MacLeod (Executives)】\nAnd I think it's what's encouraging is that enforcement because it's all very well having legislation, but if you don't enforce it, then some people don't fit in that. So that's encouraging. There was a question. Turn here [indiscernible], if we can...\n\n---\n\n【質問: Joe Dewhurst (Analysts)】\nIt's Joe Dewhurst from UBS. I've got 2 questions, 1 on performance technologies and the other around the packaging acquisition. But first one, performance technologies, with the growth in the Oil and Gas, first of all, with that 10% growth, how much was sort of the hydrogen and FCC? And then how much of the FCC is maybe linked to some of the sharp or reasonable increases we've seen in miles driven? Particularly in the U.S., we're seeing a pickup there. And then just on the packaging, with the acquisition now, I mean, where do you see that eventually going? Do you see yourselves eventually being something sort of like a Tetra Pak? Or was it effectively selling equipment and ideas, or was just out-licensing for food packaging or packaging in general?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert MacLeod (Executives)】\nOkay, I'm going to delegate both of these questions, I think. So Geoff, do you want to have a go on the first one, about the Oil and Gas business?\n\n---\n\n【回答: G. Otterman (Executives)】\nYes. So on the FCC, on the FCC additives part of Process Technologies, yes, the refineries, typically in -- especially the U.S., have been running hard. So that is good for our business. Sorry, I didn't quite understand the hydrogen part.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Joe Dewhurst (Analysts)】\nYes, just what's the kind of the split? Said in other words, you have 10% growth. How much was hydrogen versus the sort of the FCC? And then...\n\n---\n\n【回答: G. Otterman (Executives)】\n[indiscernible] in the -- it is split between -- roughly split between the two. So a very good year in hydrogen. Robert alluded to we have good success in new plant sales, Russia and Middle East, so -- and then the additives was good as well.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Joe Dewhurst (Analysts)】\nAnd then with the additives, this is then very much then correlated with the miles driven. Is it -- is there sort of end-of-year kind of impact at all?\n\n---\n\n【回答: G. Otterman (Executives)】\nA lot of it's based upon -- well, it's a number of factors: the pollution that they're trying to get at, how hard the refineries are running, some of the end products that they might try to preferentially make. So it's a cocktail of things that happen. And we're in pretty good space for that right now.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert MacLeod (Executives)】\nJust that we do give you -- in the breakdown on the PT slide, I think, on Slide 23, if I can see it, we do give the breakdown between hydrogen and additives. And I think we gave it last year too. And it's in the slide so you can see the relative growth between the 2 businesses. Nick, do you want to talk about why we're not going to be Tetra Pak?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nick Garner (Executives)】\nThe -- and we deliberately call this business, we gave the update in January, atmospheric control to not -- we're not going to be a packaging company. Johnson Matthey is about advanced materials, and atmospheric control talks about the ability to subtly absorb modified gases within a closed environment. It's what it's about. Now you can do that as a package or saying that goes in as a fill -- is the sort of infill within the package or integrate that within the packaging material itself. However -- and this acquisition gives us some background and market access but also technology on film and film integration because it's an advanced film manufacturer. So there's different routes to market, but in the end, our core competency and the value we'll bring to that problem of food wastage is about advanced materials. And delivery of those will be through various routes, but we will not be a large film blower or cardboard folder. We're not going to be. That industry is enormous, well served, and we would not bring any value to it, and so we're not going to go there.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert MacLeod (Executives)】\nOkay, there was a question in front.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Pick (Analysts)】\nCharles Pick of Numis. A couple of questions on the Precious Metal Products divisions, please. You've given us the sales figure for the gold and silver operations. Is it possible to give the EBIT that was included last year and what the refinery intake volume decline was in that Q4 period; and also say a little bit more about the new products being development on the manufacturing side, please? And just a couple on the ECT side: The margin is down 60 basis points second half on first half. Is there any particular reason for that? I think you've always emphasized Q4 is a very strong period for ECT normally. And also, capacity use ratio there, it was -- I think, a year ago, you said it was about 70% for the 15 plants you've got. Can you update that, please?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert MacLeod (Executives)】\nI think you managed to get about 6 questions in 1, which I think that's the record. Just briefly, on PMP, the answer is yes. We could give you the gold and silver EBIT. We're not going to. Sorry. But I think it is around GBP 10 million. The exact number, I'm not going to give you. Refining volume is down about 10% in the first -- fourth quarter. And some of the growth in new products in the marketing -- manufacturing area, it's a range of different things. This is a sort of -- we're looking at a whole range of different products and different areas. None of them are going to move the needle for you, I don't think, initially at this stage, but there's a range of different things which will give growth when we get to year 2 and beyond. But it will -- it's not just one particular product. John, do you want to talk about ECT?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Walker (Executives)】\nYes. The first half to second half, and I guess you're talking about operating margin, not sales margin, the operating margin, I think, was impacted by some of the things that Robert talked about. In the first half of the year, when we were taking some of our double-layer catalysts and moving them to single-layer catalysts, that effectively freed up production capacity at no extra cost. We already have the people. We already have the plants in place. And I think, progressively, as we went through the year, you had less and less opportunity to be able to use that leverage that we had in the first half, not to say that it went to 0, but it's been reduced. So I think that's what caused that first half-second half effect. And then capacity utilization, fortunately or unfortunately, we added capacity in China right at the end of the year, so our sort of internal published numbers didn't really move very much. And we're still on the kind of effective capacity utilization range of around 75%, but what has happened is that some of our factories have actually -- due to these reasons of filling up that capacity through the year, a couple of our factories are now running in the 80% to 90% capacity utilization. So as we move in, when it becomes more clear what's go to happen on some of the gasoline filter business that we're going to have to think about over the next kind of 6 to 12 months, we're going to have to think about whether we do need some additional capacity to make certain products.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert MacLeod (Executives)】\nOkay, any more for any more? Yes, one at the back there. Sorry, I can't see you at all really. I saw a hand.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Evgenia Molotova (Analysts)】\nIt's Evgenia Molotova from Berenberg. And I had a question on Process Technologies as well, on licensing, because in the past years, you've benefited from strong capacity increase in oxo alcohols, I guess, in China. And you sold  lots of licenses. So the recovery in couple of years, is it predicated on new cycle of building capacities for oxo alcohols, et cetera so the demand will be strong enough to absorb both the capacities that is built within 2 years? Or do you think that the new technology, like we see them, will pick up and this will bring you the growth? And the second question, on Chemicals' catalysts. You are not losing market share, by any chance?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert MacLeod (Executives)】\nWhen you say chemical catalyst, what -- which bit do you mean?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Evgenia Molotova (Analysts)】\nFor Chemicals -- no, I just -- it's a general question. I'm not saying -- yes, I just wanted to -- not Oil and Gas...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert MacLeod (Executives)】\nWithin process...\n\n---\n\n【質問: Evgenia Molotova (Analysts)】\nYes, it was in process -- within Process Technologies.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert MacLeod (Executives)】\nWell, I think I can answer the first -- the second one quite easy. I think the answer is no. Larry, do you want to share a little bit? Do you want to have a go with the last item?\n\n---\n\n【回答: L. Pentz (Executives)】\nSure. I mean you're licensing question about oxo alcohols in China. As you see, in any kind of petrochemical sort of chemical, you will go through a bit of a chemical cycle with ups and downs. What we saw through the years with oxo alcohol is there was a great demand sort of quickly then new plant builds, i.e. licensing for Johnson Matthey, are coming -- well, that was a few years back. You saw those. Now that capacity is online, so supply and demand were in balance, but that said, there is continuing growth happening in the oxo alcohol space. And we will see licenses. It -- they will just come in a more controlled environment. So back to the guidance, at a general level, more around that 8 licenses per year versus the kind of peak numbers that we saw around '14.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert MacLeod (Executives)】\nOkay. Oh, another one. Do you have a second to go, Peter? I think you are.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Peter Cartwright (Analysts)】\nYes, [indiscernible], a quick one. It's that could you expand on the filters for gasoline? Because Ricardo mentioned this yesterday but specifically with reference to China. I mean, have you been caught on the hop, anything like that? Or did it come out of the blue?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert MacLeod (Executives)】\nCan you imagine John being caught on the hop? John?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Walker (Executives)】\nMany, many of our customers have been worrying about that issue or planning for that issue for quite some time. And I think that timing is a little bit tight, as China moves up the timing for some of the things that are going to require filters, but I think most of our customers are -- have been on the plan there. And they're well placed to be able to hit the target. It's going to be tough, but I think they'll be okay.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Peter Cartwright (Analysts)】\nWhat's the specific driving force for gasoline?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Walker (Executives)】\nFor gasoline?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Peter Cartwright (Analysts)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Walker (Executives)】\nWhat do you mean, \"What's the specific driving force for gasoline?\"\n\n---\n\n【質問: Peter Cartwright (Analysts)】\nAs to why you have to fit filters for gasoline.\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Walker (Executives)】\nIt's all related to -- well, it's again the health effects and ultrafine particles in gasoline vehicles.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert MacLeod (Executives)】\nPeople think that diesel is the only cars that produce particulate. Gasoline cars produce quite a lot of particulate too. It's just much finer, and so you can't see it. So now what's happening with regulations, and that's what 6c is all about here in Europe too, is about reducing the number of particulates in the atmosphere from both diesel and gasoline cars.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Peter Cartwright (Analysts)】\nSo they're both going to be banned then.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert MacLeod (Executives)】\nAny more? No? Well, then, thanks very much for coming indeed. And we'll see you again in 6 months' time.\r\nThank you.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you very much, and welcome to this change of financial guidance for 2014, '15. So we have lowered our organic revenue expectation from 8% to 9% down to 7%, which is from 13% to 14% in Danish kroner down to 12% in Danish kroner. And we have lowered our EBIT margin from 34% to 32%. That is both in constant exchange rates and in Danish kroner. And there are 2 reasons why we have lowered our growth guidance. One is U.K. and the other is U.S. And I'll just take you briefly through those. \r\nSo if we go back to Q1 in 2014, '15, the U.K. performance in our homecare business in the U.K., Charter, went from strong single-digit revenue growth to negative revenue growth as a result of our inadequate response to NHS regulatory change involving prescription handling. We said in that quarter that the needed changes in Charter would be implemented within 6 to 9 months and that growth rates within Charter would stay affected until the implementation has been finalized. In Q2, we basically reiterated that and we also saw an improved momentum in Charter, but performance was flat. And we said that within 3 to 6 months, we would need to implement -- we would have done the needed changes. Today, we can see that our expectations with regard to the pickup here in Q3 and 4 have been optimistic. And therefore, we think it takes to the end of the fiscal year to do all of the needed changes. Especially the time to train people in a new system, that takes time for us. \r\nWhat we can also see is that we are, on the other hand, having a very successful launch of Mio and we have a net positive inflow of patients into Charter. And we have not lost market share due to this development. So it is a temporary situation, but unfortunately, a little longer than what we thought in the beginning. For the U.S. then in the first quarter, we talked about our distributor buying patterns. And that actually came out as we expected. So we see a pickup in Q2 and expect to see pickup in Q3 also. But what is hurting us in the U.S. is our lack of ability to run external marketing campaigns due to the Department of Justice subpoena that was issued first to us but which is now in effect also with a number of our distribution partners. And therefore, there is some uncertainty on this. \r\nSo those are the 2 reasons. It's been the same reason since the beginning of the year, but it takes longer to get out of the issues than what we thought at the beginning of the year. So if you look then at the EBIT changes, then we have lowered our EBIT margin by 2 percentage points. Approximately half is coming from the lowered sales and the other half are for 3 issues. One is a provision for the DOJ situation, where we have taken an undisclosed provision for the cost associated with that. DOJ have finished their investigations, and we are in dialogue with them. And they have informed us about their conclusion. We are not in agreement with their conclusion. However, in the interest of the business, we have agreed to pursue a settlement route. And that's what we have provisioned for. We have also increased the provision for bad debt in Southern Europe, very much related to the situation in Greece. And finally, we have fully written down the stocks and so on, everything we had on the Negative Pressure Wound Therapy deal with Devon. So that's the other half of the lowering of the EBIT. \r\nSo that's basically where we are, and of course, not a situation that we are very happy with. And with that, I would like to hand you back to Q&A. And I forgot to say in the beginning that I'm joined by Anders Lonning-Skovgaard, who is the CFO of the company, and our Investor Relations team. So we are ready to take questions.",

So we are ready to take questions.",
      "transcript_text3": "So as a result of the DOJ assessment that you've flagged that want to take there, are there any behaviors that you're going to have to change in the long time -- in the long term? I mean, should we expect at least external marketing campaigns are never going to come back? And in the light of that, how do you feel confident that your longer-term revenue target is still valid? And then secondarily, can you break out the importance of the U.K. and the U.S. factors driving the revenue downgrade? I can see the data that say you're not losing market share in the U.K. Within your original guidance, were you expecting to increase market share in the U.K.? I mean, how should we think about that?\n\n---\n\nYes. Thank you for those questions. And it's -- I think the first question that you are asking is a question which we are all having on our minds. What does this DOJ investigation means for our ability to execute our direct-to-consumer strategy in the U.S.? As I said, the Department of Justice have finished their investigations. They have also played back to us what they have found. And it's our expectation that we will be able to fully run our direct-to-consumer strategies as they were planned to be run. That also includes that we will be able to implement the Care, also the next versions of Care exactly as we expected to do. So we feel that we are in a very comfortable situation in regards to our long-term strategy on a direct-to-consumer in the U.S. In the U.K. and our ability to run the business there, precisely what is it that you're looking for, Ian?\n\n---\n\nSorry, in terms of the guidance downgrade for the year, you helped us think about the -- where the EBIT downgrade is coming or the EBIT margin guidance downgrade for the revenue margin downgrade. I mean, is the U.K. just as important as the U.S. in terms of where your disappointment has come from? Or is one more important than the other?\n\n---\n\nThat's a very good question. It's -- I don't know if we are able to, at this point in time, split out exactly how that is. We have half of the downgrade on the EBIT comes from the revenue loss, so to say, or the missing revenue and the other half comes from the -- and that is from U.S. and U.K. And the other half comes from the 3 things that I mentioned: on Department of Justice, on Southern Europe and so on. So the half that comes from U.S. and U.K., that's the one that you like to have split out further. But I haven't prepared for that. But I would say that U.K. is, of course, important to us. And that's probably a bit more than half. But that's just back of the envelope.\n\n---\n\nI had 2. So first one, and I ask that you can give us as much detail as you can, but how closely aligned do you think the provision you're taking on DOJ will be with the ultimate settlement or release with the kind of conversations you're having now with the DOJ? And then I'll ask a second one as a follow-up.\n\n---\n\nI'm not sure I follow your question. Could you elaborate just a little bit?\n\n---\n\nWell, in other words -- yes, so you're taking a provision here and you're in discussions with DOJ. You've received what sounds like a final kind of ruling from them or at least final opinion from them. To what extent is that provision you're taking -- and you mentioned a settlement. Is that going to be close to what we would need to think about for the settlement you could potentially make? Or is it too early to say?\n\n---\n\nSince we haven't finished all of our negotiations, so to speak, it's -- I can't be final. This is our estimate. But it's an estimate based on what we know, and we know quite a bit at this point in time.\n\n---\n\nAnd is that driven by in terms of, a, amount of sales that you've had in the U.S., amount of profitability you've had in the U.S.? Can you give us some color on what factors are going into that provision?\n\n---\n\nNo. Since we have not finished that, we cannot give you more flavor on it. But if we didn't feel that we were within a range which we feel is certain, then we would not talk about it.\n\n---\n\nOkay, fair enough. And then the second question was just on Surgical Urology in the U.S. So that was weak last quarter. Is anything in the guidance downgrade related to Surgical Urology? And how has that looked in the U.S. in the quarter?\n\n---\n\nWell, I can't update you on the current quarter, apart from what we say on the U.S. and the U.K. So we'll come back to that when we finish the quarter. But everything that we learned, maybe I should just give you a few more insights on this, the reason why we are at this point in time coming with a change to guidance, every month, we have a monthly performance review, where we go through the performance of the different units and also their take on the future. And we had such a meeting yesterday. And it's basically based on the 2 things that I talked about here that we have changed our guidance. So it's -- those are the explanations.\n\n---\n\nOkay. So I guess, it's fair to say then that at this stage, what you know of Surgical Urology this far is actually already factored into what you're doing today. Okay, that's all for me.\n\n---\n\nI have just one question actually, please. You said you have not lost market share despite the factors that you mentioned in the U.K -- yes, I know. Have you won market share in a declining market, you think? Or do you think that -- and can you catch up with that trend? Maybe you can elaborate on that a little bit because it seems like you've mentioned it on the last call as well as it seems like it could become a chronic problem.\n\n---\n\nYes, that what could become a chronic problem?\n\n---\n\nThe situation in the U.K. with the homecare business, the one you...\n\n---\n\nWell, okay. Thank you very much. That's -- I think you are touching on a very important topic. That's -- what does this mean for the future of the U.K. Charter business? I think that we come out -- we will come out very strongly off this. But of course, we have lost customers in the homecare business, there's no doubt about that. We have probably primarily lost customers that are not using Coloplast products because we are serving everybody who's in the market, and we are having all competitors' products at the shelf also. But do I expect that we will start to grow from the new level that we have when we are fully through this? Of course, I do. But do I see that we are -- that things are progressing extremely well in the U.K. when it comes to Ostomy and the launch of new Mio? Yes, definitely. And we're also now launching a SpeediCath Compact Eve in the U.K. So I actually expect us to be very strong again in the U.K. when we are on the other side of this. The fact that we -- even though that we have so big problems as we have right now in the U.K., the fact that we are not losing market share in this situation just speaks to the strength of the business that we have and the strength of the product portfolio. So I take this as a low point from where we are actually progressing quite well.\n\n---\n\nAnd you don't think there will be pricing pressures following that trend? I mean, I'm just thinking of the homecare business. On the service side, Healthcare at Home, they have been quite successful and the NHS has put so much pressure, and then the EBIT margin has gone really down significantly. Is there a risk from the product side as well? From what you're doing is slightly different, I appreciate that. But still remains a trend that the NHS is putting quite a lot of pressure on prices at the moment.\n\n---\n\nI think that the pricing pressure that we see is not bigger at this point in time than at any other point in time over the last few years, where we also had the financial crisis. I can't see why this change or our current problems, which basically are unfortunately Coloplast problems, why they would trigger any further price pressure than what we see now. We'll live with the price pressure. We have done that for many years and they are here to stay, we know that. But I don't see that accelerating in the U.K.\n\n---\n\nFirstly, just on guidance. Lars, if I could follow up on the guidance. You're obviously maintaining your longer-term EBIT margin development guidance. Is that sort of 50 to 100 basis points a year from the -- as it where underlying margin guidance that you're giving full year '15 of what is roughly 33% or from the reported margin? That will be my first question.\n\n---\n\nYes, that's a very good question. And we will come back to that when we are guiding for the new year. It's not a question that we have been preparing for, for today.\n\n---\n\nOkay, fair enough. And just to follow up on Devon Medical, I don't know if you want to take the opportunity to talk about that just in terms of the -- what has been going on there and should we say, the Devon Medical response, which is in the market.\n\n---\n\nBut there's -- are you talking about the legal case or what...\n\n---\n\nYes, exactly. If you could just...\n\n---\n\nBut it's an ongoing case. It's important -- or it's impossible for me really to comment on it. We -- it's actually -- we're just in a situation here where we say, \"Let's take out of the books what we have because this is a legal situation.\" So that's why we do it. But I can't comment on the -- on the ongoing case. It's hardly started. It's very new actually.\n\n---\n\nI just have a couple of question follow-ups on the DOJ investigation. And I think the first one is why do you think the scrutiny or the level of marketing activities has decelerated so significantly in the last quarter or so? And then as a follow-up to that, appreciate that you feel that your activities won't be impacted, but have you had the same conversations with your dealers and distributors? And do you sense that once the -- do you sense actually from them that once the investigation disappears, they are happy to resume the activities as they used to with you?\n\n---\n\nIt's a little bit of a rippling effect because it started with Coloplast, and then you have seen that over time, it's been spreading to the distributors. So therefore, we are much further progressed in this matter than the other parties involved at this point in time. So therefore, we know about the business practices that we have had in the past. And of course, I can only vouch for what I know about Coloplast and the business practices that we have been conducting. And we see no reason why we should not be able to run direct campaigns going forward. But of course, we need to see that the dealers will go through with the same processes as we have been through.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And do you, Lars, have any views on when that process might conclude for them?\n\n---\n\nNo.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then if I were to look at your medium-term guidance of 7% to 10% top line growth and assume that you're unable to do any marketing activities via dealers and distributors and instead any activities that you undertake have to be direct on your behalf, do you venture a guess for what that guidance range would look like under that scenario?\n\n---\n\nNo. But that's a very good question. I think I'll park that for next time that we're giving guidance because that's probably relevant to speak about.\n\n---\n\nYes, 2 questions, again back to the U.S. market. I just want to dig a little bit a little bit more into it because as you say, you see some lost sales from lack of campaign activity. Do you know if this has actually hurt market growth for the products where you're affected? Or is it isolated, U.S. been hurt because, I guess, there's at least another of your competitors, which also is included in the...\n\n---\n\nNo, that's -- maybe if I take that first because that's a good question. What we said in the first quarter was that we could see that our assessment was impacted on -- we have a lot of assessment sales last year due to our direct campaign activities and it's been much harder for us to lift this year because we have not had the same kind of pressure on the markets. So I would actually expect that in the U.S. that we have -- we are probably impacting the growth of the assessment market. But I'm guessing, I don't have facts to underline this. But I'm just saying that we have significantly lower sales on assessments this year and we see significantly lower price in the market.\n\n---\n\nAnd then second question, just to be 100% sure. Does this have any kind of impact on your investments on the additional sales initiatives both for this year and for the coming years?\n\n---\n\nAs we said at the Capital Markets Day not long ago, then we have decided to keep the pressure on the investments because we fully acknowledge that top line growth is extremely important and we think that the long-term guidance we have is the right one. We think that is still valid. And therefore, we keep investing to deliver in that specific range that we have laid out, which is 7% to 10% top line growth and 50 to 100 basis point expansion on the bottom line every year.\n\n---\n\nBut the expansion that you had expected for U.K., I guess, that is not -- which I guess you had in some steps, I guess that is not folding out as you initially had expected?\n\n---\n\nFor this year?\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nI have to say that, well, this year is -- in that sense, this year is extremely difficult because when we did the guidance for this year, we had absolutely no idea about the issues that we -- that have unfolded in the U.K. So I consider that to be a one-off. And I think that we have dealt and are dealing with it in the most strongest way that we're able to do. And that's certainly not something that I expect to see every year. Mind you that this year, well, we're going to deliver 7% growth in a year where we see -- where we don't see at all the impact growth-wise that we would expect to see from both U.S. and U.K. They are our #1 and 2 biggest markets at all, and they're not performing like they should. So that talks a little bit to what the rest of the business is really doing.\n\n---\n\nOkay. I have, I think, 3 questions. The first question is relating to the external campaigns that you're able to run. When do you think you could initiate that for yourself? And to what extent do you actually require the collaboration of your distributors for that to have a meaningful impact on your business? And then the second question is on Greece. I think you've had -- you've been in this sort of situation before at the height of the financial crisis. But can you give us some color on how big of a, I suppose, challenge that your distributor is facing this time around relative to last time? And how much of a provision you actually had to use last time? And then the third question is on the, I suppose, the relative sizes -- or the NPWT writeoff, that seems to be -- you're in a pilot launch. So I was kind of surprised that you actually mentioned that as a factor, given that it should be quite immaterial as a factor.\n\n---\n\nYes, Anders will talk to Greece and the Negative Pressure Wound Therapy. So he will start out with that.\n\n---\n\nSo in terms of Greece, yes, in 2008, 2009, there was also some financial challenges in Greece. But we managed also in that period to handle our Greece business without any bad debt. This time, we also see some challenges due to the economic situation in Greece and we have decided to make a provision for bad debt in Greece. I'm not going to disclose any numbers. In relation to the second question around NPWT, can you just repeat that?\n\n---\n\nYes. So the -- I think part of the, I suppose, nonrevenue-driven downgrade to your margin you mentioned is due to writing down the NPWT inventory. My understanding is that you're in a pilot launch. And so I wasn't expecting there to be much inventory at all, so somewhat surprised that you actually mentioned it. Perhaps that is bigger than what I thought it would be. Could you comment on that?\n\n---\n\nSo the NPWT, as you might recall, we had a pilot in Brazil, in Switzerland and also in Greece. And then we, over the autumn and the winter, started to plan for a global launch. And that's why we have had a stock related to that. But due to the safety situation of the product, we decided to stop the cooperation with Devon.\n\n---\n\nOkay. So maybe it would be helpful to just comment, I suppose, prioritize the size of the 3 nonrevenue-related downgrades to your margin, which is the biggest and which is the smallest, will be helpful...\n\n---\n\nWe are not going to disclose any further on that at this point in time.\n\n---\n\nWhen it comes to the external campaigns or the campaigns that we're doing in the U.S., as it's quite clear right now, we are very limited in our abilities to do external campaigns. Actually, they have come to a complete full stop, which means that we are running internal campaigns, which we can do, of course. But it is with the way that we are running our business in the U.S. right now, it's more -- it has more traction when we do it in a collaboration with external partners. But of course, this means that we will have to look at how can we step up our abilities to do internal campaigns and to run more growth that way around. And that's just how it is. I can't give you a time frame on when the Department of Justice is fully done. And therefore, it's hard for me to comment on the timing of this.\n\n---\n\nOkay. So you won't be able to start any internal -- when you say internal, you mean just Coloplast-only campaigns?\n\n---\n\nThat is actually -- those are running as we speak.\n\n---\n\nOkay. So then it's only the external ones that the Department of Justice is limiting you on at this stage.\n\n---\n\nNo, they are not limiting us. What we are saying here is that because we -- I think that we have all been in doubt what is it that the Department of Justice is really looking for. Now we are -- we know what is the outcome for Coloplast because that is where we at this point in time. And we feel that we are ready now to go to do also external campaigns. But you need an external partner in order to do that. And the external partners are still under investigation. So they do not have the same clarity on the business practices as we have. And therefore, we don't do any external campaigns right now because the dealers, they have the same doubts as we had. So what is this really about?\n\n---\n\nOkay. And do you have any sense of how soon after the DOJ started speaking to you that they started to speak to the dealers, like how much of a lag that there has been?\n\n---\n\nWell, I can't guide you on that and I don't even know if -- because they have completely different scale of business than what we have many of them, so I wouldn't know what's the process and so on. So yes.\n\n---\n\nOkay. But the bottom line is you don't need to change much of what you've been planning.\n\n---\n\nNo.\n\n---\n\nSo just a timing thing that we could start to see these activities resume again.\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nThere's only one question left. Do you think that beneath the lower marketing activities in the U.S. were also a factor of more aggressive pricing of a competitor in [indiscernible], which had potentially a negative impact on guidance on U.S. market?\n\n---\n\nWhat? I don't think so. We also have Mio in the U.S. market now and we see -- we actually see that the interest is very high. We are winning several hospitals with this new assortment. So I don't see that. And yes. So no, I have to say no to that.\n\n---\n\nI'm quite encouraged to hear that you feel that you can continue with your direct-to-consumer initiatives in the North American market, obviously contingent on the master dealers also sort of concurring with your vision. What I'm interested to understand is do you see heightened compliance costs or an increased level of regulation? Can you discount the fact that you're entering into some Deferred Prosecution Agreement or some sort of Corporate Integrity Agreement of which might, if you like, limit or regulate some of the activities in North America? So that would be one question, please. And just a follow-up, do you think any of this activity limits the company's ability to secure GPO contracts in Ostomy or thence the strategy of value upgrading SpeediCath into the U.S. at the time of sort of patent expiry 2017?\n\n---\n\nI don't think that -- and I have to say that we are quite advanced in these negotiations. I don't see that we will have any extra burden of either cost or processes in order to conduct our business in the U.S. I think we fully understand where we are, and so over and -- I don't think that has anything over and above the constant pressure, which you always have on a business to make sure that when you run a global business that you are compliant with both local regulation and your own code of conduct. And that is issues that we are always working on to make sure that we are compliant. But apart from that, no, I don't think that this is going to have any impact.\n\n---\n\nAnd also you'd extend those comments through your potential to get on GPO contracts and your sort of value upgrade strategies of SpeediCath, you don't think that these things are connected at all or shouldn't be impacted by these developments?\n\n---\n\nI think it's a very good question. It's hard for me to say yes or no to this because I wouldn't expect it to. But it's not, of course, an area where I have a complete insight. But yes, I don't expect that, Scott. Okay, thank you very much for the interest. And this is the conclusion of the meeting.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Ian Douglas-Pennant (Analysts)】\nSo as a result of the DOJ assessment that you've flagged that want to take there, are there any behaviors that you're going to have to change in the long time -- in the long term? I mean, should we expect at least external marketing campaigns are never going to come back? And in the light of that, how do you feel confident that your longer-term revenue target is still valid? And then secondarily, can you break out the importance of the U.K. and the U.S. factors driving the revenue downgrade? I can see the data that say you're not losing market share in the U.K. Within your original guidance, were you expecting to increase market share in the U.K.? I mean, how should we think about that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lars Rasmussen (Executives)】\nYes. Thank you for those questions. And it's -- I think the first question that you are asking is a question which we are all having on our minds. What does this DOJ investigation means for our ability to execute our direct-to-consumer strategy in the U.S.? As I said, the Department of Justice have finished their investigations. They have also played back to us what they have found. And it's our expectation that we will be able to fully run our direct-to-consumer strategies as they were planned to be run. That also includes that we will be able to implement the Care, also the next versions of Care exactly as we expected to do. So we feel that we are in a very comfortable situation in regards to our long-term strategy on a direct-to-consumer in the U.S. In the U.K. and our ability to run the business there, precisely what is it that you're looking for, Ian?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ian Douglas-Pennant (Analysts)】\nSorry, in terms of the guidance downgrade for the year, you helped us think about the -- where the EBIT downgrade is coming or the EBIT margin guidance downgrade for the revenue margin downgrade. I mean, is the U.K. just as important as the U.S. in terms of where your disappointment has come from? Or is one more important than the other?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lars Rasmussen (Executives)】\nThat's a very good question. It's -- I don't know if we are able to, at this point in time, split out exactly how that is. We have half of the downgrade on the EBIT comes from the revenue loss, so to say, or the missing revenue and the other half comes from the -- and that is from U.S. and U.K. And the other half comes from the 3 things that I mentioned: on Department of Justice, on Southern Europe and so on. So the half that comes from U.S. and U.K., that's the one that you like to have split out further. But I haven't prepared for that. But I would say that U.K. is, of course, important to us. And that's probably a bit more than half. But that's just back of the envelope.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Alexander Kleban (Analysts)】\nI had 2. So first one, and I ask that you can give us as much detail as you can, but how closely aligned do you think the provision you're taking on DOJ will be with the ultimate settlement or release with the kind of conversations you're having now with the DOJ? And then I'll ask a second one as a follow-up.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lars Rasmussen (Executives)】\nI'm not sure I follow your question. Could you elaborate just a little bit?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Alexander Kleban (Analysts)】\nWell, in other words -- yes, so you're taking a provision here and you're in discussions with DOJ. You've received what sounds like a final kind of ruling from them or at least final opinion from them. To what extent is that provision you're taking -- and you mentioned a settlement. Is that going to be close to what we would need to think about for the settlement you could potentially make? Or is it too early to say?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lars Rasmussen (Executives)】\nSince we haven't finished all of our negotiations, so to speak, it's -- I can't be final. This is our estimate. But it's an estimate based on what we know, and we know quite a bit at this point in time.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Alexander Kleban (Analysts)】\nAnd is that driven by in terms of, a, amount of sales that you've had in the U.S., amount of profitability you've had in the U.S.? Can you give us some color on what factors are going into that provision?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lars Rasmussen (Executives)】\nNo. Since we have not finished that, we cannot give you more flavor on it. But if we didn't feel that we were within a range which we feel is certain, then we would not talk about it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Alexander Kleban (Analysts)】\nOkay, fair enough. And then the second question was just on Surgical Urology in the U.S. So that was weak last quarter. Is anything in the guidance downgrade related to Surgical Urology? And how has that looked in the U.S. in the quarter?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lars Rasmussen (Executives)】\nWell, I can't update you on the current quarter, apart from what we say on the U.S. and the U.K. So we'll come back to that when we finish the quarter. But everything that we learned, maybe I should just give you a few more insights on this, the reason why we are at this point in time coming with a change to guidance, every month, we have a monthly performance review, where we go through the performance of the different units and also their take on the future. And we had such a meeting yesterday. And it's basically based on the 2 things that I talked about here that we have changed our guidance. So it's -- those are the explanations.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Alexander Kleban (Analysts)】\nOkay. So I guess, it's fair to say then that at this stage, what you know of Surgical Urology this far is actually already factored into what you're doing today. Okay, that's all for me.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Martin Brunninger (Analysts)】\nI have just one question actually, please. You said you have not lost market share despite the factors that you mentioned in the U.K -- yes, I know. Have you won market share in a declining market, you think? Or do you think that -- and can you catch up with that trend? Maybe you can elaborate on that a little bit because it seems like you've mentioned it on the last call as well as it seems like it could become a chronic problem.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lars Rasmussen (Executives)】\nYes, that what could become a chronic problem?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Martin Brunninger (Analysts)】\nThe situation in the U.K. with the homecare business, the one you...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lars Rasmussen (Executives)】\nWell, okay. Thank you very much. That's -- I think you are touching on a very important topic. That's -- what does this mean for the future of the U.K. Charter business? I think that we come out -- we will come out very strongly off this. But of course, we have lost customers in the homecare business, there's no doubt about that. We have probably primarily lost customers that are not using Coloplast products because we are serving everybody who's in the market, and we are having all competitors' products at the shelf also. But do I expect that we will start to grow from the new level that we have when we are fully through this? Of course, I do. But do I see that we are -- that things are progressing extremely well in the U.K. when it comes to Ostomy and the launch of new Mio? Yes, definitely. And we're also now launching a SpeediCath Compact Eve in the U.K. So I actually expect us to be very strong again in the U.K. when we are on the other side of this. The fact that we -- even though that we have so big problems as we have right now in the U.K., the fact that we are not losing market share in this situation just speaks to the strength of the business that we have and the strength of the product portfolio. So I take this as a low point from where we are actually progressing quite well.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Martin Brunninger (Analysts)】\nAnd you don't think there will be pricing pressures following that trend? I mean, I'm just thinking of the homecare business. On the service side, Healthcare at Home, they have been quite successful and the NHS has put so much pressure, and then the EBIT margin has gone really down significantly. Is there a risk from the product side as well? From what you're doing is slightly different, I appreciate that. But still remains a trend that the NHS is putting quite a lot of pressure on prices at the moment.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lars Rasmussen (Executives)】\nI think that the pricing pressure that we see is not bigger at this point in time than at any other point in time over the last few years, where we also had the financial crisis. I can't see why this change or our current problems, which basically are unfortunately Coloplast problems, why they would trigger any further price pressure than what we see now. We'll live with the price pressure. We have done that for many years and they are here to stay, we know that. But I don't see that accelerating in the U.K.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Edward Ridley-Day (Analysts)】\nFirstly, just on guidance. Lars, if I could follow up on the guidance. You're obviously maintaining your longer-term EBIT margin development guidance. Is that sort of 50 to 100 basis points a year from the -- as it where underlying margin guidance that you're giving full year '15 of what is roughly 33% or from the reported margin? That will be my first question.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lars Rasmussen (Executives)】\nYes, that's a very good question. And we will come back to that when we are guiding for the new year. It's not a question that we have been preparing for, for today.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Edward Ridley-Day (Analysts)】\nOkay, fair enough. And just to follow up on Devon Medical, I don't know if you want to take the opportunity to talk about that just in terms of the -- what has been going on there and should we say, the Devon Medical response, which is in the market.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lars Rasmussen (Executives)】\nBut there's -- are you talking about the legal case or what...\n\n---\n\n【質問: Edward Ridley-Day (Analysts)】\nYes, exactly. If you could just...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lars Rasmussen (Executives)】\nBut it's an ongoing case. It's important -- or it's impossible for me really to comment on it. We -- it's actually -- we're just in a situation here where we say, \"Let's take out of the books what we have because this is a legal situation.\" So that's why we do it. But I can't comment on the -- on the ongoing case. It's hardly started. It's very new actually.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Veronika Dubajova (Analysts)】\nI just have a couple of question follow-ups on the DOJ investigation. And I think the first one is why do you think the scrutiny or the level of marketing activities has decelerated so significantly in the last quarter or so? And then as a follow-up to that, appreciate that you feel that your activities won't be impacted, but have you had the same conversations with your dealers and distributors? And do you sense that once the -- do you sense actually from them that once the investigation disappears, they are happy to resume the activities as they used to with you?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lars Rasmussen (Executives)】\nIt's a little bit of a rippling effect because it started with Coloplast, and then you have seen that over time, it's been spreading to the distributors. So therefore, we are much further progressed in this matter than the other parties involved at this point in time. So therefore, we know about the business practices that we have had in the past. And of course, I can only vouch for what I know about Coloplast and the business practices that we have been conducting. And we see no reason why we should not be able to run direct campaigns going forward. But of course, we need to see that the dealers will go through with the same processes as we have been through.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Veronika Dubajova (Analysts)】\nOkay. And do you, Lars, have any views on when that process might conclude for them?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lars Rasmussen (Executives)】\nNo.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Veronika Dubajova (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then if I were to look at your medium-term guidance of 7% to 10% top line growth and assume that you're unable to do any marketing activities via dealers and distributors and instead any activities that you undertake have to be direct on your behalf, do you venture a guess for what that guidance range would look like under that scenario?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lars Rasmussen (Executives)】\nNo. But that's a very good question. I think I'll park that for next time that we're giving guidance because that's probably relevant to speak about.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Martin Parkhoi (Analysts)】\nYes, 2 questions, again back to the U.S. market. I just want to dig a little bit a little bit more into it because as you say, you see some lost sales from lack of campaign activity. Do you know if this has actually hurt market growth for the products where you're affected? Or is it isolated, U.S. been hurt because, I guess, there's at least another of your competitors, which also is included in the...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lars Rasmussen (Executives)】\nNo, that's -- maybe if I take that first because that's a good question. What we said in the first quarter was that we could see that our assessment was impacted on -- we have a lot of assessment sales last year due to our direct campaign activities and it's been much harder for us to lift this year because we have not had the same kind of pressure on the markets. So I would actually expect that in the U.S. that we have -- we are probably impacting the growth of the assessment market. But I'm guessing, I don't have facts to underline this. But I'm just saying that we have significantly lower sales on assessments this year and we see significantly lower price in the market.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Martin Parkhoi (Analysts)】\nAnd then second question, just to be 100% sure. Does this have any kind of impact on your investments on the additional sales initiatives both for this year and for the coming years?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lars Rasmussen (Executives)】\nAs we said at the Capital Markets Day not long ago, then we have decided to keep the pressure on the investments because we fully acknowledge that top line growth is extremely important and we think that the long-term guidance we have is the right one. We think that is still valid. And therefore, we keep investing to deliver in that specific range that we have laid out, which is 7% to 10% top line growth and 50 to 100 basis point expansion on the bottom line every year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Martin Parkhoi (Analysts)】\nBut the expansion that you had expected for U.K., I guess, that is not -- which I guess you had in some steps, I guess that is not folding out as you initially had expected?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lars Rasmussen (Executives)】\nFor this year?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Martin Parkhoi (Analysts)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lars Rasmussen (Executives)】\nI have to say that, well, this year is -- in that sense, this year is extremely difficult because when we did the guidance for this year, we had absolutely no idea about the issues that we -- that have unfolded in the U.K. So I consider that to be a one-off. And I think that we have dealt and are dealing with it in the most strongest way that we're able to do. And that's certainly not something that I expect to see every year. Mind you that this year, well, we're going to deliver 7% growth in a year where we see -- where we don't see at all the impact growth-wise that we would expect to see from both U.S. and U.K. They are our #1 and 2 biggest markets at all, and they're not performing like they should. So that talks a little bit to what the rest of the business is really doing.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Yi-Dan Wang (Analysts)】\nOkay. I have, I think, 3 questions. The first question is relating to the external campaigns that you're able to run. When do you think you could initiate that for yourself? And to what extent do you actually require the collaboration of your distributors for that to have a meaningful impact on your business? And then the second question is on Greece. I think you've had -- you've been in this sort of situation before at the height of the financial crisis. But can you give us some color on how big of a, I suppose, challenge that your distributor is facing this time around relative to last time? And how much of a provision you actually had to use last time? And then the third question is on the, I suppose, the relative sizes -- or the NPWT writeoff, that seems to be -- you're in a pilot launch. So I was kind of surprised that you actually mentioned that as a factor, given that it should be quite immaterial as a factor.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lars Rasmussen (Executives)】\nYes, Anders will talk to Greece and the Negative Pressure Wound Therapy. So he will start out with that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Anders Lonning-Skovgaard (Executives)】\nSo in terms of Greece, yes, in 2008, 2009, there was also some financial challenges in Greece. But we managed also in that period to handle our Greece business without any bad debt. This time, we also see some challenges due to the economic situation in Greece and we have decided to make a provision for bad debt in Greece. I'm not going to disclose any numbers. In relation to the second question around NPWT, can you just repeat that?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Yi-Dan Wang (Analysts)】\nYes. So the -- I think part of the, I suppose, nonrevenue-driven downgrade to your margin you mentioned is due to writing down the NPWT inventory. My understanding is that you're in a pilot launch. And so I wasn't expecting there to be much inventory at all, so somewhat surprised that you actually mentioned it. Perhaps that is bigger than what I thought it would be. Could you comment on that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Anders Lonning-Skovgaard (Executives)】\nSo the NPWT, as you might recall, we had a pilot in Brazil, in Switzerland and also in Greece.

But it is with the way that we are running our business in the U.S. right now, it's more -- it has more traction when we do it in a collaboration with external partners. But of course, this means that we will have to look at how can we step up our abilities to do internal campaigns and to run more growth that way around. And that's just how it is. I can't give you a time frame on when the Department of Justice is fully done. And therefore, it's hard for me to comment on the timing of this.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Yi-Dan Wang (Analysts)】\nOkay. So you won't be able to start any internal -- when you say internal, you mean just Coloplast-only campaigns?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lars Rasmussen (Executives)】\nThat is actually -- those are running as we speak.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Yi-Dan Wang (Analysts)】\nOkay.

And do you have any sense of how soon after the DOJ started speaking to you that they started to speak to the dealers, like how much of a lag that there has been?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lars Rasmussen (Executives)】\nWell, I can't guide you on that and I don't even know if -- because they have completely different scale of business than what we have many of them, so I wouldn't know what's the process and so on. So yes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Yi-Dan Wang (Analysts)】\nOkay. But the bottom line is you don't need to change much of what you've been planning.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lars Rasmussen (Executives)】\nNo.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Soren Hansen (Analysts)】\nSo just a timing thing that we could start to see these activities resume again.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lars Rasmussen (Executives)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Oliver Metzger (Analysts)】\nThere's only one question left. Do you think that beneath the lower marketing activities in the U.S. were also a factor of more aggressive pricing of a competitor in [indiscernible], which had potentially a negative impact on guidance on U.S. market?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lars Rasmussen (Executives)】\nWhat? I don't think so. We also have Mio in the U.S. market now and we see -- we actually see that the interest is very high. We are winning several hospitals with this new assortment. So I don't see that. And yes. So no, I have to say no to that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Bardo (Analysts)】\nI'm quite encouraged to hear that you feel that you can continue with your direct-to-consumer initiatives in the North American market, obviously contingent on the master dealers also sort of concurring with your vision. What I'm interested to understand is do you see heightened compliance costs or an increased level of regulation? Can you discount the fact that you're entering into some Deferred Prosecution Agreement or some sort of Corporate Integrity Agreement of which might, if you like, limit or regulate some of the activities in North America? So that would be one question, please. And just a follow-up, do you think any of this activity limits the company's ability to secure GPO contracts in Ostomy or thence the strategy of value upgrading SpeediCath into the U.S. at the time of sort of patent expiry 2017?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lars Rasmussen (Executives)】\nI don't think that -- and I have to say that we are quite advanced in these negotiations. I don't see that we will have any extra burden of either cost or processes in order to conduct our business in the U.S. I think we fully understand where we are, and so over and -- I don't think that has anything over and above the constant pressure, which you always have on a business to make sure that when you run a global business that you are compliant with both local regulation and your own code of conduct. And that is issues that we are always working on to make sure that we are compliant. But apart from that, no, I don't think that this is going to have any impact.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Bardo (Analysts)】\nAnd also you'd extend those comments through your potential to get on GPO contracts and your sort of value upgrade strategies of SpeediCath, you don't think that these things are connected at all or shouldn't be impacted by these developments?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lars Rasmussen (Executives)】\nI think it's a very good question. It's hard for me to say yes or no to this because I wouldn't expect it to. But it's not, of course, an area where I have a complete insight. But yes, I don't expect that, Scott. Okay, thank you very much for the interest. And this is the conclusion of the meeting.",

      "transcript_text1": "Good morning to all the participants in this webcast conference call regarding Inditex results for the interim 3 months 2015. I am Pablo Isla. Here with me today are Ignacio Fernández, our CFO; and Marcos López, Capital Markets Director. \r\nThe results for the interim 3 months 2015 show that Inditex continues its global multi-concept, multi-channel growth. We enjoy a global sales platform that fully integrates the stores and online and offers huge growth opportunities. \r\nInditex operating performance in the period has been strong. Sales have increased 17%. Our operations have also shown high efficiency and tight operating control over the period. As a result, EBIT has grown 25%. \r\nLet me also tell you that in terms of expansion, space growth and online launches for the year are on track. In terms of growth, we have maintained the strong pace of expansion. We have opened stores in 27 different markets over the period, demonstrating the global reach of Inditex business model. We have continued our global online rollout. We have a global presence and have further diversified our operations over the period. We continue to see significant growth opportunities for Inditex globally. \r\nThe year so far has been marked by very strong activity on many fronts. I would like to cover a number of recent initiatives carried out by Inditex. We have reinforced significantly the differentiation of our key global flagships with very visible openings. \r\nStarting with Zara, I would like to highlight those stores opened recently: first, this remarkable store at 61 Oxford Street in London; second, the enlargement of the store at Xidan Joy City in Beijing, a unique location and one of our most emblematic stores worldwide. Bershka is rolling out its new image. This is reflected in its flagship store in Torino. Massimo Dutti is offering a personal tailoring service at its recently refurbished global flagship at la Madeleine, Paris, that reopened at the end of May. Pull&Bear has recently launched a global flagship store in Shanghai's East Nanjing Road. Stradivarius has opened a flagship store of 1,200 square meters at Madero in Mexico. Oysho has moved to a new headquarters and distribution center in Tordera. The new building comprises 50,000 square meters. Oysho has also launched a new store image. This is reflected in its flagship in Paseo de Gracia at Barcelona. Zara Home has recently enlarged its global flagship store in Milan's Piazza San Babila to 2,700 square meters, making it the largest Zara Home store worldwide. Zara Home also continues its global online rollout with its recent launch in Japan. And Uterqüe has opened a store with its new image in Madrid Airport. \r\nInditex is in a unique situation as we enjoy a global sales platform that fully integrates stores and online as the best way to respond to the demands of our customers. This is a result of our highly differentiated business model, with a central inventory position, distribution to all our stores globally at least twice a week and orders received by our customers between 2 and 48 hours. This factor works perfectly in conjunction with our global online sales presence. We believe that Inditex is in an excellent position to take advantage of global growth opportunities. We have a strong potential to continue expanding profitably in the coming years. \r\nLet me now hand over to Ignacio, who will present some of the key aspects of our financial performance, and I will join you later for the outlook section.\n\n---\n\nThank you. In the first quarter of 2015, Inditex has had a strong operating performance. All the key lines of the profit and loss account show significant growth. Net sales reached EUR 4.4 billion; EBITDA, EUR 895 million; and net income, EUR 521 million. \r\nIn the first quarter 2015, sales have grown 17%. Like-for-like sales growth has been strong, and store and online launches for the year are on track. Sales growth in local currencies was 13%. Set currencies remain at current levels. We estimate 2% at least on sales for fiscal year 2015.\r\nGross profit has increased 18% to EUR 2.6 billion, resulting a 59.4% gross margin on sales. We have sustained our commercial policies over the period. \r\nOperating expenses are tightly under control. They have grown 15%, reflecting mainly the growth in space and sales. They include all the startup costs for new openings. \r\nOperating working capital remains negative as a result of the business model. The working capital evolution is in line with the performance of the business. \r\nI will now hand over to Marcos, who'll elaborate on the performance of the Inditex concepts.\n\n---\n\nIn terms of space addition and online launches, we are on track. Continuing with our global expansion, we have opened stores in 27 markets in the first quarter of the year. Global online launches continue at a very rapid pace. \r\nRegarding the performance by concept in the interim 3 months 2015, Zara continues to represent approximately 2/3 of group sales; the younger concepts, around 1/3. The younger concepts, grouped together, have performed satisfactorily. I would like to highlight that Stradivarius, Zara Home and Uterqüe have performed very strongly. \r\nI will now hand over to Pablo for the outlook section.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Marcos. With respect to expansion in 2015, let me highlight that space growth and online launches are on track. Ordinary capital expenditure for 2015 will be around EUR 1.35 billion. For the coming years, we'll continue to see strong growth opportunities, with capital expenditure growing below space growth. \r\nRegarding the outlook for the first half of 2015, I would like to add that store and online sales in local currencies from the 1st of February to the 7th of June have grown by 13.5%. \r\nJust as a reminder, we made our initial 2014 dividend payment of EUR 809 million on the 4th of May. We will continue to invest in the expansion of our business across a number of markets, all of which offer attractive long-term returns through our sales platform that fully integrates stores and online. \r\nInditex is present on 5 continents and in all the key markets, demonstrating the group's global reach. We manage a diversified sales platform in 88 markets, and the current base offers huge growth potential for the coming years.\r\nInditex online operations have seen a very rapid growth in recent years. Our business model allows a swift expansion of our online sales globally. Zara has built an online sales presence in 21 European markets, the United States, China, the Russian Federation, Japan, South Korea, Mexico and Canada, the world's main economies. The concepts also have an established online sales presence in Europe. Additionally, some of the concepts are present in the United States. We will continue to roll out online sales progressively in all the markets in which we are present with the stores. A step in this direction will be the launch of Zara online sales in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau in the autumn/winter season. \r\nBefore closing, I would like to highlight some selected Zara store openings from recent months. I would like to begin with the flagship store that Zara has opened recently in Amsterdam. The new Zara flagship at Toison d’Or in Brussels has very strong architectural features. Zara has recently enlarged its Hamburg flagship store to 4,000 square meters. The store at Copenhagen has also been enlarged to 4,000 square meters. The Zara store in Vladivostock is housed in the GUM historical building. We have enlarged and introduced the new image at our store in Tokyo's iconic Ikebukuro district. We have opened a flagship store in Em Quartier in Bangkok. Finally, our newest store in Urumqui has been extremely well received. This is store #510 in China.  \r\nAnd this is all from us. We will be pleased to answer any question you may have.",

      "transcript_text3": "My question is about Zara Home, and I'm wondering if you can explain why it continues to outperform. I know it had 2 very strong years already, and it looks like it's outperforming in Q1 as well. And then talk about where you're rolling that out because you mentioned the global rollout. So are you focusing on any particular countries there?\n\n---\n\nWell, thank you. What we can tell you is that we are very pleased with the performance of Zara Home. And we are doing 2 different things. In one hand, we are enlarging the existing stores. We have mentioned during the presentation the example of Piazza San Babila, which is the, I would say, the most relevant global flagship of Zara Home. And at the same time, we are opening stores in very relevant locations, such as Aoyama in Tokyo or Bourke Street in Melbourne. Well, we also are developing or rolling out the online presence of Zara Home in key markets globally. We also have mentioned that we have recently launched the online sales in Japan. What we can say is that Zara Home is a very good brand, which is being very well accepted and received in all the different markets. And what we are thinking to do is to continue developing the brand.\n\n---\n\nOkay. So any particular markets where you've been expanding faster with Zara Home?\n\n---\n\nNo, I would say we are opening our stores globally. We are building a strong presence in Europe, we are opening in the relevant Asian markets, and we have also presence in the Americas, so we'll continue with the -- I would say -- I wouldn't mention any specific geography. We think it's a brand with very strong potential. As I was saying to you, it's very well received in all the different markets.\n\n---\n\nCould you just talk a little bit more about the LFL performance in the quarter in terms of which markets were stronger or less strong and also where you put prices up and how relevant that price increases were to the LFL performance in the quarter?\n\n---\n\nThank you. What we can say is that like-for-like sales growth, we have had very strong operating performance and with positive like-for-like sales growth in all the different geographies. You know that we don't like to elaborate very much on this or that country at -- particularly in a quarter because we prefer always to wait until the full year or at least until the end of the season. But what we can say is that we have had a strong like-for-like performance in the different markets in this first quarter. And this like-for-like sales growth is volume driven, so our pricing policy globally has been to maintain stable prices in the different markets. That is the global pricing policy. There could be one exception here or there in one sense or the other, but globally, as we always say, our prices have remained stable in the different markets. If -- in fact, if you analyze our average selling price over the years, you see that it is very, very stable. Particularly if you think about the last year, the year 2014, it was around EUR 17.5, our average selling price, and it has been the same in the last 10 or 15 years, so a stable pricing policy in the different markets.\n\n---\n\nBut presumably, in markets where FX has been particularly weak, like Russia or Japan, you have had to adjust for that, have you?\n\n---\n\nBut you must have in mind that we operate a global business. We are present in 88 different markets. We have lots of markets, so I think it's not particularly relevant to mention this or that specific country. What I can tell you is a stable pricing policy as the global policy of the company.\n\n---\n\nI've got a couple of questions for you, please. Firstly, do you think that you're seeing a benefit of the weaker euro, such as translating through improved tourism into Euroland revenues? And secondly, can you talk about Spain and your views ahead of the sort of second half on the general elections?\n\n---\n\nWell, what I would say is that, well, you know that we always prefer not to enter into macroeconomic questions or this type of things. What we can say is that we are happy with the evolution of our business in the different European markets. What we can say about the external environment is that we could say that it's a reasonable environment for us to continue developing our business and to continue growing in the different markets. In particular, about the Spanish market, you were mentioning, well, we said in the full year results presentation that in the year 2014, we achieved 5% sales growth in Spain, which was a very, I would say, well, strong or consistent sales growth. And what we can tell you is that in this year, we continue with this positive evolution in the Spanish market.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then just in terms of your full year tax charge, please, do you have any guidance given? I think it was 23.7% in the first quarter.\n\n---\n\nYes. You know that our tax -- quarterly tax charge is always the best estimate for the year, so this is the guidance we can provide.\n\n---\n\nJust a quick one on your space rollout. Obviously, if you look at your number of stores, they grew by about 5.5% year-on-year; and Zara, about 5%. You've talked on the call about enlarging a number of stores, but I just wanted to be clear. Your longer-term store rollout -- space rollouts or store rollouts targets, the 8% to 10%, you still feel that, that's certainly achievable for, say, the medium term? And would that be more going into new countries? Or do you think it's more about deepening the stores across the concepts in existing geographies? And which ones would those be?\n\n---\n\nYes. Well, first of all, what I would say is that, as you were mentioning, for us, what is relevant is space growth much more than the number of openings because space growth is a combination between opening new stores; as you know, we are also absorbing small stores; and then also enlarging existing stores. So in terms of our space growth, as we said in the full year result presentation in March, we'll continue seeing this 8% to 10% space growth. We operate in 88 different markets with 8 different brands, so this means that we are finding very good space growth opportunities. And the second part of your question, it's always a combination of both between the possibility of new countries and then deepening our presence in the markets in which we are already present. You must have in mind that in most of the markets in which we are already present, our market share is below 1%, so this is going to be the main engine of future space growth. Of course, there could also always be new markets, but we have -- as we were saying during the presentation, we continue seeing a strong growth opportunities in the different markets. In any particular year, we are opening stores. Last year, I think it was in 54 different countries; in this first quarter, in 27 different countries. So this year, you could expect us opening stores in 50 or in 60 different markets over the year. So that is why we continue seeing this space growth rate. It has a lot to do with this global presence.\n\n---\n\nOkay, that's helpful. Just a quick -- just last one, on the dividend, obviously, your cash balances remain robust. When you look forward, even though you've got the negative working capital, any comments sort of over the next 12 to 24 months on the dividend policy, either in terms of the payout ratio or potential for other returns of cash to shareholders?\n\n---\n\nYes, what -- you know that we like to -- we always update about the dividend policy in the full year results presentation, and of course, we are generating significant cash flows. Our first priority is always to invest in the long-term profitable growth of the company, but because of this strong cash flow generation, we are able to combine this with what we consider an attractive and predictable shareholders remuneration policy. We have this stated policy of 50% payout and then the possibility of extraordinary dividends. And regarding 2014 results, what the Board of Directors decided was to propose to the shareholders' meeting a 7% increase in the dividend. This was, if I am right, 63% payout ratio. Well, what we can say is that we have more than doubled the dividend in the last 5 years, and our idea is to continue with this same policy, with this type of approach. But in any case, the moment in which we like always to talk about the dividend is the full year results presentation.\n\n---\n\nI just wanted to ask a question on the gross margin. It was obviously up 50 basis points year-over-year in the first quarter. Sales momentum clearly seems like it's been strong going into Q2, which I guess would suggest that you should continue to do well on markdown. But on the other hand, clearly, FX is essentially [ph] negative if you can't offset with pricing and other initiatives. Do you maintain the view that stability is the best expectation for -- or the central expectation for the year?\n\n---\n\nYes. As you know, and as we always say, the gross margin is a combination of many different things: fashion trends, say, product mix, like for likes, markups, markdowns, currencies, the comparable, so -- and at the same time, you know that our business model is very flexible, and then it provides stability to the gross margins. This is why in the full year results presentation, we were talking about a stable gross margin for the year. We always say that stable for us means plus/minus 50 basis points. What we can say is that at current exchange rates, our best estimate is for a broadly stable gross margin for 2015. It is true that this year, probably a bit higher in the first half and a bit lower in the second half given the evolution of the U.S. dollar-euro exchange rate. But globally, a stable gross margin for the year.\n\n---\n\nAnd also, in light of the guidance around CapEx growing slower than space growth in the years ahead, just wondered if you could give a bit more color to understand how much slower it would grow, whether you actually can -- would expect it to grow in absolute terms, and whether we're talking about a couple of percent variance or quite substantial leverage of that investment you put into prior years.\n\n---\n\nYes. It's difficult to be very specific about any particular figure of difference between space growth and CapEx growth. What we would -- what we can tell you is what you already know, that after this period in which we have invested strongly in logistics, in IT, with some extraordinary CapEx from that point of view, what we see this year and the coming years is CapEx growth to be below space growth. Then in [ph] any particular year, that would always be 1 point, 2 points, so it's very difficult to be more precise, but you should expect, in any case, CapEx growth below space growth in the coming years.\n\n---\n\nWould you be prepared to say how much of your CapEx bill every year is on square meter expansion?\n\n---\n\nIt would -- 80%, 85%. Well, expansion and refurbishments, I would say, around 85% of the CapEx in a normal year. And then there are some years, as it has been in the past few years, in which logistics represent a more relevant part of that CapEx.\n\n---\n\nI got a question on import tariffs. It seems quite significant changes recently I noticed, particularly in China over the last 10 days or so. Could you say what your position is there? Will you see a benefit in terms of your gross margin in China and -- or whether you will pass that benefit through in the form of lower retail prices?\n\n---\n\nYes. Thank you, Andy. Regarding what you comment, the change in tariffs regards very specific product categories, so the impact in our gross margin is very, very small. And to give you some color, I think the only category in which there is some kind of impact is [indiscernible] in the categories in which we operate, it doesn't affect us.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Are there any other changes in any other markets in terms of import tariffs that we should be aware of?\n\n---\n\nNot significant.\n\n---\n\nJust one question from me, please, on productivity initiatives. I wondered if you could just give an update, in particular, on the radio frequency technology in stores. It sounds like that's giving some productivity benefits for Zara. And so I wonder if you can say how much of that technology now are being rolled out across the Zara estate and also for the other formats, please.\n\n---\n\nWell, what we can tell you is that RFID is helping a lot in the way we operate the stores. It has to do with everything related with the store operations. Of course, the main target for us implementing RFID has to do with customer service. But then it's helping a lot in terms of the way we receive the product in the store, the way we replenish from the stockroom to the floor, the inventories, so it is helping a lot from every point of view. I think it's a very positive change in terms of the way we operate and we manage the stores. We continue with the rollout in Zara. At the end of this year, we will be present in around 1,500 Zara stores in the world, and then we will begin the rollout in the -- with the other brands. It's something which is -- we think it's a very positive change in the way we operate the stores from every point of view. I don't know, but probably you have had the opportunity to see how it works in Guangzhou, in one particular store, and it has really changed completely the way we control the stock. But mainly, the main target behind RFID is customer service. So now we can offer our customers a much better service from the point of view of the service we offer them; also, from the point of view that we can check immediately if it's available or not, then we offer them the possibility to order online from the stores if this is the case. So RFID combined with online, this full integration between stores and online, is something which is, we think, a big and positive change in the way we manage our stores.\n\n---\n\nOkay. So it sounds like there is some -- the Zara estate, it will be mostly rolled out by the end of this year, and then there will be a little bit more to do next year. Is that right for Zara?\n\n---\n\nYes. Yes, yes, that's right.\n\n---\n\nAnd then the net -- the other formats will be rolled out next year mainly?\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nGood morning. So we've had a number of questions via the webcast platform, principally surrounding the known [ph] Zara concepts. The first of which is, at Zara Home, we see strong growth in store numbers and also in terms of larger store sizes. Are you also expanding in the Southern Hemisphere? What is changing your assessment of this concept in order to enter into these sorts of initiatives?\n\n---\n\nWell, I think this question has been raised during the conference call, so I wouldn't say what -- I would repeat what I was saying before, that we are very pleased with the performance of Zara Home, and we are developing the brand in the different geographies, both through relevant store openings and through online. Zara Home is a brand which is very, very well accepted in all the different geographies in which we are introducing the brand and developing. And in the presentation, we were mentioning this relevant enlargement of the most important flagship today of Zara Home in the world and, at the same time, this online launch in Japan. In Japan, we also have stores with Zara Home, as you know, relevant stores in Tokyo and Osaka, in the different Japanese cities. So we'll continue developing the brand in the different markets.\n\n---\n\nAlso, Pablo, perhaps you could expand on your thoughts on Oysho. We have another question on Oysho. Oysho seems to be back on track, and you have invested significantly in enlarging headquarters and the distribution center. Do you feel more confident about the prospects of this concept now?\n\n---\n\nWell, we have always feel -- felt confident with the prospects of Oysho. About the new headquarters, what Oysho is doing is to -- Oysho has moved to what used to be the Massimo Dutti headquarters in Barcelona, in Tordera. We built a new logistics platform and headquarters for Massimo Dutti, and then we have refurbished the former Massimo Dutti headquarters. And Oysho, because of its growth, has moved to what used to be the Massimo Dutti headquarters and also the Massimo Dutti logistic platform that now is the former one, that now is the Oysho logistic platform. We think we have very good product, very good store image. We are developing also new lines, very strong, the Gymwear Collection. Well, in the presentation, we have mentioned this new flagship in Paseo de Gracia in Barcelona, which is a very relevant one and which is showing the full range of products that we have now with Oysho. So our idea is to continue developing the brand in the coming years.\n\n---\n\nThat's the final question from webcast. We have no more questions here.\n\n---\n\nWell, then thank you again to all of you. And in any case, of course, as always, we are ready to answer any questions you may have through our Capital Markets Department. Thank you very much for joining us during this conference call. Thank you.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Anne Critchlow (Analysts)】\nMy question is about Zara Home, and I'm wondering if you can explain why it continues to outperform. I know it had 2 very strong years already, and it looks like it's outperforming in Q1 as well. And then talk about where you're rolling that out because you mentioned the global rollout. So are you focusing on any particular countries there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nWell, thank you. What we can tell you is that we are very pleased with the performance of Zara Home. And we are doing 2 different things. In one hand, we are enlarging the existing stores. We have mentioned during the presentation the example of Piazza San Babila, which is the, I would say, the most relevant global flagship of Zara Home. And at the same time, we are opening stores in very relevant locations, such as Aoyama in Tokyo or Bourke Street in Melbourne. Well, we also are developing or rolling out the online presence of Zara Home in key markets globally. We also have mentioned that we have recently launched the online sales in Japan. What we can say is that Zara Home is a very good brand, which is being very well accepted and received in all the different markets. And what we are thinking to do is to continue developing the brand.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Anne Critchlow (Analysts)】\nOkay. So any particular markets where you've been expanding faster with Zara Home?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nNo, I would say we are opening our stores globally. We are building a strong presence in Europe, we are opening in the relevant Asian markets, and we have also presence in the Americas, so we'll continue with the -- I would say -- I wouldn't mention any specific geography. We think it's a brand with very strong potential. As I was saying to you, it's very well received in all the different markets.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Simon Irwin (Analysts)】\nCould you just talk a little bit more about the LFL performance in the quarter in terms of which markets were stronger or less strong and also where you put prices up and how relevant that price increases were to the LFL performance in the quarter?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nThank you. What we can say is that like-for-like sales growth, we have had very strong operating performance and with positive like-for-like sales growth in all the different geographies. You know that we don't like to elaborate very much on this or that country at -- particularly in a quarter because we prefer always to wait until the full year or at least until the end of the season. But what we can say is that we have had a strong like-for-like performance in the different markets in this first quarter. And this like-for-like sales growth is volume driven, so our pricing policy globally has been to maintain stable prices in the different markets. That is the global pricing policy. There could be one exception here or there in one sense or the other, but globally, as we always say, our prices have remained stable in the different markets. If -- in fact, if you analyze our average selling price over the years, you see that it is very, very stable. Particularly if you think about the last year, the year 2014, it was around EUR 17.5, our average selling price, and it has been the same in the last 10 or 15 years, so a stable pricing policy in the different markets.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Simon Irwin (Analysts)】\nBut presumably, in markets where FX has been particularly weak, like Russia or Japan, you have had to adjust for that, have you?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nBut you must have in mind that we operate a global business. We are present in 88 different markets. We have lots of markets, so I think it's not particularly relevant to mention this or that specific country. What I can tell you is a stable pricing policy as the global policy of the company.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rebecca McClellan (Analysts)】\nI've got a couple of questions for you, please. Firstly, do you think that you're seeing a benefit of the weaker euro, such as translating through improved tourism into Euroland revenues? And secondly, can you talk about Spain and your views ahead of the sort of second half on the general elections?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nWell, what I would say is that, well, you know that we always prefer not to enter into macroeconomic questions or this type of things. What we can say is that we are happy with the evolution of our business in the different European markets. What we can say about the external environment is that we could say that it's a reasonable environment for us to continue developing our business and to continue growing in the different markets. In particular, about the Spanish market, you were mentioning, well, we said in the full year results presentation that in the year 2014, we achieved 5% sales growth in Spain, which was a very, I would say, well, strong or consistent sales growth. And what we can tell you is that in this year, we continue with this positive evolution in the Spanish market.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rebecca McClellan (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then just in terms of your full year tax charge, please, do you have any guidance given? I think it was 23.7% in the first quarter.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ignacio Izuzquiza Fernández (Executives)】\nYes. You know that our tax -- quarterly tax charge is always the best estimate for the year, so this is the guidance we can provide.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Steegers (Analysts)】\nJust a quick one on your space rollout. Obviously, if you look at your number of stores, they grew by about 5.5% year-on-year; and Zara, about 5%. You've talked on the call about enlarging a number of stores, but I just wanted to be clear. Your longer-term store rollout -- space rollouts or store rollouts targets, the 8% to 10%, you still feel that, that's certainly achievable for, say, the medium term? And would that be more going into new countries? Or do you think it's more about deepening the stores across the concepts in existing geographies? And which ones would those be?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nYes. Well, first of all, what I would say is that, as you were mentioning, for us, what is relevant is space growth much more than the number of openings because space growth is a combination between opening new stores; as you know, we are also absorbing small stores; and then also enlarging existing stores. So in terms of our space growth, as we said in the full year result presentation in March, we'll continue seeing this 8% to 10% space growth. We operate in 88 different markets with 8 different brands, so this means that we are finding very good space growth opportunities. And the second part of your question, it's always a combination of both between the possibility of new countries and then deepening our presence in the markets in which we are already present. You must have in mind that in most of the markets in which we are already present, our market share is below 1%, so this is going to be the main engine of future space growth. Of course, there could also always be new markets, but we have -- as we were saying during the presentation, we continue seeing a strong growth opportunities in the different markets. In any particular year, we are opening stores. Last year, I think it was in 54 different countries; in this first quarter, in 27 different countries. So this year, you could expect us opening stores in 50 or in 60 different markets over the year. So that is why we continue seeing this space growth rate. It has a lot to do with this global presence.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Steegers (Analysts)】\nOkay, that's helpful. Just a quick -- just last one, on the dividend, obviously, your cash balances remain robust. When you look forward, even though you've got the negative working capital, any comments sort of over the next 12 to 24 months on the dividend policy, either in terms of the payout ratio or potential for other returns of cash to shareholders?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nYes, what -- you know that we like to -- we always update about the dividend policy in the full year results presentation, and of course, we are generating significant cash flows. Our first priority is always to invest in the long-term profitable growth of the company, but because of this strong cash flow generation, we are able to combine this with what we consider an attractive and predictable shareholders remuneration policy. We have this stated policy of 50% payout and then the possibility of extraordinary dividends. And regarding 2014 results, what the Board of Directors decided was to propose to the shareholders' meeting a 7% increase in the dividend. This was, if I am right, 63% payout ratio. Well, what we can say is that we have more than doubled the dividend in the last 5 years, and our idea is to continue with this same policy, with this type of approach. But in any case, the moment in which we like always to talk about the dividend is the full year results presentation.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charlie Muir-Sands (Analysts)】\nI just wanted to ask a question on the gross margin. It was obviously up 50 basis points year-over-year in the first quarter. Sales momentum clearly seems like it's been strong going into Q2, which I guess would suggest that you should continue to do well on markdown. But on the other hand, clearly, FX is essentially [ph] negative if you can't offset with pricing and other initiatives. Do you maintain the view that stability is the best expectation for -- or the central expectation for the year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nYes. As you know, and as we always say, the gross margin is a combination of many different things: fashion trends, say, product mix, like for likes, markups, markdowns, currencies, the comparable, so -- and at the same time, you know that our business model is very flexible, and then it provides stability to the gross margins. This is why in the full year results presentation, we were talking about a stable gross margin for the year. We always say that stable for us means plus/minus 50 basis points. What we can say is that at current exchange rates, our best estimate is for a broadly stable gross margin for 2015. It is true that this year, probably a bit higher in the first half and a bit lower in the second half given the evolution of the U.S. dollar-euro exchange rate. But globally, a stable gross margin for the year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charlie Muir-Sands (Analysts)】\nAnd also, in light of the guidance around CapEx growing slower than space growth in the years ahead, just wondered if you could give a bit more color to understand how much slower it would grow, whether you actually can -- would expect it to grow in absolute terms, and whether we're talking about a couple of percent variance or quite substantial leverage of that investment you put into prior years.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nYes. It's difficult to be very specific about any particular figure of difference between space growth and CapEx growth. What we would -- what we can tell you is what you already know, that after this period in which we have invested strongly in logistics, in IT, with some extraordinary CapEx from that point of view, what we see this year and the coming years is CapEx growth to be below space growth. Then in [ph] any particular year, that would always be 1 point, 2 points, so it's very difficult to be more precise, but you should expect, in any case, CapEx growth below space growth in the coming years.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charlie Muir-Sands (Analysts)】\nWould you be prepared to say how much of your CapEx bill every year is on square meter expansion?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nIt would -- 80%, 85%. Well, expansion and refurbishments, I would say, around 85% of the CapEx in a normal year. And then there are some years, as it has been in the past few years, in which logistics represent a more relevant part of that CapEx.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Hughes (Analysts)】\nI got a question on import tariffs.

Will you see a benefit in terms of your gross margin in China and -- or whether you will pass that benefit through in the form of lower retail prices?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ignacio Izuzquiza Fernández (Executives)】\nYes. Thank you, Andy. Regarding what you comment, the change in tariffs regards very specific product categories, so the impact in our gross margin is very, very small. And to give you some color, I think the only category in which there is some kind of impact is [indiscernible] in the categories in which we operate, it doesn't affect us.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Hughes (Analysts)】\nOkay.
