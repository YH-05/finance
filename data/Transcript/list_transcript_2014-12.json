      "transcript_text1": "Morning, everyone. Welcome to the annual results analysts' presentation for the year to 30th of September 2014. We'll run through the usual routine. I'll do a few slides, just giving some general remarks, and then hand over to the Bill Rattray, who can go into the figures in more detail.\r\n2014 was obviously a good year for us, I think, in a number of ways: increased scale and diversification from SWIP. Cost synergies from SWIP are ahead of expectations, and the incremental margin is already 50% for the second half. And I can -- and Bill will cover later, it's -- the exit multiple, to use that -- the exit operating margin, if I can use that term, is already at 55%; big year in terms of profit, GBP 490 million; earnings per share, down 4%, but if we hadn't done the SWIP transaction, they would have been down a further 6% at negative 10%. So SWIP was 6% earnings per share positive in the second half; full year dividend of 18p, up 13%. So we've had 10 years of uninterrupted dividend growth and, over the last 5 years, 25% compounded dividend growth; and then net cash at the year-end of over GBP 650 million; and of course, AuM at GBP 325 billion. And I'll show you the flows in a minute, but new business flows, more balanced in the final quarter, and in fact, in the higher-margin equity business, a very sharp improvement, as you'll see.\r\nWhen you look at this slide, you see the rationale, obviously, for doing the SWIP transaction; Aberdeen, 56%; equities over 80% of our revenues coming from 3 high-margin products and 3 subscale businesses. The merger with SWIP, obviously, as you can see, brings the enlarged group equities down to 33%, but more importantly, in revenues, still at round about the 60% mark coming from equities and the bulk of that still coming from the 3 big products that we have at Aberdeen.\r\nI would -- I thought I'd show you here just -- or we'd show you here just some of the gross new flows so you can see them in isolation. And we split it here, as you can see, on the top graph between equities, fixed income, Aberdeen Solutions and property. And then on the bottom, the bottom graph, we've split it up, the gross new business flows between the legacy Aberdeen business and the SWIP business. So you can see what net new business SWIP is generating.\r\nBut I think this is probably the more interesting slide because I think it tells the story of the year better than any figures, I think. What it does show is these massive outflows we had in our emerging market business and our Asian business and our global business in those first 2 quarters, and then we had a big institutional outflow in the third quarter. So as I say, it does show, in stark reality, those massive flows that we had out of the high-margin businesses in the first half of the year, which affected revenue hugely. And then we've seen the sharp improvement in the fourth quarter of the flows within equities, so a big recovery, as I say, in the fourth quarter.\r\nIt might be as well just to cover very briefly, before I hand over to Bill, the rationale behind the SWIP transaction. The first one was, obviously, to strengthen the capabilities, as I've already said, fixed income, solutions and properties. And we've -- as you can see here, in the progress, we've restructured the front offices of those 3 divisions. \r\nThe long-term strategic relationship with Lloyds, we're making good progress there and we're seeing very good flows into the property fund. In fact, we're trying to slow flows into the property fund at the moment just because we can't get the money into the market.\r\nAnd then finally, as always, trying to create value for our shareholders, we've already covered the operating margin of 55%. We've achieved that earlier than we expected, and we expect further synergies in the back office. And then, of course, one of the rationale was financial, additional cash generation to reinforce the progressive dividend policy we have.\r\nSo just concluding on my slides before I hand over to Bill. Here, you can see the increase over the last 10 years of earnings per share of less than 5p, 5p earnings per share, up unto this year, where the dividend is 18p per share, so very strong growth in the dividend and earnings per share and, of course, cash generation during that event. I think this slide also portrays one of the things we've said, which is the dividend is not tied to a fixed payout rate. We would expect to see it grow even if, as you see here, earnings per share are marginally down at 4%.\r\nI won't say any more, but hand over to Bill Rattray. I'll even turn the page for you there, Bill, so that you can get off to a flying start.\n\n---\n\nGood morning, everyone. Even better than that, you've covered most of the points on the first slide.\r\nSo let me pick on one of the ones you haven't covered is the operating margin. Well, maybe I wasn't listening. 43.9% this year, that's down 1.5% on the last year. Virtually, all of that is down to the lower performance fee income, which, I think, is probably not a great surprise to you. The rest, really, all nets out: the benefit of SWIP, as Martin mentioned, offsetting the reduced profitability from the impact of the equity outflows.\r\nAnd just doing a reconciliation of how the profit has moved over the year. You can see in the first orange bar the net effect of the earlier part of the year is that management fees from the original Aberdeen business were down by about GBP 48 million. SWIP, of course, coming in from the second half, has boosted that by close to GBP 120 million. And performance fees, you can see in the middle there, close to GBP 30 million, down on last year's record figure. But on the cost side, I mean, those are -- the benefit within the existing Aberdeen business, we were able to trim some costs to react to the lower revenues. On the other side, SWIP coming in has brought in new costs of GBP 60 million. I'll cover that in a little bit more detail in the -- in one of the later slides.\r\nAnd you're probably fairly familiar by now with this slide. We break the revenues, profits and margin down into discrete half year periods. And you'll see and recall that the first half of this year saw the first real downturn in the margin for some while, but you can see it's bounced back pretty strongly with the benefit of SWIP coming in, in the second half.\r\nLooking at the numbers in a little bit more detail. We've talked about the operating margin, but the costs out of the equation, the compensation ratio is 34.8% for the year. It's a little bit up on last year, but if you look at the historic trend, it's been pretty consistently round about 35% for the few years before that. And I think we did reflect this time last year that probably 33% was a little bit unsustainable. Going forward, I mean, I think the guidance is pretty much what you've heard us say before, somewhere around about 35%, 36%. That sort of order feels like a realistic number. \r\nIn terms of the other costs, you've seen already that we added GBP 60 million in the second half from SWIP. So when you're modeling forward, clearly, you want to add something in for the full year effect of that, but again, just same message as last year. We don't really see any material uptick in the non-staff costs, so just some sort of allowance for indexation.\r\nThen looking at slightly more detail at the SWIP contribution. As Martin's already mentioned, the operating margin from that discrete business in the second half is fractionally short of 50%. And the key to that, as you'll recall, is the cost synergies we expected to achieve from eliminating some duplicate overhead from the business. \r\nNow as you'll recall, that is something that was happening during the period. So what you're seeing is the actual return for the 6 months. As Martin's already mentioned, if we take a snapshot, the picture, as we exit at the end of September, that margin's already up to 55%. And you'll recall that that's the target we set in the announcement document to get there by September 2015 once the back office is fully integrated. So you can see we're broadly about a year ahead of the game. There's still a little bit more can come out over the next few months, but also, we still have this additional benefit at the end of 2015 when the back office is fully integrated. So you can, I guess, extrapolate that sort of number, and you'll probably come to a figure round about 60% rather than the 55% we guided on.\r\nAnd just briefly on the revenue side. I mean, a slight change in mix now with SWIP having come in. Performance fees were always a relatively small part of our overall revenues, historically no more than 5% of total revenues. The SWIP business brings very little in the way of performance fee income. So a combination of that and the fact that performance fees were down anyway means that we're now 2% coming from performance fees and, more importantly, 98% from recurring sources. And that's the sort of pattern we'd expect going forward.\r\nThe blended fee rate's actually a fairly difficult one to try and explain to you in simple but meaningful terms this time. What I'm going to focus on is the final 2 columns, and you'll recall that the pro forma blend of the Aberdeen and the SWIP business that we mentioned at completion, we expected an overall blended fee rate of round about 36.5 basis points. The actual for the second half of this year is at 36.9, and the comforting thing is that -- is both the Aberdeen and the SWIP elements of the business are slightly ahead of expectations. I think the theme going forwards, you've heard us say it before, is really to be taking new business on at better than the bank books. So the theme is -- very much is to try and get that blended fee rate rising again.\r\nOn cash flow, a pretty strong performance, pretty full conversion\r\n[Audio Gap]\r\njust over 110% conversion. We've had the usual few ins and outs in terms of seed capital and other investments\r\n[Audio Gap]\r\njust about GBP 460 million. The way the SWIP transaction was structured, it brought in some cash in the opening balance sheet, some of which we've used to offset the one-off expenses we've incurred so far, but the rest of it was there really to offset the additional regulatory capital requirement. So overall, free cash flow this year was GBP 500 million. We've used GBP 200 million of that to pay last year's final and this year's interim dividends in cash terms and used GBP 65 million to buy the shares required to ensure EBT remains fully vested for deferred shares, so very, very strong increase in cash, GBP 238 million.\r\nAnd then moving on to regulatory capital. If I start at the bottom line here, you'll recall that when we spoke just after the half year results, the accounting impact of SWIP had knocked a little bit of a dent in the surplus that we had over the regulatory requirement. We've rebuilt that. I mean, the board has been fairly clear they would like to see a buffer of some headroom of around about GBP 100 million over the regulatory requirement, and you can see we've rebuilt that at just around GBP 115 million over.\r\nSo a slight change in presentation this time around. You will notice that at the top half of the table, we've deducted the pension surplus that we have in the balance sheet this time around. Previously, we had just included that within the capital requirements, so there's a slight turnaround. But you can see the actual regulatory capital we have at GBP 465 million is comfortably ahead of the GBP 350 million requirement. \r\nAnd just to rationalize that GBP 465 million in terms of the cash that Martin's mentioned in the balance sheet, the key thing is when we look at regulatory numbers, we have to make a deduction for the final dividend we propose. So in very round terms, the GBP 650 million of cash, GBP 150 million -- or just short of GBP 150 million for the final dividend, so in round figures, GBP 500 million and a few other minor assets and liabilities in the balance sheet. That is broadly the picture on the GBP 465 million.\r\nSo in summary, as Martin mentioned at the start, I mean, really, SWIP -- it's been a strange year. It's been a year of 2 halves, as the saying goes. SWIP has clearly transformed the business, progressing in line with our expected timing, but we're already ahead of the game on cost synergies; strong cash generation and we expect that to continue; and again, as Martin's mentioned, the aim is to keep the dividend rising steadily.\r\nSo with that, I'll sit down and open it to questions.",

      "transcript_text3": "Thanks, Bill. Any questions? Bruce? One at the front here.\n\n---\n\nYes. Bruce Hamilton, Morgan Stanley. Firstly, given the SWIP deal has obviously gone very well, and you're well progressed on integration. How do you think now about sort of possible further M&A? It seems like there's quite a few potential assets out there. I mean, is there any gaps that you think would be kind of interesting? And then secondly, sorry, a more numbers one, just understanding the SWIP revenue margins in equities and fixed income, it looks like equities went up a lot in the second half and fixed income slightly down. That'd be helpful.\n\n---\n\nI'll let you do the second question. I think we've said it's going to be a further 18 months, the SWIP integration. So really it does take any substantive M&A off the table. I mean, if something came up that was an add-on of a capability we don't have, we'd certainly have a look at it, but certainly nothing substantial. We're committed to generating cash for our shareholders, Bruce. I like the way the people laugh actually.\n\n---\n\nYes. On the SWIP fee margins, I mean, the equity is one of -- there's actually pretty strange reasons. One of the mandates we lost was pretty low margin. You recall that was a very small book of business anyway. So it really is just that impact. The fixed income one, I suspect is really just a mix effect in we are -- we have been just sort of settling down some of the analysis of what we report actually is fixed income as opposed to what is part of solutions. I suspect it was just an evening out of some of those numbers.\n\n---\n\nIt's Arnaud Giblat from UBS. Three questions, please. First, could you perhaps give us a bit more color on the October, November flows, specifically around your equity funds? Also, maybe what consultants might be saying there in terms of performance? Secondly, are you thinking about maybe reopening those funds, taking away the upfront loans? And finally, capital returns. Now that you're in excess of your GBP 100 million target headroom, I'm sure you'll be expecting some capital returns in the longer term.\n\n---\n\nBill, do you want to cover the first?\n\n---\n\nRight, I'll cover. October, November, looking pretty similar to what you saw for the September quarter; equities, pretty flat. I mean, the 3 main equity classes. GEM is reasonably flat, maybe fractionally negative; Asia Pacific and global equities, both slightly positive; and of course, the wider asset classes mild outflows, but as I say, nothing really different to the September quarter.\n\n---\n\nI think on equity performance, what the consultants are saying is we've seen the recovery from our 2013 underperformance. And if you have a look at page -- I can just barely see the number here, 38, you can see the year-to-date numbers are the key numbers as far as we're concerned and they're broadly in line or outperforming really. The one we're not is probably global equities, where we've been underweight, America, but again, that's sort of explainable. I think the consultants are more worried about to come out -- and this partly answers your question. They're more worried about capacity than they are about performance because we've done what we said we would do on performance really. So I think what it does mean is we can't reopen the global equity funds anytime -- sorry, the Global Emerging Market Funds anytime soon, but we are seeing interest from institutional shareholders. So we can balance really redemptions into taking on new institutional business, but I don't see us reopening the -- or taking the front-end fund or load off the GEM funds.\n\n---\n\nYes. Capital returns?\n\n---\n\nOh, capital. Sorry, I almost forgot that. Yes, I mean, I think we've got excess. What we do need, and Bill can maybe cover this, is we do need to have -- what is the word for this, well, they're not audited figures, but they're...\n\n---\n\nYes. We can only recognize additional increases in that headroom on a half yearly basis when -- either on audited results or from the half year figures are really -- are viewed and published. So the next time we actually show you something in excess of that GBP 100 million headroom, is -- it's going to be the March numbers.\n\n---\n\nSo March is when we would expect to see -- and we are committed to buying back equity at that point, once we generate additional cash. If the cash generation's good in this half, there is no reason why we should not see repurchase of shares in the future, plus, of course, good dividend growth as well. Let's not forget the dividend growth. Peter?\n\n---\n\nIt's Peter Lenardos from RBC. A couple of quick questions. First of all, I noticed in fiscal '14, you actually sold shares out of your treasury. You had more bought back at the half period than you did at the period end. Just curious why you'd be selling those shares back when you plan to retire shares in the future. And the other question I have is the weakening of the GBP is obviously good for your business. Against what key currency should we measure that?\n\n---\n\nProbably the dollar?\n\n---\n\nYes, the main one's the U.S. dollar. To a slightly lesser extent but maybe somewhat linked, would be Singapore dollar. I guess, the third one worth mentioning is the euro, which is probably more important within some of the property business.\n\n---\n\nAnd on the shares?\n\n---\n\nOn the shares, I mean, yes, you're right, we ended up -- the EBT ended up with surplus shares at the end of the half year. And we decided because it's a drag on regulatory capital, it was the wrong thing to do to continue to hold that surplus long term. So we turned the position the second half.\n\n---\n\nYes. I'd see us retire -- canceling shares rather than holding them in the EBT in the future. So they were in the wrong structure basically. There's one there.\n\n---\n\nArun Melmane, Canaccord. I had a question on the strategic relationship you had with -- or you still have with Lloyds. Where has that gone? Is it still driving some flows? When do you expect that to sort of fire on all engines would be a question.\n\n---\n\nI think the first thing to say is they're very committed to -- at the top level within Lloyds, to making this relationship work at that strategic level. And we're still in the process of working with them on what sort of products will -- would be suitable for more general distribution, shall we say, rather than the wealth area or the private banking area of the bank. And that's where, I think, the -- this capability we have in Quantec with these is going to be really useful because I think the products that banks are now going to look for have got to have low-tracking errors and low cost. So it will be designed around those areas, but they are very committed to this relationship, as you know. And I've given you the statistic before. They have 25% of the current account market in the U.K. and a 2% share of the wealth market, and they really do want to grow that. But as you know, we've got to be very careful what gets sold into any sort of banking market. And you probably saw the announcement at the weekend. They've removed the incentive arrangements for all their branch networks going from the 1st of January. So again, I think that helps. I think it means that they're not going to be pushing products but actually genuinely selling what is suitable for investors in the future.\n\n---\n\nCould we see that later [indiscernible]\n\n---\n\nYes, I think so. I mean, I think, as we've said, we place very little store by building the relationship on that side. I think the senior management at Lloyds, as I say, are very committed to it, and as far as we're concerned, as you know, it's a deferred arrangement position. So if we do have to pay, we'll have done pretty well as a result of it. It looks like -- oh, one more -- sorry.\n\n---\n\nSorry, Tom Mills, Crédit Suisse. I just wondered, could you say where -- which products you're seeing client interest in going into 2015?\n\n---\n\nYes. I think more of the same probably. We are seeing institutional interest in emerging market equities. We're seeing quite a lot of interest in the SWIP property fund. The issue there is getting -- as I've said, getting the money into the market, so we're really having to be quite disciplined on not taking or not pushing the -- pushing that product or pushing that fund too far. We're still seeing quite a lot of interest in the emerging market debt products. I would say that's it. I mean, what we're trying to do is really try and broaden the business away from this huge overreliance we had on these 3 blockbuster products that we're lucky enough to have. So those are the areas we're trying to push, as well as the solutions businesses, trying to get more money into the fund of funds businesses. Yes?\n\n---\n\nDavid McCann from Numis. A couple of questions. Firstly, just on the tax rate, it looks like it was 15% in the second half. Previously, I think you talked about kind of 17%, 18% as kind of guidance. So maybe just update where the guidance is now for that going forward?\n\n---\n\nYes. I think we probably do guide 17% being probably a reasonably prudent sort of estimate. I mean, I think 18% is maybe a little bit on the top side. What we've seen, I mean, I would start from the full year figure and work back. 16% for the full year effective rate probably indicates we maybe slightly overestimated at the half year. But even year-on-year, it's fractionally down on the last year. Main reason for that is really the reduction in the U.K. corporation tax rate. I mean, for the U.K. profits in 2013, the effective rate was 23.5%. This year, it's 22%. There was also a minor benefit from the fact that our U.S. business has now turned profitable, and the fact that we've got tax losses forward from previous years means we have no charge on that element.\n\n---\n\nOkay, because it sounds like the 16% might a bit more sensible.\n\n---\n\n16% or maybe fractionally above 16% is sustainable.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And the other question I just had on the numbers was of the GBP 60 million SWIP costs for the second half of last year. Could you split that between compensation and non-compensation?\n\n---\n\nOff the top of my head, I can't. We can come back to you on that one.\n\n---\n\nPeter?\n\n---\n\nWhat about just one last question on amortization going forward? What's your guidance there? I know it was GBP 120 million, including SWIP on a full run rate basis. Is that still the case?\n\n---\n\nYes. Again, on the fairly high level, it'd be pretty similar, somewhere between GBP 100 million and GBP 120 million per annum for the next -- certainly, for the next year. I think beyond that, we'd -- you begin to see some of our earlier acquisitions begin to drift off.\n\n---\n\nWe try and keep it as high as possible just so that we don't get some sort of issue in the years ahead. There's one more of there.\n\n---\n\nIt's Richard Perrott from Autonomous. Can I just ask on fixed income flows, where it seems like performance is, let's say, picked up a lot over the last year or so, but is still an outflow, say, in many products outside EM debt? And I was wondering what the reasons for that were. Is it a lag? Or was it just in terms of investor preference via fund type?\n\n---\n\nYes. I think the bulk of it, you'll find is the cash funds. So we're seeing -- and in these sort of markets, we're seeing a steady drift out of cash funds. You tend to see that: when equities are going up, cash funds go down; when equities go down, cash funds go up. So it's really that, plus 1 or 2, perhaps, legacy issues. But generally, fixed income is going a lot better with, as you quite rightly say, the good 1-, 3- and 5-year numbers, we're starting to see quite good inflows into that. And then the merger with the SWIP team, I think it's really -- it's a pretty powerful fixed income business now. I think revenues, from memory, Bill can correct me if I'm wrong, have gone from something like about GBP 110 million to about GBP 190 million, GBP 195 million for the fixed income business. So it's a pretty good scale now compared to what it was.\n\n---\n\nYes, Marcus Barnard from KBW. On Slide 9, where you showed the movement in your profit before tax, you saw a reduction in your asset management fees of about GBP 48 million in the last year from Aberdeen. Is that an exceptionally large figure or is that the sort of figure we should sort of see going forward?\n\n---\n\nWell, I think that's really going back to the early part of the year. The impact of the heavy outflows we saw from equities, particularly the global emerging market equities. From memory, I think the markets were maybe a little bit soft at that stage as well. So it really is principally down to that. I guess, in a normal year, you'd expect us to want to increase that rather than decrease.\n\n---\n\nYes, that was a particularly bad year for us. We hope we don't have another year of losing GBP 48 million of fee revenue. Great -- one more question, all right, sorry.\n\n---\n\nYour answer might be no, but I just wondered if you could give some guidance on what you're seeing in Q1 flows.\n\n---\n\nI think just as we've said. I mean, more of the same from the quarter, the September quarter, so probably, what, marginal outflows, but especially in equities, I mean, really, sort of pretty neutral, I would say. So far, that's October, November. So yes, we're not unduly concerned about it. It's not like -- I have to say, it's not like last year, which was November, December, January, February was relentless. And those were the really, really big outflow months. \r\nGreat, well, look, if there are no more questions, we'll wrap up, and obviously, Bill will be here to answer any further questions you might have. Thanks very much for attending. Thank you.",
      "transcript_text4": "【回答: Martin Gilbert (Executives)】\nThanks, Bill. Any questions? Bruce? One at the front here.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Bruce Hamilton (Analysts)】\nYes. Bruce Hamilton, Morgan Stanley. Firstly, given the SWIP deal has obviously gone very well, and you're well progressed on integration. How do you think now about sort of possible further M&A? It seems like there's quite a few potential assets out there. I mean, is there any gaps that you think would be kind of interesting? And then secondly, sorry, a more numbers one, just understanding the SWIP revenue margins in equities and fixed income, it looks like equities went up a lot in the second half and fixed income slightly down. That'd be helpful.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Gilbert (Executives)】\nI'll let you do the second question. I think we've said it's going to be a further 18 months, the SWIP integration. So really it does take any substantive M&A off the table. I mean, if something came up that was an add-on of a capability we don't have, we'd certainly have a look at it, but certainly nothing substantial. We're committed to generating cash for our shareholders, Bruce. I like the way the people laugh actually.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rattray (Executives)】\nYes. On the SWIP fee margins, I mean, the equity is one of -- there's actually pretty strange reasons. One of the mandates we lost was pretty low margin. You recall that was a very small book of business anyway. So it really is just that impact. The fixed income one, I suspect is really just a mix effect in we are -- we have been just sort of settling down some of the analysis of what we report actually is fixed income as opposed to what is part of solutions. I suspect it was just an evening out of some of those numbers.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Arnaud Giblat (Analysts)】\nIt's Arnaud Giblat from UBS. Three questions, please. First, could you perhaps give us a bit more color on the October, November flows, specifically around your equity funds? Also, maybe what consultants might be saying there in terms of performance? Secondly, are you thinking about maybe reopening those funds, taking away the upfront loans? And finally, capital returns. Now that you're in excess of your GBP 100 million target headroom, I'm sure you'll be expecting some capital returns in the longer term.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Gilbert (Executives)】\nBill, do you want to cover the first?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rattray (Executives)】\nRight, I'll cover. October, November, looking pretty similar to what you saw for the September quarter; equities, pretty flat. I mean, the 3 main equity classes. GEM is reasonably flat, maybe fractionally negative; Asia Pacific and global equities, both slightly positive; and of course, the wider asset classes mild outflows, but as I say, nothing really different to the September quarter.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Gilbert (Executives)】\nI think on equity performance, what the consultants are saying is we've seen the recovery from our 2013 underperformance. And if you have a look at page -- I can just barely see the number here, 38, you can see the year-to-date numbers are the key numbers as far as we're concerned and they're broadly in line or outperforming really. The one we're not is probably global equities, where we've been underweight, America, but again, that's sort of explainable. I think the consultants are more worried about to come out -- and this partly answers your question. They're more worried about capacity than they are about performance because we've done what we said we would do on performance really. So I think what it does mean is we can't reopen the global equity funds anytime -- sorry, the Global Emerging Market Funds anytime soon, but we are seeing interest from institutional shareholders. So we can balance really redemptions into taking on new institutional business, but I don't see us reopening the -- or taking the front-end fund or load off the GEM funds.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Arnaud Giblat (Analysts)】\nYes. Capital returns?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Gilbert (Executives)】\nOh, capital. Sorry, I almost forgot that. Yes, I mean, I think we've got excess. What we do need, and Bill can maybe cover this, is we do need to have -- what is the word for this, well, they're not audited figures, but they're...\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rattray (Executives)】\nYes.

With me here today are Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Tom Szlosek; and Vice President of Investor Relations, Elena Doom. This call and webcast, including any non-GAAP reconciliations, are available on our website at www.honeywell.com/investor. \r\nNote that elements of this presentation contain forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the world and of our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can change, and we'd ask that you interpret them in that light. \r\nWe identify the principal risks and uncertainties that affect our performance in our Form 10-K and other SEC filings.\r\nThis morning, we will review our financial expectations for the remainder of 2014 and discuss our 2015 planning, building on the framework we gave you back in October, and of course, we'll allow time for your questions. \r\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Tom Szlosek.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin on Slide 3 by confirming the fourth quarter is on track with about 2 weeks left in the year. We are exiting 2014 with strong momentum, evidenced by a continuation of positive short-cycle order rate trends and a robust backlog in our long-cycle businesses. We are reaffirming our full year 2014 pro forma EPS guidance of $5.50 to $5.55 a share, up 11% to 12% versus 2013. We continue to expect organic sales growth of approximately 3% for both the fourth quarter and the full year. \r\nAs I'm sure you've seen by now in our press release, we sold the remaining 1.9 million of BEAV shares in the fourth quarter and are deploying the gain to fund certain Aerospace OEM incentives. I'll walk through all the details in a moment, but wanted to reiterate that the transactions have no impact on our fourth quarter net income, EPS or free cash flow guidance and position Aero well for future growth with the biggest impacts on 2016 and 2017. \r\nLooking ahead, 2015 is poised to be another terrific year for Honeywell. We have and will continue to invest in R&D and sales and marketing resources globally. This focus on innovation has enabled big wins in the marketplace. There are many examples that we have shared with you throughout the year, and they pervade our entire portfolio. Our penetration in the high-growth regions is relentless, and we continue to drive CapEx investments in high ROI projects, particularly in PMT. \r\nWhile expecting to achieve double-digit free cash flow growth, we are also investing in CapEx at a rate approximately 1.5x to 2x depreciation, a trend we expect to continue into 2015. We've also been able to proactively fund restructuring projects, and we're expecting over $140 million for the full year of 2014, which allows us to drive sustainable productivity action. \r\nThe Honeywell enablers continue to result in growth and operational excellence across the company. Key initiatives like Velocity Product Development, Organizational Effectiveness and Functional Transformation are resulting in significant benefits across the portfolio, and we are broadening our approach to HOS Gold. You'll remember that our focus for HOS was first on the supply chain and then to our product development process. That initiative has paid off well, and we are now applying HOS Gold across all business processes in our 70 HOS Gold enterprises, which will enable and sustain exceptional growth and productivity improvements. We are excited to share more about this at our March Investor Day. \r\nToday, we'll provide an update on the markets we serve and a bottom-up portfolio view that supports our 2015 outlook. Our plans reflect a modest growth environment. So we have once again been conservative on cost assumptions. We've also incorporated the impacts from the stronger U.S. dollar. For example, you will see that we have planned the euro at $1.20. We feel confident that with our balanced portfolio mix, alignment to favorable macro trends, focused growth initiatives and cost discipline, we'll continue to outperform. \r\nI'm now on Slide 4, which presents a brief recap of the BEAV share gains and deployment actions, which will yield benefits in 2015 and beyond, principally in 2016 and 2017. You will recall that we've divested the Consumables businesses --  the Consumables Solutions business to B/E Aerospace in 2008. At the time, we received cash proceeds of $900 million plus 6 million shares of BEAV common stock with a fair value at the time of roughly $150 million. We sold 2.6 million shares in the fourth quarter of 2013 and 1.5 million shares in the first quarter of 2014. We sold the final 1.9 million shares in the current quarter. The timing of this last sale was important from a tax perspective. The timing allowed us to offset the gain with other items, minimizing the tax on foreign earnings. So the total realized value of the share consideration to Honeywell was $500 million, a nice upside compared to that $150 million basis in the stock. For each of the 3 lots that we sold, we have developed -- we have deployed the resulting gains for restructuring and other actions that proactively position the company for future growth and profitability. In this fourth quarter, the gains will be fully offset on an after-tax basis by a recognition of the cost of providing certain commercial OEM incentives. We have one significant content in the Air Transport and Business Aviation sectors, including 737 MAX, 777X, E2, A320neo, A330neo and a number of unannounced wins. The incentives become required in the fourth quarter when our customer achieves certain contractual milestones in platform development, which will include Honeywell avionics and/or mechanical content. \r\nIn the lower-left section of Page 4, you can see that there is very little tax on the $116 million pretax gain from the BEAV share sales. This reflects the tax planning that I mentioned. So the net after-tax gain is $114 million. Offsetting the gain is our recognition of $184 million of OEM incentives, which, after incorporating the tax benefit, will be a $114 million charge. \r\nOn a net-of-tax basis then, these 2 items fully offset one another; no impact to EPS for the quarter or full year as a result. The tax benefit will end up lowering Honeywell's estimated effective tax rate for the quarter to 25.6% and the full year to approximately 25.7%. \r\nThe P&L geography of the 2 items deserves some explaining because the cost for the OEM incentives is included in the Aerospace segment as a reduction of revenue, whereas the gain from the sale of the BEAV shares is not included in the Aerospace segment. \r\nI'll talk more about that in a minute on the next slide, but just to close on this slide, I want to point out that these actions will significantly benefit Aerospace over our Five-Year Plan and beyond. We believe that we're well positioned for future success with our commercial OE customers, as highlighted earlier, and there will continue to be OEM incentives reflected by Aero going forward consistent with that business model, but based on the current book of business, the future year-over-year impact of these incentives should be minimal. \r\nLet's turn to Page 5 where we will preview what the fourth quarter financials are expected to look like with the inclusion of the gain and its deployment to fund the Aero OEM incentives. On the left in the column labeled prior guidance, you see the fourth quarter 2014 guidance that we shared with you in October. And on the right is our revised outlook reflecting the impacts I just discussed. \r\nLet me first call your attention to the last 2 lines, net income and EPS. In both cases, there is no impact to our outlook for Q4. \r\nSo back to the top, starting with sales. We present the impact of $184 million OEM incentives on the reported fourth quarter 2014 growth for both Honeywell in total and the Aerospace segment itself. The $184 million of OEM incentives will be recorded as a reduction in revenue, and so the reported Honeywell sales growth guidance is now down 2% compared to 2013. Just to remind you, this treatment is consistent with our approach of not burdening our balance sheet, and therefore, subsequent earnings with capitalization of upfront incentives provided to customers. In contrast, many of our peers capitalize OEM incentives and depreciate the cost over the life of the projects. We believe charging the incentive costs upfront gives greater transparency to our OEM profitability in this segment. \r\nThe important takeaway on the sales line here is that while there are small puts and takes in individual businesses, there is no change to our organic sales growth guidance. We continue to forecast approximately 3% organic growth for Honeywell in total and approximately 2% organic growth for Aerospace. \r\nThe change to the Aero segment margin outlook is also $184 million. The revenue impact we noted flows to segment profit. And as a result, for the fourth quarter, we now anticipate 20 basis points of margin contraction for Honeywell in total and 130 basis points of margin contraction in Aero, again however, no change to the underlying performance of the business. \r\nMoving to the impact outside of segment profit or below the line. We've shown the $116 million pretax gain from the sale of the remaining BEAV shares as well as the $68 million net tax benefit, primarily from the Aero OEM incentives. You can see that the $184 million reduction from our previous segment profit guidance is fully offset by the gain on sale of the shares and the associated tax benefits. So when you net the impacts of these 2 items, the impact to net income is 0. We remain on track to our pro forma EPS guidance of $1.37 to $1.42, up 10% to 15% from 2013, representing another quarter of double-digit earnings growth. As a reminder, this excludes any mark-to-market adjustment related to our pension plans. \r\nBased on current interest rates and year-to-date asset returns, we do not expect a material mark-to-market adjustment to our U.S. plans in the fourth quarter, but there likely will be a mark-to-market adjustment in our international pension plans. You'll recall that this amounted to about $51 million in 2013. At this time, we're currently expecting it to be in the range of $300 million to $400 million on a pretax basis in the fourth quarter of 2014. \r\nSo before turning our attention to the outlook for 2015, I want to briefly summarize what we're expecting for the full year of 2014. I am on Slide 6. For the year, we're estimating sales to be up approximately 3% on both a reported and organic basis. The updated sales range of $40.1 billion to $40.2 billion reflects the impact from the $184 million Aero OEM incentives I just discussed. Order rates continue to be healthy as we exit the year, building good momentum into 2015. We're also expecting another record year for segment margins driven by commercial excellence and strong productivity benefits across the portfolio. \r\nMargins are expected to be 16.6% on a reported basis or 17% excluding the Aero OEM incentives. The 17% represents an improvement of 70 basis points versus 2013. This margin expansion is translated into strong EPS growth. Pro forma EPS is expected to be in the range of $5.50 to $5.55, up 11% to 12% from 2013. So when looking at Honeywell's performance over the last 5 years, we grew pro forma earnings double digits every year at a compounded rate of 16%. And once again, we stuck by our earnings outlook all year in 2014, increasing the low end of our range 3 times to reflect the strong year-to-date performance. \r\nFinally, free cash flow is expected to be approximately $3.9 billion, up about 15% versus 2013 despite an approximate 15% increase in CapEx investments in the areas we have previously described, notably in PMT. \r\nSo with the end of the year in sight, we feel good about how we're exiting the year and the implications for 2015. \r\nI'm now on Slide 7. We're showing the expected GDP growth by region in real terms for both 2014 and 2015, probably not new information for most of you but something worth quickly reviewing. These are the latest numbers from Global Insight. And as you can see, we're expecting modest improvement in growth across most major geographies. You can also see, while we remain focused on increasing our presence in high-growth regions, the population growth, urbanization and infrastructure development continue to create attractive opportunities across our entire portfolio. China and India, for example, are both expected to grow in the high single-digit range. Our portfolio is well positioned to benefit from and even outpace in some cases these attractive market growth rates, which I'll discuss in a moment. \r\nIn total, this would suggest that global GDP growth is likely to accelerate by around 0.5% in 2015. Not the greatest tailwind, but an improvement, nonetheless. And it is important to note that this expected GDP growth does not reflect the impacts, if any, of continued low oil prices. I will get into the oil price impacts on Honeywell in a few minutes, but overall, lower oil is a net positive for our portfolio. \r\nI'm now on Slide 8, and starting on the left-hand side of the page, you can see our sales mix by major geography. Our exposure in high-growth regions has expanded steadily over the last 10 years, now representing almost 1/4 of our total business. To put that into perspective, HGRs represented only about 10% of our portfolio back in 2014. The growth strategies that we have continued to share with our investor base, including becoming a Chinese competitor, East-For-East and East-To-West, has enabled this expansion with HGRs expected to drive about 50% of sales growth over the course of our Five-Year Plan. And our overall business outside the U.S. represents about 55% of Honeywell sales. \r\nIn the U.S., we're planning for continued modest improvements in organic sales growth. The short-cycle businesses are expected to continue to see low- to mid-single-digit organic growth consistent with the order rates we've seen as we exit 2014. And although stabilizing, our U.S. Defense & Space business will continue to be a slight headwind to growth in 2015. We expect to see continued declines in the D&S products businesses in the U.S., partly offset by solid growth in our U.S. services business, which has been down double digits in each of the last 2 years. \r\nIn other developed countries, we're expecting growth at similar levels to what we've seen the past few years. In Europe, in particular, the markets continue to be challenging, but we're expecting modest organic sales growth in 2015, which is very consistent with the growth rates we saw in the region in 2013 and 2014. So overall, we characterize Europe as stable for Honeywell. \r\nGrowth in the high-growth regions will continue to outpace that in developed regions supported by new product introductions and by traction from increased sales and marketing resources. China continues to be a strong market for us, both in the short- and long-cycle side to the portfolio. And we continue to expect good growth in areas like the Middle East and India, where our focus strategy is working and infrastructure investment continues to be strong. \r\nI now want to discuss the 2015 outlooks for each of the SBGs, starting with Aerospace on Slide 9. Take a look at the industry drivers on the upper left. Flight hours for air transport in regional are expected to grow at a similar pace in 2015 as 2014. On the business jet side, flight hours for large-cabin aircraft are expected to continue to reflect strong growth in 2015, up mid to high single-digit, reflecting the continued healthy demand in the cabin-size sector, where we are more exposed. We have a number of new engine platforms ramping up in 2015, which serve to drive growth in excess of the market. \r\nStaying on the left part of the slide. On Defense spending, we're expecting 2015 to be consistent with what we've seen in 2014. As I said, in the U.S., we expect a flat to modestly declining base budget adjusted for inflation, and we'll continue to monitor the ongoing activities in Congress in this area. International budgets continue to grow, however, and with 25% of our Defense & Space sales outside the U.S., we're expecting international to drive an overall return to growth for Defense & Space for the full year. \r\nAt the bottom left of the slide, you can see some of our Transportation Systems indicators, including vehicle production, both light vehicles and commercial vehicles as well as turbo penetration. Light vehicle production should be up again in 2015 with Europe continuing to see modest growth. In commercial vehicles, we're expecting the recovery we saw in 2014 to modestly continue into 2015. As for turbo penetration, light-vehicle diesel is expected to be roughly flat year-over-year. However, gas continues to see healthy turbo adoption rates, particularly in the U.S. and China. \r\nSo what this means for Aero is on the right side of the slide. We're expecting Aerospace organic sales growth in the range of 2% to 3%, and again, this includes the -- or this excludes the impact from the fourth quarter OEM incentives. So the growth is driven by good growth in the commercial businesses and the return to growth in Defense & Space that I just mentioned. Reported sales growth will be lower, roughly flat, primarily due to Friction Materials divestiture and the impact of FX. \r\nOn the lower-right portion of the page, you can see the estimated organic sales growth ranges for each business unit with the colored circles denoting the pace of growth for 2015. In commercial OE, we're expecting strength in BGA, driven by new platform wins. While on the ATR side, growth is expected to be in line with the estimated delivery rates we shared with you at our March Investor Day. The commercial aftermarket is expected to grow mid single digit, consistent performance in both ATR and BGA with an expected improvement in airline repair and overhaul activity and higher maintenance events in BGA. \r\nWe're encouraged by the growth in Defense & Space in 2015, building on the positive growth we saw in that business in the second half in 2014. In fact, our firm backlog in Defense & Space is up 8% since the end of 2013. \r\nTransportation Systems is expecting to continue its trend of strong growth in 2015, growing mid to high single digit organically and benefiting from significant new launches. As we highlighted earlier, the global turbo penetration rates, particularly on the gas side, continued to accelerate, and we're expecting good growth in both the U.S. and China. \r\nAerospace margin expansion continues to be a good story, and 2015 will be more of the same. Segment margins are expected to be up in the range of 150 to 180 basis points on a reported basis or 50 to 80 basis points excluding the impact of the fourth quarter Aero OEM incentives with contributions from both the legacy Aerospace business and Transportation Systems. We're once again executing on our plan for Aerospace to deliver healthy profits in a slow growth environment. The business is doing this through deployment of our key enablers with a particular focus on supply chain productivity and functional spending, which will support further margin expansion beyond 2015. \r\nSo I'm now on Slide 10, which shows our outlook for ACS. You can see on the left the 3 main verticals served by ACS: residential, commercial and industrial, including the expected global growth in each of the segments, in all cases, similar or improving market trends. ACS has a global portfolio and has been the beneficiary in 2014 of spending increases for residential improvements, particularly in the U.S. This is evidenced by strong growth in ECC and Security and we're expecting that trend to continue into next year as we ramp up our investments in the Connected Home. We're also encouraged by the expected acceleration of commercial construction spending and the continued solid growth on the industrial side. \r\nMoving to the right side of the page, we're expecting ACS organic sales to be up 4% to 5%, led by new product introductions, further penetration in high-growth regions, stable residential growth and a continued nonres recovery. Also backlog and service bank growth will support an improvement in Building Solution. On a reported basis, ACS sales are expected to be up 1% to 3%, reflecting foreign exchange headwinds, in particular from the euro. Within the business units, we're expecting mid-single-digit growth in ESS and low- to mid-single-digit growth in BSD. Residential markets are expected to grow at a steady pace similar to what we saw in 2014 with both ECC and Security benefiting from new product introductions. We're continuing to accelerate our investments in the Connected Home space, a fast-growing area where we have a strong position. On the nonres side, the commercial products businesses have seen a modest uptick in sales growth in 2014, and we expect the positive trend to continue in 2015. We're seeing continued growth in the Americas driven by improvement in our ECC and fire systems businesses as well as an expected acceleration in our high-growth regions tied to our energy-efficient and connected product offerings. \r\nIn the industrial markets, we're expecting higher sales of industrial safety equipment as well as continued strong growth from the Scanning & Mobility business where we're benefiting from new wins, which ramped throughout 2014. In Building Solutions, our backlog and service bank growth support the sales growth in 2015. We've seen orders growth, particularly with the municipalities and federal governments that gives us confidence as we head into next year. \r\nACS margins are expected to be up 60 to 90 basis points, reflecting significant productivity benefits partially offset by increased investments for growth, primarily in the Connected Home space and in high-growth regions. We continue to identify and implement opportunities to take better advantage of our scale across the ACS portfolio in areas like ISC, R&D and marketing, a more connected ACS, if you will. In addition, the restructuring that we funded in prior periods continues to provide runway for further margin expansion. So a strong year expected for ACS in terms of organic sales growth and margin expansion. \r\nI'm now on Slide 11, with the outlook for PMT. On the upper left side of the slide, you can see our long-cycle backlog as of year end 2013 and expectation for 2014 year end backlog of $4.6 billion, representing about 8% organic growth. The backlogs cut across refining, petrochemical and gas verticals and will be realized on an average over the next 18 months. On larger projects, which represent roughly 10% to 15% of the portfolio, the runoff tend to be a bit longer, let's say, 24 to 36 months. \r\nYou can see on the bottom left side of the slide where oil prices sit today versus the 2014 average. The key question we've been tackling internally and externally is what impact the lower oil prices will have on our PMT businesses. \r\nFirst, as Darius continues to emphasize, the upstream exploration and production part of the value chain is a small portion of UOP and HPS business, call it 10% to 15%. And even in that small 10% to 15%, the backlogs have been holding up we believe because our business is focused on larger, well-capitalized players with scale and a strong cost position. In addition, and this is quite possibly a bigger impact, the significant concentration that we do have is in the mid and downstream parts of the value chain where our customers will benefit from the lower cost influence and potentially higher volumes as lower prices create higher demand for gas and other refined products. I don't want to oversell it, but we think this bodes well for UOP and HPS. \r\nMoving to the right half of the slide, the PMT business is expected to see growth broadly across the portfolio with robust orders growth and backlog positions at both UOP and Process Solutions supporting a sales acceleration in 2015. In total, we're expecting organic sales growth in the range of 4% to 5%. Due to FX, reported sales growth will be in the 1% to 3% range. The CapEx investments we're making are starting to come online to meet firm orders and demand in 2015. As a reminder, 2015 will be the peak year for PMT's CapEx, setting up further inflection points in 2016 and 2017 in sales from new capacity additions across both UOP and Advanced Materials, particularly for new UOP catalysts and in flooring products to support the ramp in solstice sales. \r\nPMT segment margins are expected to be up in the range of 80 to 110 basis points with margin expansion across each of the 3 main businesses. We expect a benefit from commercial excellence, continued productivity initiatives and the impact of higher volumes as well as moderating price/raws headwinds in Advanced Materials. \r\nLet's move to Slide 12. Despite some of the positive macro trends emerging for 2015, we do recognize that there remains some concern around the price of oil. We think it is actually a net upside for Honeywell, and this slide is intended to help you understand our thinking on this. I already talked about the impact of lower oil on UOP and HPS, again a net positive, and our backlogs are holding up well. \r\nLet me touch on a couple of the other first derivative impacts of lower oil on the Honeywell portfolio. Sales growth in our Resins & Chemicals business will be impacted by lower oil prices given that formula contracts cause revenues to fluctuate with the market price of raw materials, including oil. However, the pricing formulas also preserve operating income. So expected top line headwind but little in terms of profit impact. \r\nIn terms of operating expenses, we expect favorability across the enterprise, including freight, utilities and other supply chain costs. Our sourcing teams are hard at work, focused on ensuring that we negotiate well to realize the benefit. \r\nOn the second derivative impacts on the lower half of the page, we also see more positive or neutral than negative. For example, for commercial airlines, 2015 is expected to be a record profit year. Operating costs will be lower and volumes should increase. This should help our aftermarket business. As for the OE business, we believe that new aircraft demand may be as sensitive or more sensitive to financing costs. So unless oil stays low for several years, we expect very little change in customer buying patterns. We expect demand-side favorability across our ACS portfolio, and our positions in high-growth regions will provide some further upside as we service customers in key regions like India and China, which are large importers of oil. \r\nSo overall, while we continue to watch this closely, we see lower oil as good for the Honeywell portfolio. \r\nI'm now on Slide 13 to walk you through the 2015 outlook for Honeywell. You're familiar with this format as it's the same we've used in the past to frame our annual guidance. We're expecting organic sales growth of approximately 4%. Reported sales growth will be lower, in the range of 1% to 2%, primarily due to the impact of the Friction Materials divestiture and the stronger dollar. Segment margins are expected to be 17.6% to 17.9%, up 100 to 130 basis points or 60 to 90 basis points excluding the impact from the fourth quarter Aero OEM incentives. We're expecting the margin expansion to be driven primarily by commercial excellence and volume leverage, continued traction on the Honeywell enablers I mentioned earlier, so HOS Gold, OEF and Functional Transformation as well as savings from prior-period restructuring actions. Each of our businesses continues to benefit from our proactive restructuring activities, which we expect to yield about $125 million of incremental savings in 2015. \r\nThe outlook is based on a euro rate of approximately 1.20 at the midpoint versus an average of 1.33 that we've experienced in 2014. Although other currencies will have an impact, our largest exposure remains the euro. And as a reminder, we've hedged roughly 50% of our 2015 euro exposure by locking in Transportation Systems at an approximate 1.26 euro rate. Considering these impacts, FX will be a sales headwind for 2015 of approximately $650 million, which works out to about $0.10 per share. \r\nItems below segment profit are expected to be stable with any potential pension upside being offset by incremental restructuring actions that will drive productivity in future years. As interest rates in our planned returns currently sit, this could mean approximately $50 million to $100 million higher pension income, which will be offset by restructuring. \r\nEPS is expected to be in the range of $5.95 to $6.15, up 8% to 12% on a pro forma basis, assuming a tax rate of 26.5% and share count roughly flat to 2014 levels. And expected continuation of our double-digit earnings growth and outperformance versus our peer group driven by strong operational performance and a consistent level of execution. \r\nFinally, free cash flow is expected to increase by 8% to 10% in 2015 with CapEx investments peaking at roughly 2x depreciation. At a more normalized rate of CapEx investment, we would expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 100%. \r\nLet's now turn to Slide 14 for a quick wrap-up before turning it back over to Mark for Q&A. \r\n2014 was another strong year for Honeywell, where we set and delivered on high expectations. As we said in the past, we have a well-positioned and diverse portfolio and a management team focused on execution. We've once again also deployed nonoperating gains in a manner that positions us for growth in 2015 and beyond. We're finishing the year as expected with anticipated fourth quarter performance helping us to achieve the high end of the earnings guidance we set last December. \r\nAs we look towards 2015, we'll stay flexible, leveraging the Honeywell enablers and HOS Gold, in particular, to drive productivity and maintain our tight cost discipline while continuing to invest in future growth. Innovation and new product introductions remain a key priority as well as the investments we're making to further penetrate high-growth regions. Considering this and the pace of orders growth we've seen in both short- and long-cycle parts of our portfolio, we expect an acceleration of organic growth next year. And we think we've appropriately factored in the potential impact associated with lower oil prices. \r\nSo overall, what we've told you today keeps us on track to achieve the long-term targets we unveiled back in March. In 2014, we've delivered nicely against the 45 to 75 basis points margin improvement we committed to in our Five-Year Plan, delivering 70 basis points of improvement, adjusted for the B/E Aerospace gain deployment and Aero OEM incentives. Considering everything we've discussed today, we believe our guidance for next year, both top and bottom line, is balanced in what remains a slow-growth macro environment. We're confident in our outlook, which we think positions us well for top-tier performance again in 2015.\r\nSo with that, Mark, let's turn it over for Q&A.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Tom. Rich, if you would, please open the line for questions.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Mark Macaluso (Executives)】\nThank you, Rich. Good morning, and welcome to Honeywell's 2015 Outlook Conference Call. With me here today are Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Tom Szlosek; and Vice President of Investor Relations, Elena Doom. This call and webcast, including any non-GAAP reconciliations, are available on our website at www.honeywell.com/investor. \r\nNote that elements of this presentation contain forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the world and of our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can change, and we'd ask that you interpret them in that light. \r\nWe identify the principal risks and uncertainties that affect our performance in our Form 10-K and other SEC filings.\r\nThis morning, we will review our financial expectations for the remainder of 2014 and discuss our 2015 planning, building on the framework we gave you back in October, and of course, we'll allow time for your questions. \r\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Tom Szlosek.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Thomas Szlosek (Executives)】\nThanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin on Slide 3 by confirming the fourth quarter is on track with about 2 weeks left in the year. We are exiting 2014 with strong momentum, evidenced by a continuation of positive short-cycle order rate trends and a robust backlog in our long-cycle businesses. We are reaffirming our full year 2014 pro forma EPS guidance of $5.50 to $5.55 a share, up 11% to 12% versus 2013. We continue to expect organic sales growth of approximately 3% for both the fourth quarter and the full year. \r\nAs I'm sure you've seen by now in our press release, we sold the remaining 1.9 million of BEAV shares in the fourth quarter and are deploying the gain to fund certain Aerospace OEM incentives. I'll walk through all the details in a moment, but wanted to reiterate that the transactions have no impact on our fourth quarter net income, EPS or free cash flow guidance and position Aero well for future growth with the biggest impacts on 2016 and 2017. \r\nLooking ahead, 2015 is poised to be another terrific year for Honeywell. We have and will continue to invest in R&D and sales and marketing resources globally. This focus on innovation has enabled big wins in the marketplace. There are many examples that we have shared with you throughout the year, and they pervade our entire portfolio. Our penetration in the high-growth regions is relentless, and we continue to drive CapEx investments in high ROI projects, particularly in PMT. \r\nWhile expecting to achieve double-digit free cash flow growth, we are also investing in CapEx at a rate approximately 1.5x to 2x depreciation, a trend we expect to continue into 2015. We've also been able to proactively fund restructuring projects, and we're expecting over $140 million for the full year of 2014, which allows us to drive sustainable productivity action. \r\nThe Honeywell enablers continue to result in growth and operational excellence across the company. Key initiatives like Velocity Product Development, Organizational Effectiveness and Functional Transformation are resulting in significant benefits across the portfolio, and we are broadening our approach to HOS Gold. You'll remember that our focus for HOS was first on the supply chain and then to our product development process. That initiative has paid off well, and we are now applying HOS Gold across all business processes in our 70 HOS Gold enterprises, which will enable and sustain exceptional growth and productivity improvements. We are excited to share more about this at our March Investor Day. \r\nToday, we'll provide an update on the markets we serve and a bottom-up portfolio view that supports our 2015 outlook. Our plans reflect a modest growth environment. So we have once again been conservative on cost assumptions. We've also incorporated the impacts from the stronger U.S. dollar. For example, you will see that we have planned the euro at $1.20. We feel confident that with our balanced portfolio mix, alignment to favorable macro trends, focused growth initiatives and cost discipline, we'll continue to outperform. \r\nI'm now on Slide 4, which presents a brief recap of the BEAV share gains and deployment actions, which will yield benefits in 2015 and beyond, principally in 2016 and 2017. You will recall that we've divested the Consumables businesses --  the Consumables Solutions business to B/E Aerospace in 2008. At the time, we received cash proceeds of $900 million plus 6 million shares of BEAV common stock with a fair value at the time of roughly $150 million. We sold 2.6 million shares in the fourth quarter of 2013 and 1.5 million shares in the first quarter of 2014. We sold the final 1.9 million shares in the current quarter. The timing of this last sale was important from a tax perspective. The timing allowed us to offset the gain with other items, minimizing the tax on foreign earnings. So the total realized value of the share consideration to Honeywell was $500 million, a nice upside compared to that $150 million basis in the stock. For each of the 3 lots that we sold, we have developed -- we have deployed the resulting gains for restructuring and other actions that proactively position the company for future growth and profitability. In this fourth quarter, the gains will be fully offset on an after-tax basis by a recognition of the cost of providing certain commercial OEM incentives. We have one significant content in the Air Transport and Business Aviation sectors, including 737 MAX, 777X, E2, A320neo, A330neo and a number of unannounced wins. The incentives become required in the fourth quarter when our customer achieves certain contractual milestones in platform development, which will include Honeywell avionics and/or mechanical content. \r\nIn the lower-left section of Page 4, you can see that there is very little tax on the $116 million pretax gain from the BEAV share sales. This reflects the tax planning that I mentioned. So the net after-tax gain is $114 million. Offsetting the gain is our recognition of $184 million of OEM incentives, which, after incorporating the tax benefit, will be a $114 million charge. \r\nOn a net-of-tax basis then, these 2 items fully offset one another; no impact to EPS for the quarter or full year as a result. The tax benefit will end up lowering Honeywell's estimated effective tax rate for the quarter to 25.6% and the full year to approximately 25.7%. \r\nThe P&L geography of the 2 items deserves some explaining because the cost for the OEM incentives is included in the Aerospace segment as a reduction of revenue, whereas the gain from the sale of the BEAV shares is not included in the Aerospace segment. \r\nI'll talk more about that in a minute on the next slide, but just to close on this slide, I want to point out that these actions will significantly benefit Aerospace over our Five-Year Plan and beyond. We believe that we're well positioned for future success with our commercial OE customers, as highlighted earlier, and there will continue to be OEM incentives reflected by Aero going forward consistent with that business model, but based on the current book of business, the future year-over-year impact of these incentives should be minimal. \r\nLet's turn to Page 5 where we will preview what the fourth quarter financials are expected to look like with the inclusion of the gain and its deployment to fund the Aero OEM incentives. On the left in the column labeled prior guidance, you see the fourth quarter 2014 guidance that we shared with you in October. And on the right is our revised outlook reflecting the impacts I just discussed. \r\nLet me first call your attention to the last 2 lines, net income and EPS. In both cases, there is no impact to our outlook for Q4. \r\nSo back to the top, starting with sales. We present the impact of $184 million OEM incentives on the reported fourth quarter 2014 growth for both Honeywell in total and the Aerospace segment itself. The $184 million of OEM incentives will be recorded as a reduction in revenue, and so the reported Honeywell sales growth guidance is now down 2% compared to 2013. Just to remind you, this treatment is consistent with our approach of not burdening our balance sheet, and therefore, subsequent earnings with capitalization of upfront incentives provided to customers. In contrast, many of our peers capitalize OEM incentives and depreciate the cost over the life of the projects. We believe charging the incentive costs upfront gives greater transparency to our OEM profitability in this segment. \r\nThe important takeaway on the sales line here is that while there are small puts and takes in individual businesses, there is no change to our organic sales growth guidance. We continue to forecast approximately 3% organic growth for Honeywell in total and approximately 2% organic growth for Aerospace. \r\nThe change to the Aero segment margin outlook is also $184 million. The revenue impact we noted flows to segment profit. And as a result, for the fourth quarter, we now anticipate 20 basis points of margin contraction for Honeywell in total and 130 basis points of margin contraction in Aero, again however, no change to the underlying performance of the business. \r\nMoving to the impact outside of segment profit or below the line. We've shown the $116 million pretax gain from the sale of the remaining BEAV shares as well as the $68 million net tax benefit, primarily from the Aero OEM incentives. You can see that the $184 million reduction from our previous segment profit guidance is fully offset by the gain on sale of the shares and the associated tax benefits. So when you net the impacts of these 2 items, the impact to net income is 0. We remain on track to our pro forma EPS guidance of $1.37 to $1.42, up 10% to 15% from 2013, representing another quarter of double-digit earnings growth. As a reminder, this excludes any mark-to-market adjustment related to our pension plans. \r\nBased on current interest rates and year-to-date asset returns, we do not expect a material mark-to-market adjustment to our U.S. plans in the fourth quarter, but there likely will be a mark-to-market adjustment in our international pension plans. You'll recall that this amounted to about $51 million in 2013. At this time, we're currently expecting it to be in the range of $300 million to $400 million on a pretax basis in the fourth quarter of 2014. \r\nSo before turning our attention to the outlook for 2015, I want to briefly summarize what we're expecting for the full year of 2014. I am on Slide 6. For the year, we're estimating sales to be up approximately 3% on both a reported and organic basis. The updated sales range of $40.1 billion to $40.2 billion reflects the impact from the $184 million Aero OEM incentives I just discussed. Order rates continue to be healthy as we exit the year, building good momentum into 2015. We're also expecting another record year for segment margins driven by commercial excellence and strong productivity benefits across the portfolio. \r\nMargins are expected to be 16.6% on a reported basis or 17% excluding the Aero OEM incentives. The 17% represents an improvement of 70 basis points versus 2013. This margin expansion is translated into strong EPS growth. Pro forma EPS is expected to be in the range of $5.50 to $5.55, up 11% to 12% from 2013. So when looking at Honeywell's performance over the last 5 years, we grew pro forma earnings double digits every year at a compounded rate of 16%. And once again, we stuck by our earnings outlook all year in 2014, increasing the low end of our range 3 times to reflect the strong year-to-date performance. \r\nFinally, free cash flow is expected to be approximately $3.9 billion, up about 15% versus 2013 despite an approximate 15% increase in CapEx investments in the areas we have previously described, notably in PMT. \r\nSo with the end of the year in sight, we feel good about how we're exiting the year and the implications for 2015. \r\nI'm now on Slide 7. We're showing the expected GDP growth by region in real terms for both 2014 and 2015, probably not new information for most of you but something worth quickly reviewing. These are the latest numbers from Global Insight. And as you can see, we're expecting modest improvement in growth across most major geographies. You can also see, while we remain focused on increasing our presence in high-growth regions, the population growth, urbanization and infrastructure development continue to create attractive opportunities across our entire portfolio. China and India, for example, are both expected to grow in the high single-digit range. Our portfolio is well positioned to benefit from and even outpace in some cases these attractive market growth rates, which I'll discuss in a moment. \r\nIn total, this would suggest that global GDP growth is likely to accelerate by around 0.5% in 2015. Not the greatest tailwind, but an improvement, nonetheless. And it is important to note that this expected GDP growth does not reflect the impacts, if any, of continued low oil prices. I will get into the oil price impacts on Honeywell in a few minutes, but overall, lower oil is a net positive for our portfolio. \r\nI'm now on Slide 8, and starting on the left-hand side of the page, you can see our sales mix by major geography. Our exposure in high-growth regions has expanded steadily over the last 10 years, now representing almost 1/4 of our total business. To put that into perspective, HGRs represented only about 10% of our portfolio back in 2014. The growth strategies that we have continued to share with our investor base, including becoming a Chinese competitor, East-For-East and East-To-West, has enabled this expansion with HGRs expected to drive about 50% of sales growth over the course of our Five-Year Plan. And our overall business outside the U.S. represents about 55% of Honeywell sales. \r\nIn the U.S., we're planning for continued modest improvements in organic sales growth. The short-cycle businesses are expected to continue to see low- to mid-single-digit organic growth consistent with the order rates we've seen as we exit 2014. And although stabilizing, our U.S. Defense & Space business will continue to be a slight headwind to growth in 2015. We expect to see continued declines in the D&S products businesses in the U.S., partly offset by solid growth in our U.S. services business, which has been down double digits in each of the last 2 years. \r\nIn other developed countries, we're expecting growth at similar levels to what we've seen the past few years. In Europe, in particular, the markets continue to be challenging, but we're expecting modest organic sales growth in 2015, which is very consistent with the growth rates we saw in the region in 2013 and 2014. So overall, we characterize Europe as stable for Honeywell. \r\nGrowth in the high-growth regions will continue to outpace that in developed regions supported by new product introductions and by traction from increased sales and marketing resources. China continues to be a strong market for us, both in the short- and long-cycle side to the portfolio. And we continue to expect good growth in areas like the Middle East and India, where our focus strategy is working and infrastructure investment continues to be strong. \r\nI now want to discuss the 2015 outlooks for each of the SBGs, starting with Aerospace on Slide 9. Take a look at the industry drivers on the upper left. Flight hours for air transport in regional are expected to grow at a similar pace in 2015 as 2014. On the business jet side, flight hours for large-cabin aircraft are expected to continue to reflect strong growth in 2015, up mid to high single-digit, reflecting the continued healthy demand in the cabin-size sector, where we are more exposed. We have a number of new engine platforms ramping up in 2015, which serve to drive growth in excess of the market. \r\nStaying on the left part of the slide. On Defense spending, we're expecting 2015 to be consistent with what we've seen in 2014. As I said, in the U.S., we expect a flat to modestly declining base budget adjusted for inflation, and we'll continue to monitor the ongoing activities in Congress in this area. International budgets continue to grow, however, and with 25% of our Defense & Space sales outside the U.S., we're expecting international to drive an overall return to growth for Defense & Space for the full year. \r\nAt the bottom left of the slide, you can see some of our Transportation Systems indicators, including vehicle production, both light vehicles and commercial vehicles as well as turbo penetration. Light vehicle production should be up again in 2015 with Europe continuing to see modest growth. In commercial vehicles, we're expecting the recovery we saw in 2014 to modestly continue into 2015. As for turbo penetration, light-vehicle diesel is expected to be roughly flat year-over-year. However, gas continues to see healthy turbo adoption rates, particularly in the U.S. and China. \r\nSo what this means for Aero is on the right side of the slide. We're expecting Aerospace organic sales growth in the range of 2% to 3%, and again, this includes the -- or this excludes the impact from the fourth quarter OEM incentives. So the growth is driven by good growth in the commercial businesses and the return to growth in Defense & Space that I just mentioned. Reported sales growth will be lower, roughly flat, primarily due to Friction Materials divestiture and the impact of FX. \r\nOn the lower-right portion of the page, you can see the estimated organic sales growth ranges for each business unit with the colored circles denoting the pace of growth for 2015. In commercial OE, we're expecting strength in BGA, driven by new platform wins. While on the ATR side, growth is expected to be in line with the estimated delivery rates we shared with you at our March Investor Day. The commercial aftermarket is expected to grow mid single digit, consistent performance in both ATR and BGA with an expected improvement in airline repair and overhaul activity and higher maintenance events in BGA. \r\nWe're encouraged by the growth in Defense & Space in 2015, building on the positive growth we saw in that business in the second half in 2014. In fact, our firm backlog in Defense & Space is up 8% since the end of 2013. \r\nTransportation Systems is expecting to continue its trend of strong growth in 2015, growing mid to high single digit organically and benefiting from significant new launches. As we highlighted earlier, the global turbo penetration rates, particularly on the gas side, continued to accelerate, and we're expecting good growth in both the U.S. and China. \r\nAerospace margin expansion continues to be a good story, and 2015 will be more of the same. Segment margins are expected to be up in the range of 150 to 180 basis points on a reported basis or 50 to 80 basis points excluding the impact of the fourth quarter Aero OEM incentives with contributions from both the legacy Aerospace business and Transportation Systems. We're once again executing on our plan for Aerospace to deliver healthy profits in a slow growth environment. The business is doing this through deployment of our key enablers with a particular focus on supply chain productivity and functional spending, which will support further margin expansion beyond 2015. \r\nSo I'm now on Slide 10, which shows our outlook for ACS. You can see on the left the 3 main verticals served by ACS: residential, commercial and industrial, including the expected global growth in each of the segments, in all cases, similar or improving market trends. ACS has a global portfolio and has been the beneficiary in 2014 of spending increases for residential improvements, particularly in the U.S. This is evidenced by strong growth in ECC and Security and we're expecting that trend to continue into next year as we ramp up our investments in the Connected Home. We're also encouraged by the expected acceleration of commercial construction spending and the continued solid growth on the industrial side. \r\nMoving to the right side of the page, we're expecting ACS organic sales to be up 4% to 5%, led by new product introductions, further penetration in high-growth regions, stable residential growth and a continued nonres recovery. Also backlog and service bank growth will support an improvement in Building Solution. On a reported basis, ACS sales are expected to be up 1% to 3%, reflecting foreign exchange headwinds, in particular from the euro. Within the business units, we're expecting mid-single-digit growth in ESS and low- to mid-single-digit growth in BSD. Residential markets are expected to grow at a steady pace similar to what we saw in 2014 with both ECC and Security benefiting from new product introductions. We're continuing to accelerate our investments in the Connected Home space, a fast-growing area where we have a strong position. On the nonres side, the commercial products businesses have seen a modest uptick in sales growth in 2014, and we expect the positive trend to continue in 2015. We're seeing continued growth in the Americas driven by improvement in our ECC and fire systems businesses as well as an expected acceleration in our high-growth regions tied to our energy-efficient and connected product offerings. \r\nIn the industrial markets, we're expecting higher sales of industrial safety equipment as well as continued strong growth from the Scanning & Mobility business where we're benefiting from new wins, which ramped throughout 2014. In Building Solutions, our backlog and service bank growth support the sales growth in 2015. We've seen orders growth, particularly with the municipalities and federal governments that gives us confidence as we head into next year. \r\nACS margins are expected to be up 60 to 90 basis points, reflecting significant productivity benefits partially offset by increased investments for growth, primarily in the Connected Home space and in high-growth regions. We continue to identify and implement opportunities to take better advantage of our scale across the ACS portfolio in areas like ISC, R&D and marketing, a more connected ACS, if you will. In addition, the restructuring that we funded in prior periods continues to provide runway for further margin expansion. So a strong year expected for ACS in terms of organic sales growth and margin expansion. \r\nI'm now on Slide 11, with the outlook for PMT. On the upper left side of the slide, you can see our long-cycle backlog as of year end 2013 and expectation for 2014 year end backlog of $4.6 billion, representing about 8% organic growth. The backlogs cut across refining, petrochemical and gas verticals and will be realized on an average over the next 18 months. On larger projects, which represent roughly 10% to 15% of the portfolio, the runoff tend to be a bit longer, let's say, 24 to 36 months. \r\nYou can see on the bottom left side of the slide where oil prices sit today versus the 2014 average. The key question we've been tackling internally and externally is what impact the lower oil prices will have on our PMT businesses. \r\nFirst, as Darius continues to emphasize, the upstream exploration and production part of the value chain is a small portion of UOP and HPS business, call it 10% to 15%. And even in that small 10% to 15%, the backlogs have been holding up we believe because our business is focused on larger, well-capitalized players with scale and a strong cost position. In addition, and this is quite possibly a bigger impact, the significant concentration that we do have is in the mid and downstream parts of the value chain where our customers will benefit from the lower cost influence and potentially higher volumes as lower prices create higher demand for gas and other refined products. I don't want to oversell it, but we think this bodes well for UOP and HPS. \r\nMoving to the right half of the slide, the PMT business is expected to see growth broadly across the portfolio with robust orders growth and backlog positions at both UOP and Process Solutions supporting a sales acceleration in 2015. In total, we're expecting organic sales growth in the range of 4% to 5%. Due to FX, reported sales growth will be in the 1% to 3% range. The CapEx investments we're making are starting to come online to meet firm orders and demand in 2015. As a reminder, 2015 will be the peak year for PMT's CapEx, setting up further inflection points in 2016 and 2017 in sales from new capacity additions across both UOP and Advanced Materials, particularly for new UOP catalysts and in flooring products to support the ramp in solstice sales. \r\nPMT segment margins are expected to be up in the range of 80 to 110 basis points with margin expansion across each of the 3 main businesses. We expect a benefit from commercial excellence, continued productivity initiatives and the impact of higher volumes as well as moderating price/raws headwinds in Advanced Materials. \r\nLet's move to Slide 12. Despite some of the positive macro trends emerging for 2015, we do recognize that there remains some concern around the price of oil. We think it is actually a net upside for Honeywell, and this slide is intended to help you understand our thinking on this. I already talked about the impact of lower oil on UOP and HPS, again a net positive, and our backlogs are holding up well. \r\nLet me touch on a couple of the other first derivative impacts of lower oil on the Honeywell portfolio. Sales growth in our Resins & Chemicals business will be impacted by lower oil prices given that formula contracts cause revenues to fluctuate with the market price of raw materials, including oil. However, the pricing formulas also preserve operating income. So expected top line headwind but little in terms of profit impact. \r\nIn terms of operating expenses, we expect favorability across the enterprise, including freight, utilities and other supply chain costs. Our sourcing teams are hard at work, focused on ensuring that we negotiate well to realize the benefit. \r\nOn the second derivative impacts on the lower half of the page, we also see more positive or neutral than negative. For example, for commercial airlines, 2015 is expected to be a record profit year. Operating costs will be lower and volumes should increase. This should help our aftermarket business. As for the OE business, we believe that new aircraft demand may be as sensitive or more sensitive to financing costs. So unless oil stays low for several years, we expect very little change in customer buying patterns. We expect demand-side favorability across our ACS portfolio, and our positions in high-growth regions will provide some further upside as we service customers in key regions like India and China, which are large importers of oil. \r\nSo overall, while we continue to watch this closely, we see lower oil as good for the Honeywell portfolio. \r\nI'm now on Slide 13 to walk you through the 2015 outlook for Honeywell. You're familiar with this format as it's the same we've used in the past to frame our annual guidance. We're expecting organic sales growth of approximately 4%. Reported sales growth will be lower, in the range of 1% to 2%, primarily due to the impact of the Friction Materials divestiture and the stronger dollar. Segment margins are expected to be 17.6% to 17.9%, up 100 to 130 basis points or 60 to 90 basis points excluding the impact from the fourth quarter Aero OEM incentives. We're expecting the margin expansion to be driven primarily by commercial excellence and volume leverage, continued traction on the Honeywell enablers I mentioned earlier, so HOS Gold, OEF and Functional Transformation as well as savings from prior-period restructuring actions. Each of our businesses continues to benefit from our proactive restructuring activities, which we expect to yield about $125 million of incremental savings in 2015. \r\nThe outlook is based on a euro rate of approximately 1.20 at the midpoint versus an average of 1.33 that we've experienced in 2014. Although other currencies will have an impact, our largest exposure remains the euro. And as a reminder, we've hedged roughly 50% of our 2015 euro exposure by locking in Transportation Systems at an approximate 1.26 euro rate. Considering these impacts, FX will be a sales headwind for 2015 of approximately $650 million, which works out to about $0.10 per share. \r\nItems below segment profit are expected to be stable with any potential pension upside being offset by incremental restructuring actions that will drive productivity in future years. As interest rates in our planned returns currently sit, this could mean approximately $50 million to $100 million higher pension income, which will be offset by restructuring. \r\nEPS is expected to be in the range of $5.95 to $6.15, up 8% to 12% on a pro forma basis, assuming a tax rate of 26.5% and share count roughly flat to 2014 levels. And expected continuation of our double-digit earnings growth and outperformance versus our peer group driven by strong operational performance and a consistent level of execution. \r\nFinally, free cash flow is expected to increase by 8% to 10% in 2015 with CapEx investments peaking at roughly 2x depreciation. At a more normalized rate of CapEx investment, we would expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 100%. \r\nLet's now turn to Slide 14 for a quick wrap-up before turning it back over to Mark for Q&A. \r\n2014 was another strong year for Honeywell, where we set and delivered on high expectations. As we said in the past, we have a well-positioned and diverse portfolio and a management team focused on execution. We've once again also deployed nonoperating gains in a manner that positions us for growth in 2015 and beyond. We're finishing the year as expected with anticipated fourth quarter performance helping us to achieve the high end of the earnings guidance we set last December. \r\nAs we look towards 2015, we'll stay flexible, leveraging the Honeywell enablers and HOS Gold, in particular, to drive productivity and maintain our tight cost discipline while continuing to invest in future growth. Innovation and new product introductions remain a key priority as well as the investments we're making to further penetrate high-growth regions. Considering this and the pace of orders growth we've seen in both short- and long-cycle parts of our portfolio, we expect an acceleration of organic growth next year. And we think we've appropriately factored in the potential impact associated with lower oil prices. \r\nSo overall, what we've told you today keeps us on track to achieve the long-term targets we unveiled back in March. In 2014, we've delivered nicely against the 45 to 75 basis points margin improvement we committed to in our Five-Year Plan, delivering 70 basis points of improvement, adjusted for the B/E Aerospace gain deployment and Aero OEM incentives. Considering everything we've discussed today, we believe our guidance for next year, both top and bottom line, is balanced in what remains a slow-growth macro environment. We're confident in our outlook, which we think positions us well for top-tier performance again in 2015.\r\nSo with that, Mark, let's turn it over for Q&A.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Mark Macaluso (Executives)】\nThanks, Tom. Rich, if you would, please open the line for questions.",
      "transcript_text3": "Just a couple of questions here. First, the annual operating plan process, I guess, would have largely concluded, although I know it's iterative, maybe right in the middle of oil coming down. And the slide you provided is very helpful, but I'm a little confused in terms of your commentary. You said that we factored in the impact of low oil prices, but you also talked about how there really isn't much impact at all this year anyway. So how did that kind of play out in terms of your bottom-up assessment of the impact?\n\n---\n\nYes, Steve, the most direct impact is on the Resins & Chemicals business. As you know, the inputs to that business are -- the cost inputs of that business are highly correlated to oil. And the contracts in that business, a large portion of the contracts in that business, have price adjustments for the raw material inputs. So you end up seeing an impact on the top line. But what really had served us well is that the way the adjustments work and the way the formulas work, the operating income itself is generally preserved. So that's the major impact that we've reflected. By the way, Steve, that's -- sales-wise, that's probably $115 million or so.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Well, if you're giving me the sales -- and then what would the bottom line impact be?\n\n---\n\nWell, I mean, we don't disclose the profit in those individual segments. But it would be -- it would not be impacted materially in any way by the price of the oil.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then another point on that slide, you talked about the downstream, basically positive impact. But how are you guys talking about things like the $32 billion Petronas project that was canceled in Canada or deferred. Some of those activities and actions, internally are you guys looking at that and just saying that's a one-off and actually this is still going to be more positive for us downstream?\n\n---\n\nYes, well, I mean, first of all, we were not a participant on that Petronas project. And -- but we continually assess the impact of oil on our backlog in both HPS and UOP. And as I said and I've tried to emphasize, not seeing anything in terms of delays or cancellations relating to the oil. And actually, some of those projects, like on the LNG side, they continue to provide some future order growth opportunity that we're pretty excited about.\n\n---\n\nOkay, all right. And maybe I'll just sneak one in before I hand off, but just on the capital deployment front, you talk about share count flat for 2014 levels. You've obviously got peak year on CapEx as you mentioned. But are you -- is the -- the M&A side, you now have been -- Roger has been at it for a little while now. Is part of your thinking on the buyback side kind of placeholder for M&A? And is that driving that commentary around just holding buybacks flat? Or is there something more at this point?\n\n---\n\nYes. Well, if you recall, back with our Five-Year Plan that we went through in March, our intention is that, from an overall capital deployment perspective is to return about half of the cash flow that we generate to shareowners in the form of dividends and share buybacks with the share buybacks coming on an opportunistic basis, the dividends increasing faster than earnings, and you'll note that we increased our dividends in the fourth quarter by 15%. So it should be a good signal for what our expectations are going forward on earnings. As far as the other half of the capital deployment, we reinvest that in the business. You know the piece that's --  the CapEx piece, and we've talked about the $10 billion in M&A. And so over the 5 years, we do expect to deploy that capital, and it could even [ph] be more. But we're -- we have a pipeline. It's active as you mentioned. Starting in April of this year, Roger in his Vice Chairman role, one of his primary responsibilities now is M&A and really trying to engage the other SBGs the way he did it in ACS, and we're starting to see an impact. I mean, the pipelines are pretty strong, and the organization, we've actually doubled down on our resources in the M&A organization itself. So while I can't share any specific details, we do feel like we're making good progress there.\n\n---\n\nSo Tom, really helpful to get that oil and gas slide in there. Just a question, it seems like you've got some good visibility on your 2015 growth. But how do you think about what's in your backlog today for '16 and beyond? And is there any risk from prior history that anything in your backlog today gets repriced or revalued?\n\n---\n\nYes. I mean, when you look at the more significant parts of our backlog, I talked about UOP and HPS. And I feel like the -- we're largely intact there, as I said. We're not seeing much of an impact. I mentioned that the Defense & Space backlog is actually up 8% since the beginning of the year, and that is a reflection of the nice progress the team has had in international, in particular. And then in terms of ACS, it's holding intact. So I feel like the 2015 is well positioned. As you know, the backlog diffusion varies by business in terms of when we actually see the impacts in subsequent periods. I mean, for example, Aerospace backlogs tend to show up in the P&L a little bit longer period -- over a longer period than, say, UOP and HPS. But the patterns that we've experienced in the past in terms of the expectations has not changed at all. So we think we're still in a similar mode.\n\n---\n\nBut I guess, just specifically, as it relates to UOP or in PMT, is there any risk that, that backlog gets repriced?\n\n---\n\nI guess there could be a risk of that. But when you consider the positioning of where we are, when you look at where the exposure in that portfolio is, we have very little in terms of the upstream. And a lot of the upstream pressure that we're seeing on the oil prices is showing up in the higher-cost producers that have -- that are highly leveraged. And so we don't have very much in terms of exposure to that space. And as I said, where we are exposed in that space, we feel like the customer base is well capitalized and has a strong cost position. When you look at the significant -- the more significant part of the portfolio or the majority of the portfolio is in mid and downstream. And you could see how refiners are doing. You could see how petrochemical facilities are doing. It's boding well so far. And past -- our past experience, we've looked at this a little bit, and the PMT team is confident that this is an overall positive on that front.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And maybe if I could sneak one more in on the margins, it seems like nice step-up in margins on the PMT business this year. You've got a tailwind from price/raw mix and then also the facilities coming online. Is there any chance you can give us a little bit more detail on how much of an impact you're getting from price/raw in '15?\n\n---\n\nYes, I would say the -- when you look at -- I mean, as you know, in Resins & Chemicals and in floorings, we've experienced some pressures from price/raws significantly, that moderates in 2015. I don't want to put an exact number on it, but range-wise, it will provide modest improvement in the margin rates in PMT.\n\n---\n\nIs it fair, Tom, to say off of the reported conversion rate, that it would be implied in the guidance as higher because of the impacts from the lower sales in R&C related to oil?\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nSo if you the stretch that out, the conversion rate would be probably in that 35% range.\n\n---\n\nAnd when you consider that and the FX and the Aero OEM, yes, that -- the conversion works exactly like we thought, yes.\n\n---\n\nI'm glad you're confident on oil and gas because the rest of us are a little nervous, so hopefully you're right. But is there a point though -- did you stress test the impact of $50 oil versus $58 or $45 oil? I mean, is there a point where your PMT guys say, okay, bets are all off, like there's going to be a bigger impact here?\n\n---\n\nYes, I mean, we have stress tested. We feel like between -- down to about $50, the 2015 plan, including all the backlog that we have, should be good. We're not, in this fourth quarter, we're not seeing any change to the expected order growth rates despite the prices that we've seen, Scott. So right now, between stress testing and the current -- the most current business, we feel like it's manageable.\n\n---\n\nOkay. I won't beat the dead horse. And then the one thing I thought was a little surprising when I saw the slide is that you expect your share count to be flat. With the cash you're generating, the balance sheet base you have, I would have thought, if you believe this guidance, your stock is pretty darn cheap. I mean, what's the -- I guess -- again getting to thresholds, I mean, what is the point on a stock price or a correction in the S&P that you start to say, hey, we need to change the plan here? Or is just share buybacks off the table completely?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think the way we're talking about deploying the capital, Scott, is not inconsistent with what we said in the Five-Year Plan, and we feel like the best returns that we can generate and provide right now are on the M&A side and our models for the deals that we're looking at continue to support that. And I would say that if there's -- if we go by a significant period of time and we haven't seen activity that supports that $10 billion run rate over the 5-year basis, maybe you'd see us take a different tack. But kind of right now, Dave's view is that's the direction he wants to go in.\n\n---\n\nOkay, fair enough. And then just quickly, I'll sneak one in. I mean, when you talk about the margin tailwind, which has really been a great story for you guys for quite some time now, but what -- is it possible to separate at the impact of HOS and what impact that has directly on margins? And what I mean is not HOS necessarily holistically, but the rate of change in gold versus Silver and silver versus bronze year-over-year. Is that possible to think about that now?\n\n---\n\nI mean, it's a little bit tough. The productivity that comes just in the supply chain itself tends to be around conversion costs as well as in areas like cost of poor quality, so warranty, defects, rework, scrap. And so we can look at those individual categories. But I'd say, overall, you have to look at the confluence of the impacts from OEF, the impacts from Functional Transformation, impacts from HOS Gold is all showing up in restructuring. Because when we undertake all those activities I mentioned, it has a need for -- significant need for exit costs, and you see us with a continued pipeline of restructuring activities. The other place that you see it is in our cost productivity on materials. So between those 2 areas, between the purchase -- outside purchase costs, whether it's direct or indirect, as well on the people costs, that's where the productivity is showing up. We don't isolate it to just HOS Gold. It comes from all the factors I mentioned.\n\n---\n\nSo just want to spin back to 4Q -- just want to tick a box on 4Q. $0.03 coming in line with the plan, but any puts and takes either by geography or by business to call out, Tom?\n\n---\n\nNothing significant other than the -- there's a little bit of that Resins & Chemicals impact in the fourth quarter as you would expect. But we've got other offsets in other parts of the portfolio. So net-net, not a significant difference from what we would have shared in October.\n\n---\n\nOkay, that's helpful. And then the 9% -- sorry, the high single-digit outlook for UOP, I guess, mid- to high single digits at UOP. I think you said 9% actually growth for next year. That's right, correct, Tom?\n\n---\n\nThink I said 9%. Did I?\n\n---\n\nI think we said towards high single digit.\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nHigh single digit, okay. Is there any change in what's driving that? You talk about the catalyst capacity ramp. Is that primarily driven by catalyst reload? So is it a bit more balanced than that?\n\n---\n\nYes, I mean, I think it's balanced across the portfolio, to be honest with you. I mean, when you look at the gas processing business, really healthy backlog there. Catalyst backlog is strong as well. And even on the equipment side, the PTU side, all parts of that UOP portfolio are performing well.\n\n---\n\nOkay, okay. And then just a final one on, I guess, on pension. You put in the new mortality schedules. I think you were one of the first ones, I think that was probably last year. Obviously, we've had an update on that. Any impact from that, Tom?\n\n---\n\nSo let me just be clear on that, Nigel, because what we did in the -- it was 2013 was we adopted the BB Scale of the existing mortality table, for what that's worth. And that was -- the impact on that was about $0.5 billion on PBO. We don't think very many of our peers have done that. And then the next requirement is, as you say, to adopt the new mortality tables. That likely will be required in 2016. And when we do that, we're expecting another $0.5 billion impact on PBO barring any types of changes that we would make in the benefits.\n\n---\n\nAnd right now, would you expect that to have a P&L impact or a cash impact?\n\n---\n\nIt shouldn't have a cash impact. And from a P&L perspective...\n\n---\n\nYes, it's going to be -- with the quarter capacity that we have in the U.S. on the MTM piece, it would have likely no impact.\n\n---\n\nJust a couple quick things. Tom, on CapEx, can you actually give us the dollar number and how much you expect it to decline in '16 given that '15 is the top here?\n\n---\n\nYes, I guess I'd put it in the range of our history, Jeff. We've generally been in the $800 million to $900 million range before we started ramping up. We'll get to about $1.3 billion in 2015. So I would say somewhere between those 2 endpoints is where I would expect to see it on an ongoing basis.\n\n---\n\nSo you won't get down that far in '16. No, you're not saying...\n\n---\n\nNo, no, no. Yes, '15 and '16 will be -- still be -- it'll be $1.1 billion in '14, probably $1.3 billion in '15. '16 will come down a little bit but not materially. Then you start to see it in 2017 and beyond.\n\n---\n\nIs R&D up in 2015 in dollars or percent of sales?\n\n---\n\nAs a percentage of sales, it will be slightly up. We're still around that 5%, call it, 4.9% for 2014, 5.1% for 2015.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Then just a couple quick ones. All else being equal, doesn't the formula pricing of $115 million revenue impact kind of explain all the margin improvement in PMT? I mean, I know all else isn't equal, really. There's a lot moving on, but you got $115 million revenue impact and a little to no associated profit impact. Looks like over 100 bps of margin.\n\n---\n\nThere's margin expansion across the entire portfolio, Jeff, in 2015. So UOP -- remember, UOP margins were down in 2014, so they get a nice lift in 2015. Process Solutions really drove all of the margin improvement in 2014 for PMT. So you see that benefit continues but not at the same pace in '15 for Process. And in Advanced Materials, again, margins were down as you alluded to, primarily due to the price/raws headwinds we had in R&C and in flooring Products. [indiscernible] So you see some benefits in '15, but if you looked at the segments independently, UOP would be the biggest contributor.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then just one quick one, just back to kind of a share repurchase question. In October, the stock spent a couple weeks in the 80s and actually hit a 52-week low. I mean, did that entice any interest in stepping up a little bit on repo?\n\n---\n\nYes, like I said, we didn't really view that as the most effective way of using our capital even at that time. Of course, we look at the share price every day, and we take it into account. We're not ignoring it blindly, but we're looking at it from a long-term basis.\n\n---\n\nCan you -- I know you guys threw out a bunch of program numbers or programs on the Aerospace side that the charge was applicable to. Can you maybe give a little bit more detail on what were some of the bigger programs represented in the charge? And also, what stage these programs are on if they were -- been -- if they were recently awarded business or programs that have been going on for a while.\n\n---\n\nYes. Well, I mean, we're not in a position really to talk about the individual commercial arrangements. But the programs that I did mention are contributing significant value to the portfolio, both in the next 5 years as well as the ensuing, call it, 20- to 30-year service period. And the $184 million, that gives us a nice lift, particularly in 2016 and 2017 when these incentives would have been peaking. And so we've been able to accelerate those into 2014, such that over that 5-year period, the year-to-year impact from the OEM incentives would be minimized.\n\n---\n\nI got it. So there was a -- there's kind of a timing element here where you kind of chose to take these offsets?\n\n---\n\nYes. And it's -- just to emphasize, it has very little impact on 2015. This is more of a Five-Year Plan kind of thing.\n\n---\n\nBut again, this wasn't something that, hey, came up in fourth quarter and you go in and sell some stock. I mean, this is a kind of planned, opportunistic type of dynamic is what I'm hearing?\n\n---\n\nYes, I mean, it is -- the amounts become due as our customers reach certain milestones. So the milestone could be the delivery of a drawing or the achievement of certain production volumes or something that's certified by the customer that then necessitates us to be obligated to make the payments. So that's how it works, and a number of those milestones were attained in the fourth quarter.\n\n---\n\nGot it. And is this a new development? I mean, obviously, Boeing has talked a lot about partnering for success. And is this -- without that, would there still be these types of incentive payments?\n\n---\n\nNo. I would say, Steve, that all of our OEMs have their own moniker that they apply to their productivity initiatives with their suppliers. And the model that we're describing is very, very consistent with the way we've done business with all of them in the past and continue to do so going forward.\n\n---\n\nRight. I'm sure you guys have a different moniker. One last question, on Slide 13, below-the-line stable pension upside offset by restructuring, any real change there with those -- maybe some magnitude around those?\n\n---\n\nYes. I think I said when I was going through it ...\n\n---\n\nI'm sorry, if you said it, then don't worry about it. I'll look it up. I missed it then. Not a big deal. I don't want to waste any of your time.\n\n---\n\nJust quick comments on just the Aerospace, in particular on the aftermarket side. It seems like that's kind of a conservative outlook just given that I audit that with a forecast for '15 of 7% growth for this year. Traffic is coming in at close to 6%. I wonder if you could just tease that out a little bit. And also on Repair & Overhaul growth recovering, following the kind of the Q3 trends that were negative.\n\n---\n\nI mean, I think that we're going to -- if you look at -- first, if you look at ATR, and we said the flight hours will be roughly flat, I mean, going to 4.5% growth rate. In our -- the thing you have to keep in mind is the installed base is a bit newer these days with a significant OE build-out, and those tend to be under warranty. And so that direct correlation to the aftermarket growth isn't always applicable in a period of a build-out like that. But with that, we're going to see good growth on both spares and R&O spares in particular. So should be up mid single digit on the spare side. R&O not quite as high, and that's on the ATR side on BGA. Similar trends, we'll see good mid single digits between spares and R&O for -- or R&O for BGA.\n\n---\n\nAnd any differences that you've seen just, I guess, geography-wise in terms of overall spares demand as we're going forward? Or just anything that you could call out there?\n\n---\n\nI think, I mean, from a spares perspective, good growth everywhere. I'd highlight APAC and EMEA on the ATR side. From a BGA perspective, it's the same thing, EMEA and APAC. And when I say EMEA, I'm including the Middle East. They're pretty strong for us in both cases on the spares side. R&O, pretty much similar across-the-board, nothing that stands out. And maybe a little bit more in the Americas, but -- on the BGA side. But other than that, it's been -- it's consistent with the composite growth rate I mentioned.\n\n---\n\nI would just maybe add, Tom, that the U.S. had pretty significant growth in spares in ACR in 2014. So that is going to look to moderate. But as Tom said, it's offset by some uptick in R&O.\n\n---\n\nTalk about legacy liabilities for a moment. Tom, you've done a nice job of moderating them. Where do you see them going? And what other initiatives do you have underway to put those behind you?\n\n---\n\nYes. I mean, when you look at environmental year-over-year, it'll be -- most of the -- those below-the-line items, between environmental and asbestos, it will be flat -- flattish, slightly down. So we're not going to see any one, single, large decrement in any given year. I think you're going to see us continue to manage those areas such that we experience a gradual decline.\n\n---\n\nAnd that's on the P&L, right?\n\n---\n\nRight. P&L line.\n\n---\n\nAnd cash as well? Is that the same way? Or I mean, you seem to have been able to put off some of the funding for the trust or manage it very effectively. Could you just elaborate there for a moment?\n\n---\n\nYes, I would say that the -- we've had very little 2014 in terms of expenditures relating to the trust. It's still in that formation, infancy stage. And there continue to be some delays in getting it operational. So at some point, you're going to see the cash flows from that NARCO piece jump off. We've planned for more in 2015 on NARCO side, but it's still manageable and within the balance of the $4.4 billion that we mentioned.\n\n---\n\nAnd then most of your cash continues to be overseas. How are you thinking about managing that relative to what you expect either in terms of taxes or in terms of funding acquisitions?\n\n---\n\nYes. Well, certainly, we -- there is no intention to, at this current point, to repatriate any of our foreign earnings under the current U.S. tax system. And there's not a lot we can do on that front. We stay active in just monitoring legislation. We are all for a comprehensive tax reform, one that allows for free mobility of capital by U.S. businesses so -- and we're not counting on anything rather than what we have today. We're not counting on any kind of onetime repatriation, for example. So what we do, do is we do 2 things. One is, from a tax-planning perspective, we try and move as much of that foreign cash in the U.S. on a tax-effective basis as is possible. Our tax team and the businesses have that front and center, and we strive to move cash on a regular basis. It's a -- they're modest amounts. I mean, they're less than $0.5 billion in any given year, but there's a lot of activity around that. And of course, we talked about M&A earlier. Certainly, one of our priorities would be to deploy that overseas cash in a way that enables us to take advantage of it from an M&A perspective.\n\n---\n\nI appreciate that. And then, last, to go back to the $184 million. If there's some way that you might be able to help us understand the -- either the competitive dynamic that you achieved by doing this or maybe the potential business revenues that you captured as a consequence of making these investments.\n\n---\n\nYes. I mean, the most important benefit from the whole thing, Howard, is the continued wins with our OEM customers, both on the ATR and BGA side. Beyond that, we don't talk about specific returns. And I would also think of this one as timing of some milestones that we're accelerating. And we've been able to find a way to take into account and offset the acceleration with the BEAV gains as we talked about. So the Five-Year -- overall Five-Year Plan, we're highly confident, and this really helps us to manage the level of OEM incentives over that 5-year time frame, in particular in 2016 and '17.\n\n---\n\nYes. [indiscernible].\n\n---\n\nJust a couple cleanup questions here, the first is on the currency hedging. Tom, you said it's 50% of Transportation Systems. Are -- where are the offsets for those hedges? Will that be in corporate? And will you call those out?\n\n---\n\nThe offsets -- well, first of all, just to make sure we're on the same page on the 50%. It's 50% of Honeywell's total exposure to the euro, which is all in Transportation Systems. So the impact that you will see from the -- from both the currency depreciation and the offsetting hedge will be in the Transportation Systems business.\n\n---\n\nAnd how do you pick 50% as the right number just given expectations for further strengthening of the dollar?\n\n---\n\nThat's a good question, Deane. When you look at the way we're diversified across Europe and other places outside the U.S., we've got quite a number of locations, each with their own exposure. The largest and most concentrated exposure for us was in Transportation Systems. So it was easy -- easier for us to get at an aggregate chunk of exposure and address it quickly. That's not to say that we're not looking at the rest. So as we close out 2014, we could very well look at some further expansion of that.\n\n---\n\nAnd then just lastly, on CapEx. If I look back from a year ago, were there any projects that were either pushed out into 2015 or delayed? And then can you comment on expected ROIs? You bragged about some really pretty impressive ROIs in some of the projects in PMT. Could you update those too, please?\n\n---\n\nYes. Certainly, on the ROIs, they're well accretive to the Honeywell's ROI, I get to start by sharing that. Yes, most of the -- I'd say most of the projects are on schedule in UOP. We've got significant expenditures on -- in the hydro processing catalysts and in other catalysts side, and we've got significant processing -- or significant CapEx on the solstice molecules that we talked about. If there have been any delays, they've been minor and probably focused more on the solstice side than anything else, but they're manageable and there's no revenue at risk in any case on these.\n\n---\n\nJust a question on emerging markets. Your forecast shows slowing in China, yet you have acceleration in your high-growth region revenue. Could you just hit what are the high points that drive this acceleration in the face of slowing China?\n\n---\n\nYes, I mean, the -- for us, the growth in ACS -- we'll see good growth in China in ACS.\n\n---\n\nIn aggregate, maybe actually a little bit ahead on a full year basis in '15 than what we saw in 2014.\n\n---\n\nYes, right, exactly, yes. But overall, for China -- and I'd say we'll be high single digits. We're forecasting high single digits across the portfolio. It's probably a little less than that this year. And our growth has been a little bit diluted by some intentional movement of some capacity in Resins & Chemicals outside of China into other parts of Asia. So that's kind of diluted down the 2014 growth. In '15, like I said, high single digits. And I would say each of the businesses looks to be in that same range. No distinction between any of the SBGs, so Aero, ACS and PMT. Individual pieces of them have some puts and takes. But overall, pretty strong.\n\n---\n\nI got you. And just one more follow-up question. In terms of your forecast for oil for the year, do you have an explicit forecast that sort of goes into your model for the year?\n\n---\n\nWe're not in the business of forecasting oil. We tend to rely on what the external benchmarks would tell you. But no, I don't have a specific forecast for oil.\n\n---\n\nBut as we just look at -- what should I look at? The forward curve? Where should I look to get a sense of what are those you use to create the framework for 2015?\n\n---\n\nWell, in terms of the UOP and HPS businesses, Andrew, we're fully looking at the backlog. And as you know, the backlog in PMT in those 2 businesses is up at record levels. The order rates year-to-date have been in double digits and have continued through November and into December. So it's -- we're not trying to hold ourselves or index at all to oil. We're trying to be aware of it. We're trying to look at the backlog and understand where there could be impacts from oil. But like I said, there's been nothing that impacts this in the health of those portfolios in 2015 at this point.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Thank you. Appreciate everyone attending. Just want a reminder that we'll be around all day for everyone's questions.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Steven Winoker (Analysts)】\nJust a couple of questions here. First, the annual operating plan process, I guess, would have largely concluded, although I know it's iterative, maybe right in the middle of oil coming down. And the slide you provided is very helpful, but I'm a little confused in terms of your commentary. You said that we factored in the impact of low oil prices, but you also talked about how there really isn't much impact at all this year anyway. So how did that kind of play out in terms of your bottom-up assessment of the impact?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Thomas Szlosek (Executives)】\nYes, Steve, the most direct impact is on the Resins & Chemicals business. As you know, the inputs to that business are -- the cost inputs of that business are highly correlated to oil. And the contracts in that business, a large portion of the contracts in that business, have price adjustments for the raw material inputs. So you end up seeing an impact on the top line. But what really had served us well is that the way the adjustments work and the way the formulas work, the operating income itself is generally preserved. So that's the major impact that we've reflected. By the way, Steve, that's -- sales-wise, that's probably $115 million or so.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Steven Winoker (Analysts)】\nOkay. Well, if you're giving me the sales -- and then what would the bottom line impact be?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Thomas Szlosek (Executives)】\nWell, I mean, we don't disclose the profit in those individual segments. But it would be -- it would not be impacted materially in any way by the price of the oil.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Steven Winoker (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then another point on that slide, you talked about the downstream, basically positive impact. But how are you guys talking about things like the $32 billion Petronas project that was canceled in Canada or deferred. Some of those activities and actions, internally are you guys looking at that and just saying that's a one-off and actually this is still going to be more positive for us downstream?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Thomas Szlosek (Executives)】\nYes, well, I mean, first of all, we were not a participant on that Petronas project. And -- but we continually assess the impact of oil on our backlog in both HPS and UOP. And as I said and I've tried to emphasize, not seeing anything in terms of delays or cancellations relating to the oil. And actually, some of those projects, like on the LNG side, they continue to provide some future order growth opportunity that we're pretty excited about.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Steven Winoker (Analysts)】\nOkay, all right. And maybe I'll just sneak one in before I hand off, but just on the capital deployment front, you talk about share count flat for 2014 levels. You've obviously got peak year on CapEx as you mentioned. But are you -- is the -- the M&A side, you now have been -- Roger has been at it for a little while now. Is part of your thinking on the buyback side kind of placeholder for M&A? And is that driving that commentary around just holding buybacks flat? Or is there something more at this point?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Thomas Szlosek (Executives)】\nYes. Well, if you recall, back with our Five-Year Plan that we went through in March, our intention is that, from an overall capital deployment perspective is to return about half of the cash flow that we generate to shareowners in the form of dividends and share buybacks with the share buybacks coming on an opportunistic basis, the dividends increasing faster than earnings, and you'll note that we increased our dividends in the fourth quarter by 15%. So it should be a good signal for what our expectations are going forward on earnings. As far as the other half of the capital deployment, we reinvest that in the business. You know the piece that's --  the CapEx piece, and we've talked about the $10 billion in M&A. And so over the 5 years, we do expect to deploy that capital, and it could even [ph] be more. But we're -- we have a pipeline. It's active as you mentioned. Starting in April of this year, Roger in his Vice Chairman role, one of his primary responsibilities now is M&A and really trying to engage the other SBGs the way he did it in ACS, and we're starting to see an impact. I mean, the pipelines are pretty strong, and the organization, we've actually doubled down on our resources in the M&A organization itself. So while I can't share any specific details, we do feel like we're making good progress there.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Joseph Ritchie (Analysts)】\nSo Tom, really helpful to get that oil and gas slide in there. Just a question, it seems like you've got some good visibility on your 2015 growth. But how do you think about what's in your backlog today for '16 and beyond? And is there any risk from prior history that anything in your backlog today gets repriced or revalued?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Thomas Szlosek (Executives)】\nYes. I mean, when you look at the more significant parts of our backlog, I talked about UOP and HPS. And I feel like the -- we're largely intact there, as I said. We're not seeing much of an impact. I mentioned that the Defense & Space backlog is actually up 8% since the beginning of the year, and that is a reflection of the nice progress the team has had in international, in particular. And then in terms of ACS, it's holding intact. So I feel like the 2015 is well positioned. As you know, the backlog diffusion varies by business in terms of when we actually see the impacts in subsequent periods. I mean, for example, Aerospace backlogs tend to show up in the P&L a little bit longer period -- over a longer period than, say, UOP and HPS. But the patterns that we've experienced in the past in terms of the expectations has not changed at all. So we think we're still in a similar mode.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Joseph Ritchie (Analysts)】\nBut I guess, just specifically, as it relates to UOP or in PMT, is there any risk that, that backlog gets repriced?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Thomas Szlosek (Executives)】\nI guess there could be a risk of that. But when you consider the positioning of where we are, when you look at where the exposure in that portfolio is, we have very little in terms of the upstream. And a lot of the upstream pressure that we're seeing on the oil prices is showing up in the higher-cost producers that have -- that are highly leveraged. And so we don't have very much in terms of exposure to that space. And as I said, where we are exposed in that space, we feel like the customer base is well capitalized and has a strong cost position. When you look at the significant -- the more significant part of the portfolio or the majority of the portfolio is in mid and downstream. And you could see how refiners are doing. You could see how petrochemical facilities are doing. It's boding well so far. And past -- our past experience, we've looked at this a little bit, and the PMT team is confident that this is an overall positive on that front.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Joseph Ritchie (Analysts)】\nOkay. And maybe if I could sneak one more in on the margins, it seems like nice step-up in margins on the PMT business this year. You've got a tailwind from price/raw mix and then also the facilities coming online. Is there any chance you can give us a little bit more detail on how much of an impact you're getting from price/raw in '15?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Thomas Szlosek (Executives)】\nYes, I would say the -- when you look at -- I mean, as you know, in Resins & Chemicals and in floorings, we've experienced some pressures from price/raws significantly, that moderates in 2015. I don't want to put an exact number on it, but range-wise, it will provide modest improvement in the margin rates in PMT.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Elena Doom (Executives)】\nIs it fair, Tom, to say off of the reported conversion rate, that it would be implied in the guidance as higher because of the impacts from the lower sales in R&C related to oil?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Thomas Szlosek (Executives)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Elena Doom (Executives)】\nSo if you the stretch that out, the conversion rate would be probably in that 35% range.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Thomas Szlosek (Executives)】\nAnd when you consider that and the FX and the Aero OEM, yes, that -- the conversion works exactly like we thought, yes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Davis (Analysts)】\nI'm glad you're confident on oil and gas because the rest of us are a little nervous, so hopefully you're right. But is there a point though -- did you stress test the impact of $50 oil versus $58 or $45 oil? I mean, is there a point where your PMT guys say, okay, bets are all off, like there's going to be a bigger impact here?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Thomas Szlosek (Executives)】\nYes, I mean, we have stress tested. We feel like between -- down to about $50, the 2015 plan, including all the backlog that we have, should be good. We're not, in this fourth quarter, we're not seeing any change to the expected order growth rates despite the prices that we've seen, Scott. So right now, between stress testing and the current -- the most current business, we feel like it's manageable.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Davis (Analysts)】\nOkay. I won't beat the dead horse. And then the one thing I thought was a little surprising when I saw the slide is that you expect your share count to be flat. With the cash you're generating, the balance sheet base you have, I would have thought, if you believe this guidance, your stock is pretty darn cheap. I mean, what's the -- I guess -- again getting to thresholds, I mean, what is the point on a stock price or a correction in the S&P that you start to say, hey, we need to change the plan here? Or is just share buybacks off the table completely?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Thomas Szlosek (Executives)】\nYes, I think the way we're talking about deploying the capital, Scott, is not inconsistent with what we said in the Five-Year Plan, and we feel like the best returns that we can generate and provide right now are on the M&A side and our models for the deals that we're looking at continue to support that. And I would say that if there's -- if we go by a significant period of time and we haven't seen activity that supports that $10 billion run rate over the 5-year basis, maybe you'd see us take a different tack. But kind of right now, Dave's view is that's the direction he wants to go in.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Davis (Analysts)】\nOkay, fair enough. And then just quickly, I'll sneak one in. I mean, when you talk about the margin tailwind, which has really been a great story for you guys for quite some time now, but what -- is it possible to separate at the impact of HOS and what impact that has directly on margins? And what I mean is not HOS necessarily holistically, but the rate of change in gold versus Silver and silver versus bronze year-over-year. Is that possible to think about that now?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Thomas Szlosek (Executives)】\nI mean, it's a little bit tough. The productivity that comes just in the supply chain itself tends to be around conversion costs as well as in areas like cost of poor quality, so warranty, defects, rework, scrap. And so we can look at those individual categories. But I'd say, overall, you have to look at the confluence of the impacts from OEF, the impacts from Functional Transformation, impacts from HOS Gold is all showing up in restructuring. Because when we undertake all those activities I mentioned, it has a need for -- significant need for exit costs, and you see us with a continued pipeline of restructuring activities. The other place that you see it is in our cost productivity on materials. So between those 2 areas, between the purchase -- outside purchase costs, whether it's direct or indirect, as well on the people costs, that's where the productivity is showing up. We don't isolate it to just HOS Gold. It comes from all the factors I mentioned.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Nigel Coe (Analysts)】\nSo just want to spin back to 4Q -- just want to tick a box on 4Q. $0.03 coming in line with the plan, but any puts and takes either by geography or by business to call out, Tom?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Thomas Szlosek (Executives)】\nNothing significant other than the -- there's a little bit of that Resins & Chemicals impact in the fourth quarter as you would expect. But we've got other offsets in other parts of the portfolio. So net-net, not a significant difference from what we would have shared in October.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Nigel Coe (Analysts)】\nOkay, that's helpful. And then the 9% -- sorry, the high single-digit outlook for UOP, I guess, mid- to high single digits at UOP. I think you said 9% actually growth for next year. That's right, correct, Tom?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Thomas Szlosek (Executives)】\nThink I said 9%. Did I?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Elena Doom (Executives)】\nI think we said towards high single digit.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Thomas Szlosek (Executives)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Nigel Coe (Analysts)】\nHigh single digit, okay. Is there any change in what's driving that? You talk about the catalyst capacity ramp. Is that primarily driven by catalyst reload? So is it a bit more balanced than that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Thomas Szlosek (Executives)】\nYes, I mean, I think it's balanced across the portfolio, to be honest with you. I mean, when you look at the gas processing business, really healthy backlog there. Catalyst backlog is strong as well. And even on the equipment side, the PTU side, all parts of that UOP portfolio are performing well.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Nigel Coe (Analysts)】\nOkay, okay. And then just a final one on, I guess, on pension. You put in the new mortality schedules. I think you were one of the first ones, I think that was probably last year. Obviously, we've had an update on that. Any impact from that, Tom?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Thomas Szlosek (Executives)】\nSo let me just be clear on that, Nigel, because what we did in the -- it was 2013 was we adopted the BB Scale of the existing mortality table, for what that's worth. And that was -- the impact on that was about $0.5 billion on PBO. We don't think very many of our peers have done that. And then the next requirement is, as you say, to adopt the new mortality tables. That likely will be required in 2016. And when we do that, we're expecting another $0.5 billion impact on PBO barring any types of changes that we would make in the benefits.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Nigel Coe (Analysts)】\nAnd right now, would you expect that to have a P&L impact or a cash impact?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Thomas Szlosek (Executives)】\nIt shouldn't have a cash impact. And from a P&L perspective...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Elena Doom (Executives)】\nYes, it's going to be -- with the quarter capacity that we have in the U.S. on the MTM piece, it would have likely no impact.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jeffrey Sprague (Analysts)】\nJust a couple quick things. Tom, on CapEx, can you actually give us the dollar number and how much you expect it to decline in '16 given that '15 is the top here?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Thomas Szlosek (Executives)】\nYes, I guess I'd put it in the range of our history, Jeff. We've generally been in the $800 million to $900 million range before we started ramping up. We'll get to about $1.3 billion in 2015. So I would say somewhere between those 2 endpoints is where I would expect to see it on an ongoing basis.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jeffrey Sprague (Analysts)】\nSo you won't get down that far in '16. No, you're not saying...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Thomas Szlosek (Executives)】\nNo, no, no. Yes, '15 and '16 will be -- still be -- it'll be $1.1 billion in '14, probably $1.3 billion in '15. '16 will come down a little bit but not materially. Then you start to see it in 2017 and beyond.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jeffrey Sprague (Analysts)】\nIs R&D up in 2015 in dollars or percent of sales?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Thomas Szlosek (Executives)】\nAs a percentage of sales, it will be slightly up. We're still around that 5%, call it, 4.9% for 2014, 5.1% for 2015.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jeffrey Sprague (Analysts)】\nOkay. Then just a couple quick ones. All else being equal, doesn't the formula pricing of $115 million revenue impact kind of explain all the margin improvement in PMT? I mean, I know all else isn't equal, really. There's a lot moving on, but you got $115 million revenue impact and a little to no associated profit impact. Looks like over 100 bps of margin.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Elena Doom (Executives)】\nThere's margin expansion across the entire portfolio, Jeff, in 2015. So UOP -- remember, UOP margins were down in 2014, so they get a nice lift in 2015. Process Solutions really drove all of the margin improvement in 2014 for PMT. So you see that benefit continues but not at the same pace in '15 for Process. And in Advanced Materials, again, margins were down as you alluded to, primarily due to the price/raws headwinds we had in R&C and in flooring Products. [indiscernible] So you see some benefits in '15, but if you looked at the segments independently, UOP would be the biggest contributor.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jeffrey Sprague (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then just one quick one, just back to kind of a share repurchase question. In October, the stock spent a couple weeks in the 80s and actually hit a 52-week low. I mean, did that entice any interest in stepping up a little bit on repo?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Thomas Szlosek (Executives)】\nYes, like I said, we didn't really view that as the most effective way of using our capital even at that time. Of course, we look at the share price every day, and we take it into account. We're not ignoring it blindly, but we're looking at it from a long-term basis.\n\n---\n\n【質問: C. Stephen Tusa (Analysts)】\nCan you -- I know you guys threw out a bunch of program numbers or programs on the Aerospace side that the charge was applicable to. Can you maybe give a little bit more detail on what were some of the bigger programs represented in the charge? And also, what stage these programs are on if they were -- been -- if they were recently awarded business or programs that have been going on for a while.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Thomas Szlosek (Executives)】\nYes. Well, I mean, we're not in a position really to talk about the individual commercial arrangements. But the programs that I did mention are contributing significant value to the portfolio, both in the next 5 years as well as the ensuing, call it, 20- to 30-year service period. And the $184 million, that gives us a nice lift, particularly in 2016 and 2017 when these incentives would have been peaking. And so we've been able to accelerate those into 2014, such that over that 5-year period, the year-to-year impact from the OEM incentives would be minimized.\n\n---\n\n【質問: C. Stephen Tusa (Analysts)】\nI got it. So there was a -- there's kind of a timing element here where you kind of chose to take these offsets?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Thomas Szlosek (Executives)】\nYes. And it's -- just to emphasize, it has very little impact on 2015. This is more of a Five-Year Plan kind of thing.\n\n---\n\n【質問: C. Stephen Tusa (Analysts)】\nBut again, this wasn't something that, hey, came up in fourth quarter and you go in and sell some stock. I mean, this is a kind of planned, opportunistic type of dynamic is what I'm hearing?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Thomas Szlosek (Executives)】\nYes, I mean, it is -- the amounts become due as our customers reach certain milestones. So the milestone could be the delivery of a drawing or the achievement of certain production volumes or something that's certified by the customer that then necessitates us to be obligated to make the payments. So that's how it works, and a number of those milestones were attained in the fourth quarter.\n\n---\n\n【質問: C. Stephen Tusa (Analysts)】\nGot it. And is this a new development? I mean, obviously, Boeing has talked a lot about partnering for success. And is this -- without that, would there still be these types of incentive payments?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Thomas Szlosek (Executives)】\nNo. I would say, Steve, that all of our OEMs have their own moniker that they apply to their productivity initiatives with their suppliers. And the model that we're describing is very, very consistent with the way we've done business with all of them in the past and continue to do so going forward.\n\n---\n\n【質問: C. Stephen Tusa (Analysts)】\nRight. I'm sure you guys have a different moniker. One last question, on Slide 13, below-the-line stable pension upside offset by restructuring, any real change there with those -- maybe some magnitude around those?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Thomas Szlosek (Executives)】\nYes. I think I said when I was going through it ...\n\n---\n\n【質問: C. Stephen Tusa (Analysts)】\nI'm sorry, if you said it, then don't worry about it. I'll look it up. I missed it then. Not a big deal. I don't want to waste any of your time.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Peter Arment (Analysts)】\nJust quick comments on just the Aerospace, in particular on the aftermarket side. It seems like that's kind of a conservative outlook just given that I audit that with a forecast for '15 of 7% growth for this year. Traffic is coming in at close to 6%. I wonder if you could just tease that out a little bit. And also on Repair & Overhaul growth recovering, following the kind of the Q3 trends that were negative.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Thomas Szlosek (Executives)】\nI mean, I think that we're going to -- if you look at -- first, if you look at ATR, and we said the flight hours will be roughly flat, I mean, going to 4.5% growth rate. In our -- the thing you have to keep in mind is the installed base is a bit newer these days with a significant OE build-out, and those tend to be under warranty. And so that direct correlation to the aftermarket growth isn't always applicable in a period of a build-out like that. But with that, we're going to see good growth on both spares and R&O spares in particular. So should be up mid single digit on the spare side. R&O not quite as high, and that's on the ATR side on BGA. Similar trends, we'll see good mid single digits between spares and R&O for -- or R&O for BGA.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Peter Arment (Analysts)】\nAnd any differences that you've seen just, I guess, geography-wise in terms of overall spares demand as we're going forward? Or just anything that you could call out there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Thomas Szlosek (Executives)】\nI think, I mean, from a spares perspective, good growth everywhere. I'd highlight APAC and EMEA on the ATR side. From a BGA perspective, it's the same thing, EMEA and APAC. And when I say EMEA, I'm including the Middle East. They're pretty strong for us in both cases on the spares side. R&O, pretty much similar across-the-board, nothing that stands out. And maybe a little bit more in the Americas, but -- on the BGA side. But other than that, it's been -- it's consistent with the composite growth rate I mentioned.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Elena Doom (Executives)】\nI would just maybe add, Tom, that the U.S. had pretty significant growth in spares in ACR in 2014. So that is going to look to moderate. But as Tom said, it's offset by some uptick in R&O.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Howard Rubel (Analysts)】\nTalk about legacy liabilities for a moment. Tom, you've done a nice job of moderating them. Where do you see them going? And what other initiatives do you have underway to put those behind you?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Thomas Szlosek (Executives)】\nYes. I mean, when you look at environmental year-over-year, it'll be -- most of the -- those below-the-line items, between environmental and asbestos, it will be flat -- flattish, slightly down. So we're not going to see any one, single, large decrement in any given year. I think you're going to see us continue to manage those areas such that we experience a gradual decline.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Elena Doom (Executives)】\nAnd that's on the P&L, right?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Thomas Szlosek (Executives)】\nRight. P&L line.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Howard Rubel (Analysts)】\nAnd cash as well? Is that the same way? Or I mean, you seem to have been able to put off some of the funding for the trust or manage it very effectively. Could you just elaborate there for a moment?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Thomas Szlosek (Executives)】\nYes, I would say that the -- we've had very little 2014 in terms of expenditures relating to the trust. It's still in that formation, infancy stage. And there continue to be some delays in getting it operational. So at some point, you're going to see the cash flows from that NARCO piece jump off. We've planned for more in 2015 on NARCO side, but it's still manageable and within the balance of the $4.4 billion that we mentioned.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Howard Rubel (Analysts)】\nAnd then most of your cash continues to be overseas. How are you thinking about managing that relative to what you expect either in terms of taxes or in terms of funding acquisitions?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Thomas Szlosek (Executives)】\nYes. Well, certainly, we -- there is no intention to, at this current point, to repatriate any of our foreign earnings under the current U.S. tax system. And there's not a lot we can do on that front. We stay active in just monitoring legislation. We are all for a comprehensive tax reform, one that allows for free mobility of capital by U.S. businesses so -- and we're not counting on anything rather than what we have today. We're not counting on any kind of onetime repatriation, for example. So what we do, do is we do 2 things. One is, from a tax-planning perspective, we try and move as much of that foreign cash in the U.S. on a tax-effective basis as is possible. Our tax team and the businesses have that front and center, and we strive to move cash on a regular basis. It's a -- they're modest amounts. I mean, they're less than $0.5 billion in any given year, but there's a lot of activity around that. And of course, we talked about M&A earlier. Certainly, one of our priorities would be to deploy that overseas cash in a way that enables us to take advantage of it from an M&A perspective.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Howard Rubel (Analysts)】\nI appreciate that. And then, last, to go back to the $184 million. If there's some way that you might be able to help us understand the -- either the competitive dynamic that you achieved by doing this or maybe the potential business revenues that you captured as a consequence of making these investments.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Thomas Szlosek (Executives)】\nYes. I mean, the most important benefit from the whole thing, Howard, is the continued wins with our OEM customers, both on the ATR and BGA side. Beyond that, we don't talk about specific returns. And I would also think of this one as timing of some milestones that we're accelerating. And we've been able to find a way to take into account and offset the acceleration with the BEAV gains as we talked about. So the Five-Year -- overall Five-Year Plan, we're highly confident, and this really helps us to manage the level of OEM incentives over that 5-year time frame, in particular in 2016 and '17.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Elena Doom (Executives)】\nYes. [indiscernible].\n\n---\n\n【質問: Deane Dray (Analysts)】\nJust a couple cleanup questions here, the first is on the currency hedging. Tom, you said it's 50% of Transportation Systems. Are -- where are the offsets for those hedges? Will that be in corporate? And will you call those out?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Thomas Szlosek (Executives)】\nThe offsets -- well, first of all, just to make sure we're on the same page on the 50%. It's 50% of Honeywell's total exposure to the euro, which is all in Transportation Systems. So the impact that you will see from the -- from both the currency depreciation and the offsetting hedge will be in the Transportation Systems business.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Deane Dray (Analysts)】\nAnd how do you pick 50% as the right number just given expectations for further strengthening of the dollar?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Thomas Szlosek (Executives)】\nThat's a good question, Deane. When you look at the way we're diversified across Europe and other places outside the U.S., we've got quite a number of locations, each with their own exposure. The largest and most concentrated exposure for us was in Transportation Systems. So it was easy -- easier for us to get at an aggregate chunk of exposure and address it quickly. That's not to say that we're not looking at the rest. So as we close out 2014, we could very well look at some further expansion of that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Deane Dray (Analysts)】\nAnd then just lastly, on CapEx. If I look back from a year ago, were there any projects that were either pushed out into 2015 or delayed? And then can you comment on expected ROIs? You bragged about some really pretty impressive ROIs in some of the projects in PMT. Could you update those too, please?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Thomas Szlosek (Executives)】\nYes. Certainly, on the ROIs, they're well accretive to the Honeywell's ROI, I get to start by sharing that. Yes, most of the -- I'd say most of the projects are on schedule in UOP. We've got significant expenditures on -- in the hydro processing catalysts and in other catalysts side, and we've got significant processing -- or significant CapEx on the solstice molecules that we talked about. If there have been any delays, they've been minor and probably focused more on the solstice side than anything else, but they're manageable and there's no revenue at risk in any case on these.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Obin (Analysts)】\nJust a question on emerging markets. Your forecast shows slowing in China, yet you have acceleration in your high-growth region revenue. Could you just hit what are the high points that drive this acceleration in the face of slowing China?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Thomas Szlosek (Executives)】\nYes, I mean, the -- for us, the growth in ACS -- we'll see good growth in China in ACS.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Elena Doom (Executives)】\nIn aggregate, maybe actually a little bit ahead on a full year basis in '15 than what we saw in 2014.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Thomas Szlosek (Executives)】\nYes, right, exactly, yes. But overall, for China -- and I'd say we'll be high single digits. We're forecasting high single digits across the portfolio. It's probably a little less than that this year. And our growth has been a little bit diluted by some intentional movement of some capacity in Resins & Chemicals outside of China into other parts of Asia. So that's kind of diluted down the 2014 growth. In '15, like I said, high single digits. And I would say each of the businesses looks to be in that same range. No distinction between any of the SBGs, so Aero, ACS and PMT. Individual pieces of them have some puts and takes. But overall, pretty strong.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Obin (Analysts)】\nI got you. And just one more follow-up question. In terms of your forecast for oil for the year, do you have an explicit forecast that sort of goes into your model for the year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Thomas Szlosek (Executives)】\nWe're not in the business of forecasting oil. We tend to rely on what the external benchmarks would tell you. But no, I don't have a specific forecast for oil.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Obin (Analysts)】\nBut as we just look at -- what should I look at? The forward curve? Where should I look to get a sense of what are those you use to create the framework for 2015?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Thomas Szlosek (Executives)】\nWell, in terms of the UOP and HPS businesses, Andrew, we're fully looking at the backlog. And as you know, the backlog in PMT in those 2 businesses is up at record levels. The order rates year-to-date have been in double digits and have continued through November and into December. So it's -- we're not trying to hold ourselves or index at all to oil. We're trying to be aware of it. We're trying to look at the backlog and understand where there could be impacts from oil. But like I said, there's been nothing that impacts this in the health of those portfolios in 2015 at this point.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Macaluso (Executives)】\nOkay. Thank you. Appreciate everyone attending. Just want a reminder that we'll be around all day for everyone's questions.",

I'd like to provide more color to accompany the guidance data we provided the market earlier this afternoon. Working our way down the income statement for 2015, we plan to operate inside our 67% to 70% gross margin business model. We are guiding 68% for the year, an improvement from our experience in 2014. The dominant driver for the improvement is more favorable vertical mix versus 2014. We see strength in several sub-vertical markets, which carry higher than corporate average gross margins. By way of background across our 11 sub-verticals, we experience a wide range of gross margins, largely as a result of the differences in the volume at which customers purchase our FPGAs in a given vertical market. Despite the good growth of 2014, the vertical mix of that growth came with pressure to gross margins. We are forecasting a 2015 that has broader and more balanced growth across vertical markets and will therefore carry more typical gross margins. Gross margin will improve through fiscal 2015. \r\nWe're planning operating expenses to grow 2.7% to $760 million in 2015 from $740 million in 2014. R&D will increase 2.6% while SG&A will grow 2.8%. SG&A OpEx will be leveled through the year while R&D will be somewhat first half loaded. \r\nAs we articulated in November 2013, for the next several years, we're striving to increase revenue at a higher rate than OpEx allowing operating margin expansion. \r\nA few smaller items in passing. Net interest expense is likely to drop as we are repositioning our investment portfolio, thus generating an improved return. Our effective tax rate for 2015 should be 13% to 14% excluding any discrete items. \r\nFinally, as a result of sustained share repurchases, we see fewer shares outstanding. \r\nStepping back, you can see that we have tremendous operating leverage in our P&L moving into the 2015 fiscal year. Gross margin improvement of about 1 point, a very modest increase in OpEx, some savings and other expense and fewer diluted shares outstanding. \r\nFY '15 will be a year where percentage growth in revenue will create a much larger EPS percentage growth because of this operating leverage. \r\nWith respect to returning cash to shareholders. We are maintaining a 60% to 80% range of return of cash flow from operating activities in 2015 through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. On the repurchase side, we will exit 2014 with funds remaining from $1 billion in debt we raised toward the end of 2013. We'd expect to use those remaining funds in the early part of 2015. \r\nWith respect to the dividend, which is a regular and significant portion of the return of cash, we remain committed to increasing it over time. \r\nWith that, let me turn the call over to John.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Ron. FPGAs remain well positioned to grow in the years ahead. Rising development costs are limiting the role for fixed function custom ASICs and ASSPs. Simultaneously, Altera FPGAs, staying on Moore's Law, have become more feature-rich with improved performance and lower cost per unit of logic. For customers in infrastructure markets, with the need to create differentiated systems, FPGAs have become more and more essential. At the same time, there is an emerging role for FPGAs as hardware accelerators that offers an additional growth avenue for us. As data centers are deployed in support of cloud computing, Big Data analytics, search and other high-performance computing applications, operators are faced with the challenge of providing a higher performance compute capability yet doing so within an acceptable power budget. The massively parallel structure of FPGAs offers a solution with fast performance, low power and flexibility. Now with the arrival of OpenCL, a software platform easily used by software engineers to target FPGAs as coprocessors, Altera has uniquely removed the biggest engineering barrier to wide-scale adoption of our FPGAs in these acceleration roles. We estimate the accelerator market as a $1 billion TAM by decade's end. \r\nOur mid-range Arria 10 family and our high-end 14-nanometer FinFET Stratix 10 family are doing very well. Arria 10 is sampling now and has best-in-class performance. Stratix 10, with a new high-performance HyperFlex architecture, is in the software early access phase. Here, Stratix 10 customers have the ability to see for themselves the 2x performance, 4x logic boost and reduced power consumption of this high-end family that will begin shipping in 2015. A record opportunity pipe exists for both families. Additionally, we have identified more than a $0.5 billion of new Stratix 10 opportunities in the telecom and wireless space that previously was beyond the reach due to size, speed, power limitations. \r\nStepping back a bit, the R&D investments over the last few years are varied and potent. OpenCL, as I just mentioned, to speed the penetration of our FPGAs as hardware accelerators; plus HyperFlex, our new high-performance, high-density FPGA fabric; plus embedded microprocessors as an option across nearly all of our FPGAs; plus the industry's only FPGA with hardened, embedded, floating-point engine to address the most challenging higher end computational needs; plus the world's first 14-nanometer FinFET based FPGA; plus a new ultra low-end FPGA family in MAX 10; and much more. All of these capabilities are now in place, allowing us to slow the rate of growth of R&D in the coming years, not just in 2015, so that we can benefit from an extended period of operating leverage. \r\nWe emerge from 2014 in an excellent position to take advantage of these R&D investments. We aim to show further FPGA market share gains while we expand the reach of FPGA technology, which together produce better than semi-industry growth and profitability. \r\nLet me now turn the call back to Scott.\n\n---\n\nWe would now like to take questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, would you please provide instructions and poll for questions?",

[Operator Instructions] Operator, would you please provide instructions and poll for questions?",
      "transcript_text3": "What is the implied 2015 top line that you're baking in, in your planning? That is my first question.\n\n---\n\nSorry, as is usual, and we've done this for, I don't know, 10-plus years, we do not provide the top line guidance for the following year. We take it at a quarter at a time. And we're also not in a position to break down any vertical for next year as well. As Ron mentioned, we do expect to grow in 2015. We do expect a majority of our vertical markets to grow. As is always the case in the programmable logic industry, long-term sales forecasting is challenging. Our customers exist in a very fluid world with sales growth profile subject to never-ending revision. As such, we just are going to be consistent with what we've done in the past and provide 1 quarter only at a time guidance for the verticals and for overall revenue guidance. Thank you very much.\n\n---\n\nJohn, I was going to ask for your outlook on telecom and wireless next year. But I guess, I'll just -- I guess, I'll ask on gross margin, the improvement next year, given that it's principally driven by mix, how can you, I guess, how can you predict your mix given some of the same constraints you're having with predicting revenue?\n\n---\n\nWhat we do is it is based on a plan that we do. We know, inherently, that there is going to be inaccuracy within the plan and that's generally why Ron provides a range. There are some years where we go over that range. There are some years where we've been under. This year's been one of the ones that we've been under because, again, we called the mix wrong a year early. But we do try to put out together a model based on the best that we know. And do provide a range to provide some error bar around that and generally, that's been for us fairly accurate on at least the gross margin line. I don't know if you have any other comments.\n\n---\n\nNo, I mean, I think that's well said. Obviously, mix was a challenge this year. We talked about that through the year. We've told you over time that you'll see other verticals grow and that's what we expect to happen last -- next year.\n\n---\n\nJohn, I guess, I want to talk a little bit more about the R&D line. I wonder if you could just help me out to better understand what percent of R&D is going to pure process technology versus other things like software development to get -- open up new markets. And as we think about the portion which is process technology related, is next year kind of a softer year of spend there because '14 is mostly behind us? And then we think again in 2016, around 10-nanometer, how do we think about that cadence from the R&D line?\n\n---\n\nYes. I think if you go back maybe 10, 15 years ago, we used to have an oscillation in R&D where 1 year, we would have a lot of tapeouts and then perhaps the following year, we wouldn't. And so there'd be a big up or down component within the R&D spending. I think what you've seen over the last 4 or 5 years is because we're developing so many product lines in parallel, now we have tapeouts consistently or constantly. And so there's not as much oscillation, I would say, within mask and wafer spend for R&D as there was in the past. There can be, but it's not a thing that drives our numbers necessarily one way or the other on a major, major basis. Really can't break down, at this point, the R&D, IP, mask and wafers, how many engineers that we have by hardware. No real metrics that I could give you at this point. Thank you very much.\n\n---\n\nJust a color on the -- a little bit more color on the interest expense line. Ron, you mentioned that it would be coming down. Can you go into a little bit more detail? Is there any sort of debt repayment that's happening? Is it refi? And any sort of magnitude would be helpful.\n\n---\n\nI want to stay at a high level here. It's just repositioning our portfolio. Obviously, we have a lot of cash, we're just repositioning some of that. It's no debt repayment. I just want to stay at that level for this time.\n\n---\n\nThank you very much.\n\n---\n\nI'm hoping to tack on to an earlier one about R&D and minds about CapEx. It seems to be coming down pretty significantly. Next year and relative to your comments a moment ago about the oscillation of spend being more moderate now. How does that fit in with CapEx seeming to dip meaningfully?\n\n---\n\nSo CapEx is going down a little bit. I think what I guided for this year, 2014 was $40 million. I think it will be around $30 million, $28 million to $30 million in 2015.\n\n---\n\nThe software licenses...\n\n---\n\nYes. It's really just software license. It has nothing to do with mask and wafers. That expense is part of the R&D expense.\n\n---\n\nYes. So what happens with the software agreements that we do with EDA vendors is we will typically do a 3-year license of their tools. And so in the year that we renew a contract, there will be a large CapEx charge associated with that, but really, it doesn't change the expense line much because it's amortized over a 3-year period. And so you've seen every few years, that one goes up and it's really because to a large extent, the major EDA contracts that we have for our own chip development are done usually all in the same year with all of the major vendors. So there hasn't been much, I would say, significant change there.\n\n---\n\nThis is Ryan Goodman. I wanted to talk a little bit about the cash balance and cash plan. You guys put out the forecast for 60% to 80% to gain cash return to dividends and buybacks but you came in at nearly double that, I think, this past year, at least quarter-to-date and the cash balance is still holding flattish or even up a little. So how should we be thinking about that going forward? Are you going to be strict to staying to 60% to 80%? Is there kind of a target cash balance that you're modeling around? Just any color you could add to that if there's room for upside to that in terms of how much you spend.\n\n---\n\nWell, to your point, yes. This year, we're well above that 60%, 80%, mainly because a year ago we did a public debt offering and this year, we'll repurchase probably 650 million to 700 million of shares with that debt. That isn't typical, but what I'd feel more comfortable on an ongoing basis representing, is that you should see 60% to 80%. And we basically did that in 2012 and 2011. 2013 -- 2014 is a banner year just because of the debt. Though we have, and still we generate a lot of U.S. cash, we generate a lot of total cash and we still have, over time, debt capacity.\n\n---\n\nThank you very much.\n\n---\n\nOn the server acceleration opportunity, obviously, it feels like it's a big dollar opportunity and data center is one of the fastest-growing markets within the IT hardware space. Does the team expect this segment to outgrow your overall business in 2015? And maybe if you can just help us understand, are the gross margins for these types of applications better than the corporate average?\n\n---\n\nSo I can't really comment specifically on the gross margins. Again, you can imagine that we do have many of our customers follow our financials and we'd like to stay away from those comments because they may come back in a negotiation. But ultimately, if you look at the computer area, we do expect it for the next several years to be one of the key growth drivers of the corporation. It's early innings in that. I think you've seen through some customer announcements that we've had, plus even Intel is announcing that they will combine, over time, FPGA technology with their processors that this clearly is a winning space for FPGAs. It's a new market. It's early. Therefore, we expect it to grow. Typically, customers in this space do use our highest-end FPGAs as well. So the revenue in ASPs are very strong. Thank you very much.\n\n---\n\nYour R&D, is [indiscernible] 13.5% and 10% to 22% this year, plus or minus. So what's the long-term model? And are you guys expecting -- usually, when you have a lot of quals [ph] and tapeouts, your R&D goes up. I'm just wondering how much of '14 is in nanometers in '15?\n\n---\n\nSo, Gust, our long term model for R&D is 19% to 21%. So we're a little above that this year. We're going to grow our way into -- as I said, growing revenue faster than R&D.\n\n---\n\nAnd as I mentioned a few moments ago, we do not see the oscillation as much as we did in prior years. I think it's probably been 8 to 10 years since we've seen that, that sort of significant oscillation within R&D associated with tapeouts. Really is a factor of the fact that we're doing so many products in parallel, we have a lot of tapeouts every year. And therefore -- and if you think about it, we're doing a lot of different families right now. So you've seen those introduced from us. So ultimately, it's a product of the R&D pipeline that we have that has evened out the mask and wafer spend. And as Ron said earlier, again, this is an area that we expense so these are not capitalized items. Thank you very much.\n\n---\n\nYes, John, I know you want to stay away from kind of the top line expectations for next year, but given sort of all the new application markets that you guys have kind of tried to exploit over the last several years, it sounds like some of them are going to come to fortune [ph] in '15. I'm just kind of curious of how we should think about your growth rate relative to the overall semi market. If you look at the data it's sort of mixed just to whether or not PLDs have actually outgrown ASICs/semis. Is next year on your mind or just end of year of outgrowth for Altera relative to kind of the overall broader semi market?\n\n---\n\nWell, I guess, what I could do is, John, is kind of put this in context of what we've seen in the past. So what we've seen in the past is Altera may not outgrow the end markets necessarily every year. But if you sort of take 3 or 5 years together, what you'll see through a cycle is that we will, on average, outgrow the non-memory portion of the semiconductor industry. And usually by about 2x. And that's been true over the last 5 years and it's generally been true over that entire period of time. And the reason I say we will not necessarily outperform every year is if you sort of get into the 2012, 2013 cycle, semiconductors was roughly flat as an industry, but more of the spending shifted from infrastructure in 2010, '11 to -- and '12 and '13, it was more focused on handsets. And obviously, we're an infrastructure player, not a handset player. So we underperformed in '12, '13. In '14, you saw the return of infrastructure spending again, not just in communications, but also certainly, in industrial and a number of the other segments. So we talked about the fact that we've got computers, a new growth area for us and I think overall, if you kind of look at 2014, we probably outperformed the non-memory portion of semiconductor industry by well over 2x. So yes, so I still think that's probably holds for us. To be honest, I haven't looked in detail at forecast for next year to compare what our plan is for -- versus other companies' forecast. So I really can't do it on a forward-looking basis. I can just use history and say that based on history, we would expect that to continue for us and that being the continued out-performance of the non-memory portion of the semiconductor industry on average. Thank you very much.\n\n---\n\nThank you, operator. This concludes Altera's conference call. Thanks for your interest and participation.",

Obviously, we have a lot of cash, we're just repositioning some of that. It's no debt repayment. I just want to stay at that level for this time.\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Daane (Executives)】\nThank you very much.\n\n---\n\n【質問: William Stein (Analysts)】\nI'm hoping to tack on to an earlier one about R&D and minds about CapEx. It seems to be coming down pretty significantly. Next year and relative to your comments a moment ago about the oscillation of spend being more moderate now. How does that fit in with CapEx seeming to dip meaningfully?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ronald Pasek (Executives)】\nSo CapEx is going down a little bit. I think what I guided for this year, 2014 was $40 million. I think it will be around $30 million, $28 million to $30 million in 2015.\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Daane (Executives)】\nThe software licenses...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ronald Pasek (Executives)】\nYes. It's really just software license. It has nothing to do with mask and wafers. That expense is part of the R&D expense.\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Daane (Executives)】\nYes. So what happens with the software agreements that we do with EDA vendors is we will typically do a 3-year license of their tools. And so in the year that we renew a contract, there will be a large CapEx charge associated with that, but really, it doesn't change the expense line much because it's amortized over a 3-year period. And so you've seen every few years, that one goes up and it's really because to a large extent, the major EDA contracts that we have for our own chip development are done usually all in the same year with all of the major vendors. So there hasn't been much, I would say, significant change there.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ryan Goodman (Analysts)】\nThis is Ryan Goodman. I wanted to talk a little bit about the cash balance and cash plan. You guys put out the forecast for 60% to 80% to gain cash return to dividends and buybacks but you came in at nearly double that, I think, this past year, at least quarter-to-date and the cash balance is still holding flattish or even up a little. So how should we be thinking about that going forward? Are you going to be strict to staying to 60% to 80%? Is there kind of a target cash balance that you're modeling around? Just any color you could add to that if there's room for upside to that in terms of how much you spend.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ronald Pasek (Executives)】\nWell, to your point, yes. This year, we're well above that 60%, 80%, mainly because a year ago we did a public debt offering and this year, we'll repurchase probably 650 million to 700 million of shares with that debt. That isn't typical, but what I'd feel more comfortable on an ongoing basis representing, is that you should see 60% to 80%. And we basically did that in 2012 and 2011. 2013 -- 2014 is a banner year just because of the debt. Though we have, and still we generate a lot of U.S. cash, we generate a lot of total cash and we still have, over time, debt capacity.\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Daane (Executives)】\nThank you very much.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Harlan Sur (Analysts)】\nOn the server acceleration opportunity, obviously, it feels like it's a big dollar opportunity and data center is one of the fastest-growing markets within the IT hardware space. Does the team expect this segment to outgrow your overall business in 2015? And maybe if you can just help us understand, are the gross margins for these types of applications better than the corporate average?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Daane (Executives)】\nSo I can't really comment specifically on the gross margins. Again, you can imagine that we do have many of our customers follow our financials and we'd like to stay away from those comments because they may come back in a negotiation. But ultimately, if you look at the computer area, we do expect it for the next several years to be one of the key growth drivers of the corporation. It's early innings in that. I think you've seen through some customer announcements that we've had, plus even Intel is announcing that they will combine, over time, FPGA technology with their processors that this clearly is a winning space for FPGAs. It's a new market. It's early. Therefore, we expect it to grow. Typically, customers in this space do use our highest-end FPGAs as well. So the revenue in ASPs are very strong. Thank you very much.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Auguste Richard (Analysts)】\nYour R&D, is [indiscernible] 13.5% and 10% to 22% this year, plus or minus. So what's the long-term model? And are you guys expecting -- usually, when you have a lot of quals [ph] and tapeouts, your R&D goes up. I'm just wondering how much of '14 is in nanometers in '15?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ronald Pasek (Executives)】\nSo, Gust, our long term model for R&D is 19% to 21%. So we're a little above that this year. We're going to grow our way into -- as I said, growing revenue faster than R&D.\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Daane (Executives)】\nAnd as I mentioned a few moments ago, we do not see the oscillation as much as we did in prior years. I think it's probably been 8 to 10 years since we've seen that, that sort of significant oscillation within R&D associated with tapeouts. Really is a factor of the fact that we're doing so many products in parallel, we have a lot of tapeouts every year. And therefore -- and if you think about it, we're doing a lot of different families right now. So you've seen those introduced from us. So ultimately, it's a product of the R&D pipeline that we have that has evened out the mask and wafer spend. And as Ron said earlier, again, this is an area that we expense so these are not capitalized items. Thank you very much.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Pitzer (Analysts)】\nYes, John, I know you want to stay away from kind of the top line expectations for next year, but given sort of all the new application markets that you guys have kind of tried to exploit over the last several years, it sounds like some of them are going to come to fortune [ph] in '15. I'm just kind of curious of how we should think about your growth rate relative to the overall semi market. If you look at the data it's sort of mixed just to whether or not PLDs have actually outgrown ASICs/semis. Is next year on your mind or just end of year of outgrowth for Altera relative to kind of the overall broader semi market?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Daane (Executives)】\nWell, I guess, what I could do is, John, is kind of put this in context of what we've seen in the past. So what we've seen in the past is Altera may not outgrow the end markets necessarily every year. But if you sort of take 3 or 5 years together, what you'll see through a cycle is that we will, on average, outgrow the non-memory portion of the semiconductor industry. And usually by about 2x. And that's been true over the last 5 years and it's generally been true over that entire period of time. And the reason I say we will not necessarily outperform every year is if you sort of get into the 2012, 2013 cycle, semiconductors was roughly flat as an industry, but more of the spending shifted from infrastructure in 2010, '11 to -- and '12 and '13, it was more focused on handsets. And obviously, we're an infrastructure player, not a handset player. So we underperformed in '12, '13. In '14, you saw the return of infrastructure spending again, not just in communications, but also certainly, in industrial and a number of the other segments. So we talked about the fact that we've got computers, a new growth area for us and I think overall, if you kind of look at 2014, we probably outperformed the non-memory portion of semiconductor industry by well over 2x. So yes, so I still think that's probably holds for us. To be honest, I haven't looked in detail at forecast for next year to compare what our plan is for -- versus other companies' forecast. So I really can't do it on a forward-looking basis. I can just use history and say that based on history, we would expect that to continue for us and that being the continued out-performance of the non-memory portion of the semiconductor industry on average. Thank you very much.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Scott Wylie (Executives)】\nThank you, operator. This concludes Altera's conference call. Thanks for your interest and participation.",

With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, IT and ALLDATA; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax.\r\nRegarding the first quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, is available on our website, www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them.\r\nTo begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across the globe for another solid quarter and a very good start to the new fiscal year. We remain focused this past quarter on several key initiatives and on growing our business on a variety of fronts. \r\nI thought I'd begin this morning recapping the various aspects of our business as it has become more complex in recent years. We have diversified our portfolio with an emphasis on building additional legs of growth. \r\nFirst, we have our retail domestic business, which generates approximately 70% of our revenue. This business performed quite well in Q1, and we continue to see opportunities for future growth in store count and same-store sales. \r\nSecondly, we have our commercial domestic business, which has been growing sales by double digits for 5 years and continues to be a tremendous growth opportunity. We also have international retail and commercial businesses in Mexico and Brazil. We've been doing business in Mexico since late 1998, and our model has proven to work quite well. \r\nIn Brazil, we are still in test phase but our sales have continued to grow nicely. We also have a growing Internet business supported by both autozone.com and AutoAnything. And we have our ALLDATA business, which is the leading diagnostic and repair business in the United States. We've expanded that business to both Canada and Europe in recent years. \r\nAnd finally, we recently acquired IMC, which focuses on the import parts business and provides us with a new growth opportunity and new avenues to provide AutoZone customers with an expanded product assortment.\r\nThis past quarter, our U.S. Retail business expanded with the opening of 22 new stores. We also opened 61 net new commercial programs. Our commercial business continued to gain traction, growing sales 13% for the quarter. We now have commercial programs in 78% of our domestic stores, having opened 816 new programs in just the past 2 years. And we have opened 4 new stores in Mexico during the quarter. In Brazil, we continue to operate 5 stores and expect to open a couple of new ones over the next few months.\r\nWe currently have approximately 8% of our total stores outside of the United States. We believe we have growth opportunities in the U.S. and outside the U.S. for many years to come.\r\nIn the first quarter, our sales accelerated on a same-store basis compared to last quarter. We reported a same-store sales increase of 4.5%, up from 2.1% in Q4 of last year. We were pleased to see we gained traction in sales categories where we've added merchandise, and our commercial business benefited from both the inventory additions and the diligent focus on growing sales in our older programs with particular emphasis on mature customers. \r\nWe were pleased with our sales performance throughout the quarter that our DIY business was particularly strong in the last 2 weeks when much of the country experienced the first significant cold-weather spell. Our results were also generally consistent across all regions of the country. While the weather experienced at the end of the quarter accelerated our growth even further, our sales throughout the quarter were noticeably improved from Q4 in virtually every week. Our belief is that the reduced gas prices are giving our customers additional disposable income and helping drive our sales. \r\nAdditionally and more importantly, we believe the work we have been doing over the last year on inventory availability is also contributing to improved sales performance. Over the last year, we have implemented our new algorithms for inventory assortments, and those products have been in our stores now for over 6 months. These are generally slower moving products, but as our customers experienced the improved depth of our inventory, these products are continuing to gain traction. Overall, we were quite pleased with our sales performance in Q1.\r\nOur inventory per store increased over our Q4 2014 levels. The primary driver of this increase was the inventory added through the acquisition of IMC. The IMC stores carry on average 8x to 10x the inventory per location our basic AutoZone stores do. \r\nWhile we were more aggressive with our inventory additions this past year, we feel future investments will be more targeted and refined. Additionally, when we implemented our new assortment methodology last year, we made a decision to only execute half of the deletes of underproductive merchandise in order to mitigate the potential risk of such a significant change. We are in the process of executing the additional deletions over the next few quarters.\r\nOverall, we believe our growth in inventory per store will continue, but at a more modest pace than last year. We'll continue to assess and analyze our changes, and we will continue to refine our methodologies over time, but the majority of this initiative will be completed once the additional deletions are removed. \r\nSecondly, as we mentioned during the last several quarterly calls, we've been testing different delivery frequencies from our distribution centers. Our ongoing tests have shown us the increased delivery frequency increases sales and improves inventory productivity by reducing safety stock. \r\nThe important takeaway here is we continued to expand these tests and have added more stores to these tests. As we've been testing for about a year, our results to date have been encouraging, and we plan to further expand the test in Q3. Once we have confirmed our findings, we will develop a long-term plan and explain our strategy and its ramifications to you. We would expect to do this in the next couple of quarters.\r\nUltimately, assuming our findings are confirmed, we would expect to increase the delivery frequency to most of our stores, and we would expect to add 2 to 3 additional distribution centers to do this cost effectively and on a timely basis. \r\nAdditionally, we've been testing, what we call, mega hubs. Mega hubs have substantially increased product assortments, and they leverage those increased product assortments across other hub networks, providing stores across a large geography access to this expanded assortment. We've been testing 2 mega hubs for about a year. Both of them have been performing well, and we will be opening 3 additional mega hubs over the course of this fiscal year. This too is still in test phase but we are pleased with the performance to date.\r\nAll of our inventory availability initiatives are designed to significantly increase our ability to meet our customers' needs. In this business, inventory availability is a must. And we believe once this work is completed, we will materially improve our ability to fulfill our customers' requests. \r\nAs our commercial business has grown, our need for expanded assortments has grown even more. Again, we are continuing to test and we're expanding our test to validate our findings to date. We will keep you abreast of these developments. This has been important and difficult work, and I would like to thank everyone in the organization who has been involved with this initiative for their excellent work to date.\r\nLast quarter, we held our national sales meeting here in Memphis. This year's operating plan theme, Wow! Every Customer Everywhere, was very well received. The customer is our central focus in everything we do, or like we say at AutoZone, AutoZoners always put customers first.\r\nWe have always been focused on service, but this annual operating theme adds intensity and renewed focus. We've made significant system investments and enhancements this past year in order to capture more data about our customers' shopping patterns across all of our platforms. \r\nWe understand we have to be able to toggle between the store, the shop, the phone and online experience in order to meet our customers' needs. At the national sales meeting, my favorite event every year is our recognition luncheon hosting our award-winning store managers or as we call them, our President's Club. It's an opportunity for our officers to meet and answer questions from our best and the brightest store AutoZoners. This year was certainly no exception. These store award winners deserve our gratitude for their efforts each and every day.\r\nNow I'll take a moment to discuss our recently completed acquisition of Interamerican Motor Corporation, doing business in the marketplace as IMC. They are the second-largest distributor of OE quality import replacement parts in the United States. They specialize in parts coverage for European and Asian vehicles. \r\nWhile considerably smaller than the #1 participant in the industry, IMC, with 17 branches today, offers a terrific growth opportunity for us, not just because of the parts coverage, but also because of the very strong management team. They are an exceptional team.\r\nWe closed on the acquisition in September, and we've been fast at work on getting our integration plan in place. While it's very premature, I will mention our plans include opening more IMC branches and incorporating their parts catalog into our AutoZone Z-net parts catalog. We will continue to go to market as IMC and expect to open a handful of new IMC branches over the next 12 months. \r\nWe also expect to have their catalog available in our stores by early spring 2015. I do want to point out, there was very little customer overlap with our commercial customer base.\r\nNow let me stress, the IMC brand is very important to us. We will grow that brand and its presence in the future in many more markets than what it's been today. IMC has been in a growth mode recently and has built an infrastructure to support a substantially larger footprint. Therefore, it currently doesn't enjoy the operating margins that we experience, so that will lower our overall EBIT margins by approximately 40 basis points on an annual basis. We are very excited to have IMC as part of our organization and very optimistic about our future together.\r\nNow let's turn to our first quarter results. Our sales increased 8%, and our domestic same-store sales were up 4.5%. As mentioned previously, our sales improved significantly from Q4 and each month, both retail and commercial experienced positive same-store sales growth. That consistency was across all regions of the country. \r\nWe believe we benefited from both macro tailwinds, our work on inventory availability and solid execution. While our failure-related and maintenance merchandise categories performed well, we were especially happy to see the growth in our maintenance category. \r\nRegarding traffic versus ticket in the DIY business, traffic was negative while ticket was positive. While only slightly negative, traffic improved as the quarter went along and was nicely positive at the end. Our average ticket improved significantly and has returned to more normalized levels after about a year of subdued growth. \r\nThe hard parts additions we've added to our stores have helped ticket growth. Over the last 2 decades, our traffic count has been challenged. The primary driver of this challenge is the improvements in product quality, which has led to fewer failures or longer maintenance intervals. But those improvements have come from technological advancements, and those enhancements have significantly increased the price of the products we sell. We've been managing through this phenomenon, as mentioned, for over 2 decades and expect to continue to do so quite well.\r\nWe opened 61 new commercial programs in the quarter versus 125 programs in the comparable period last year. We have a commercial program in 78% of our domestic store base. Our commercial sales, excluding IMC, were up 13% this quarter. \r\nLastly, I would like to recognize how effective our team delivers consistent earnings in good sales environments and not so good. And that practice has allowed us to deliver an impressive 33 consecutive quarters of double-digit EPS growth. That consistency allows us to be both shareholder-friendly with solid earnings growth and bondholder-friendly through a targeted investment grade rating and strong cash flow. We continue to manage this business for both short-term and long-term optimum performance.\r\nAs part of our strategy to increasing inventory levels in local markets closer to our customers, this past quarter, we opened 5 additional hub locations. Over time, we do expect to open more hub locations, and we believe our strategy on inventory deployment at the store level allows us to keep the number of openings at a moderate level.\r\nRegarding Mexico, we opened 4 stores this quarter. Sales in our other businesses for the quarter were up 6.4% over last year's first quarter. As a reminder, our ALLDATA and eCommerce, which includes autozone.com and AutoAnything, make up this segment of sales. \r\nRegarding online sales opportunities, there continued to be great opportunities for growth on both a business-to-business basis and to individual customers or B2C. While these businesses are small for us, we expect them to grow at a faster rate than our brick-and-mortar business for the foreseeable future.\r\nWith the continued aging of the car population, we continue to be optimistic regarding trends for our industry in both DIY and DIFM. While new car sales have been very strong these past 2 years, we have seen those traded-in vehicles being resold to new owners who are repairing or enhancing their new vehicle. \r\nWith gas prices on average down materially year-over-year for the first quarter, we are beginning to see miles driven increase. Declining prices at the pump have benefited our customers, especially those most financially strapped. The lower end consumer benefits the most from lower gas prices relative to income. The trend is encouraging, but only one of several factors that impact sales. \r\nI know many investors have asked about our sales expectations for the second and third quarters. The comparisons are considerably more difficult. While certain markets and categories outperformed during last winter’s others underperformed. We believe we should improve in those regions and in our maintenance categories should the weather patterns be considerably different. \r\nAs our history has shown, we manage this business focusing on both the short- and long-term performance. As we enter the second quarter, we are keenly focused on delivering consistent strong performance and extending our streak of 33 consecutive quarters of double-digit EPS growth.\r\nOur operating theme for 2015 is Wow! Every Customer Everywhere. And our key priorities for the year are: one, Great People Providing Great Service!; two, profitably growing our commercial business; three, leveraging the Internet; four, leveraging technology to improve the customer experience while optimizing efficiencies; and five, improving inventory availability. \r\nOn the retail front last quarter under the Great People Providing Great Service! theme, we continued with our intense focus on improving execution. Along with the improvements to our catalog assortment, we're incorporating more training tools to help our store AutoZoners provide trustworthy advice. Training will continue be a large effort for us at the store level. \r\nBehind the scenes, we have reset our expectations on technology investment and challenged ourselves to make sure our offerings are relevant across all shopping platforms. We realized as customers have become much more tech- and mobile-savvy, we have to have a sales proposition that touches all the ways they desire to interact with us. Our current and future technology investments will lead to sales growth across all of our businesses.\r\nIn regards to commercial, we opened 61 programs during the quarter. Our expectation is we will continue to open new programs and grow our percentage of stores with the commercial program, although our pace of growth will likely moderate. We expect it -- we expect to open approximately 300 programs this year versus 424 last year. \r\nAs we continue to improve our product assortments and availability and as we make other refinements to our offerings, we expect that the sales potential will continue to increase. Our results continue to provide us confidence to be aggressive in adding additional resources and new programs to this important growth initiative. \r\nWe should also highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital as we were able to finish Q1 at 31.7%. We are very pleased with this metric as it is one of the best, if not the best, in all of hardlines retail. However, our primary focus has been, and continues to be, that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return well in excess of our cost of capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship as the capital we invest is our investors' capital.\r\nBefore I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I'd like to recognize our entire organization for their efforts to manage the business appropriately and prudently. We have an amazing team, and our initiatives for 2015 are exciting. With our ongoing supply chain initiatives, as well as the inclusion and upcoming expansion of IMC, we are ready to continue to provide WOW! Customer Service to all of our customers, and we are ready to continue to prudently manage our cost structure, providing our shareholders with the consistency we have exhibited in the past.\r\nNow here's Bill.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to discuss our retail, commercial and international results for the quarter. \r\nFor the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic retail, IMC and commercial businesses, our Mexico stores and our 5 stores in Brazil, increased 8%. Regarding macro trends, during the quarter, nationally, unleaded gas prices started out at $3.46 a gallon and ended the quarter at $2.82 a gallon, a $0.64 decrease. Last year, gas prices decreased $0.31 per gallon during the first quarter, starting at $3.60 and ending at $3.29 a gallon. We continue to believe gas prices have a real impact on our customers' abilities to maintain their vehicles. As cost reductions help all Americans, we hope to benefit from an increase in disposable income.\r\nWe also recognize that the impact of miles driven on cars over 10 years old, the current average, is much different than on newer cars in terms of wear and tear. Miles driven increased 2.3% in September. Now I don't have October, November data yet, the other statistic we highlight is the number of 7-year and older vehicles on the road, which continues to trend in our industry's favor. \r\nFor the trailing 4 quarters, total sales per auto parts location was $1,746,000. This statistic continues to set the pace for the rest of the industry. \r\nFor the quarter, commercial sales increased 13%. Commercial represented 17% of our total sales and grew $45 million over last year's Q1. Last year's commercial sales mix percent was also 17%.\r\nThis past quarter, we opened 61 new programs versus 125 programs opened in our first quarter of last fiscal year. We now have our commercial program in 3,906 stores supported by 171 hub stores. Approximately 1,200 of our programs are 3 years old or younger. \r\nLet me take a moment and discuss our commercial program performance. As I mentioned, our commercial sales were up 13% this past quarter, a nice acceleration versus last quarter. While our average sales per program is below some peers in our industry at $8,500, we feel we are on the right track to methodically close that gap. \r\nIt's important to highlight that we accelerated our new program growth over the past few years, as approximately 30% of our programs are younger than 3 years old. These openings have impacted our average sales metric and cannibalized some of our older programs. Part of our focus is on growing market share and improving our service levels by having more programs closer to our customers.\r\nThis year, we are increasingly focused on measuring and growing sales in our older programs and with specific emphasis on our long-term customer growth. \r\nLooking specifically at our mature programs, those at least 5 years old, they grew in the high single-digit range this past quarter. Additionally, we still have significant opportunity to open additional programs over the next several years. We feel good about the successes we've had in profitably growing the commercial business. \r\nIn summary, we remain committed to our long-term growth strategy. We believe the improvements we have made and upcoming additional improvements from our inventory availability initiatives enhance our prospects. And we believe the addition of IMC will provide us with additional avenues to service our commercial customers very effectively. We believe we are well positioned to grow this business and capture increased market share.\r\nOur Mexico stores continued to perform well. We opened 4 new stores during the first quarter and currently have 406 stores in Mexico. We expect to open a similar number of stores in Mexico this fiscal year than we opened last year. Our returns and profit growth continue to be in line with our expectations. \r\nNow regarding Brazil, we are currently operating 5 stores. We didn't open any stores this quarter. Our plans remain to open a few more stores and then refine our offerings and prove that our concept works for our customers and is financially viable. \r\nOur sales growth has been very encouraging and on plan, but we continue to operate at considerable loss. This is due, as expected, to having such a small store base in carrying distribution capabilities and overhead that can handle far more stores. Once we refine our offerings in operations and evaluate the performance, we will provide you with an update on our long-term growth plans.\r\nRecapping this past quarter's performance for the company, in total, our sales were $2,260,000,000, an increase of 8%. Domestic same-store sales or sales for stores open more than 1 year were up 4.5% for the quarter. \r\nGross margin for the quarter was 52.1% of sales, up 20 basis points. The improvement in gross margin was attributable to higher merchandise margins and lower shrink expense, partially offset by the impact on margin from the IMC acquisition.\r\nIn regards to inflation, it has been basically nonexistent for a couple of years now. While certain categories have had some price increases in general, they have slightly more decreases. At this point, our assumption is we'll experience subdued producer pricing heading into the new calendar year, and therefore, we feel costs will be predictable and manageable. We will remain cognizant of our future developments regarding inflation, and we'll make the appropriate adjustments should they arise. \r\nLooking forward, we continue to believe there remains opportunity for gross margin expansion within both the retail and commercial businesses. However, we do not manage to a targeted gross margin percentage. As the growth of our commercial business has been a steady headwind on our overall gross margin rate for a few years, we've not bothered to call out the headwind quarterly, as it is part of our operating model. \r\nAdditionally, until we anniversary the acquisition, IMC will present a headwind on our gross margin of approximately 30 basis points over the next 3 quarters, as this business model operates at a lower gross margin rate. Our primary focus remains growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total auto parts segment.\r\nSG&A for the quarter was 33.98% of sales, higher by 45 basis points from last year's first quarter. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to higher legal costs and self-insured medical costs. IMC will also have approximately 10 basis points of deleverage on SG&A in the upcoming quarters. We continue to believe we are well positioned to manage our cost structure in response to our sales environment.\r\nEBIT for the quarter was $409 million, up 6.5% over last year's first quarter. Our EBIT margin was down 25 basis points at 18.1%. Interest expense for the quarter was $37.1 million compared with $42.4 million in Q1 a year ago. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $4,422,000,000 or approximately $250 million more than last year's balance of $4,174,000,000. \r\nOur adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.5x EBITDAR. While in any given quarter, we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment grade rating and our capital allocation strategy, and share repurchases are an important element of that strategy.\r\nFor the quarter, our tax rate was approximately 35.9%, down slightly from last year's first quarter. We expect our annual rate to be closer to 36.7% on an ongoing basis as the deviation results this quarter was primarily driven by the resolution of discrete tax items that arose.\r\nNet income for the quarter was $238 million, up 9.3%. Our diluted share count of 32.8 million was down 5.5% from last year's first quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $7.27, up 15.6% over the prior year's first quarter.\r\nRelating to the cash flow statement for the first fiscal quarter, we generated $375 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 8% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $92 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 27 new stores this quarter, capital expenditures on existing stores, hub store remodels, work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters and information technology investments.\r\nWhen the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 5,006 stores in 49 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico; 406 stores in Mexico; 17 IMC locations and 5 stores in Brazil for a total count of 5,434.\r\nDepreciation totaled $61 million for the quarter versus last year's first quarter expense of $56 million. This is in line with the recent quarter growth rates.\r\nWith our excess cash flow, we repurchased $300 million of AutoZone stock in the first quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had $570 million remaining under our share buyback authorization, and our leverage metric was 2.5x. Again, I want to stress, we manage to appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only, as each rating firm has its own criteria. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy. Accounts payable, as a percent of gross inventory, finished the quarter at 112.5%. The inclusion of IMC reduced the AP ratio approximately 150 basis points. \r\nNext, I'd like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per-store basis. We reported an inventory balance of $3.3 billion, up 11% versus the Q1 ending balance last year. Increased inventory reflects the recent IMC acquisition, new store growth and additional investments and coverage. Inventory per store was up 6.7% at $604,000 per store, reflecting our continued investments in hard parts coverage and the IMC acquisition. Increase in inventory per store this quarter from last quarter was predominantly IMC driven, which added just over $10,000 per store to this metric. Excluding IMC, inventory was up 9% over the last year of Q1.\r\nFinally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing 4 quarters of 31.7%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital.\r\nNow I'll turn it back to Bill Rhodes.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Bill. We are pleased this morning to report our 33rd consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth, growing this quarter at a rate of 15.6%. Our company has continued to be successful over the long run. That success is attributable to our approach to leveraging our unique and powerful culture and focusing on the needs of our customers. \r\nAt the end of the day, our customers have choices. We must innovate to ensure they turn to us for their vehicle needs. As we continue to invest in our businesses and monitor the results from our ongoing inventory initiatives, we are optimistic about our future. We feel like we continue to be on the right track. \r\nAgain, we are excited about our initiatives around inventory assortment, hub stores, commercial growth, Mexico, ALLDATA, eCommerce, Brazil and now, IMC. Our long-term model is to grow new store square footage at a low single-digit growth rate, and we expect to continue growing our commercial business at an accelerated rate. Therefore, we look to routinely grow EBIT dollars in the mid-single-digit range or better in times of strength. And we leveraged our very strong and predictable cash flow to repurchase shares, enhancing our earnings per share growth in the double digits.\r\nWe feel the track we are on will allow us to continue winning for the long run. We believe our steady, consistent strategy is correct. It is the attention to details and consistent execution that will matter. Our belief is solid consistent strategy, combined with superior execution is a formula for success. Our charge remains to optimize our performance regardless of market conditions and continue to ensure we are investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance. In the end, delivering strong EPS growth and ROIC each and every quarter is how we measure ourselves.\r\nWe are pleased with our results this past quarter, but we must remain committed to delivering on our strategic and financial objectives.\r\nNow we'd like to open up the call for questions.",

With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, IT and ALLDATA; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax.\r\nRegarding the first quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, is available on our website, www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them.\r\nTo begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across the globe for another solid quarter and a very good start to the new fiscal year. We remain focused this past quarter on several key initiatives and on growing our business on a variety of fronts. \r\nI thought I'd begin this morning recapping the various aspects of our business as it has become more complex in recent years. We have diversified our portfolio with an emphasis on building additional legs of growth. \r\nFirst, we have our retail domestic business, which generates approximately 70% of our revenue. This business performed quite well in Q1, and we continue to see opportunities for future growth in store count and same-store sales. \r\nSecondly, we have our commercial domestic business, which has been growing sales by double digits for 5 years and continues to be a tremendous growth opportunity. We also have international retail and commercial businesses in Mexico and Brazil. We've been doing business in Mexico since late 1998, and our model has proven to work quite well. \r\nIn Brazil, we are still in test phase but our sales have continued to grow nicely. We also have a growing Internet business supported by both autozone.com and AutoAnything. And we have our ALLDATA business, which is the leading diagnostic and repair business in the United States. We've expanded that business to both Canada and Europe in recent years. \r\nAnd finally, we recently acquired IMC, which focuses on the import parts business and provides us with a new growth opportunity and new avenues to provide AutoZone customers with an expanded product assortment.\r\nThis past quarter, our U.S. Retail business expanded with the opening of 22 new stores. We also opened 61 net new commercial programs. Our commercial business continued to gain traction, growing sales 13% for the quarter. We now have commercial programs in 78% of our domestic stores, having opened 816 new programs in just the past 2 years. And we have opened 4 new stores in Mexico during the quarter. In Brazil, we continue to operate 5 stores and expect to open a couple of new ones over the next few months.\r\nWe currently have approximately 8% of our total stores outside of the United States. We believe we have growth opportunities in the U.S. and outside the U.S. for many years to come.\r\nIn the first quarter, our sales accelerated on a same-store basis compared to last quarter. We reported a same-store sales increase of 4.5%, up from 2.1% in Q4 of last year. We were pleased to see we gained traction in sales categories where we've added merchandise, and our commercial business benefited from both the inventory additions and the diligent focus on growing sales in our older programs with particular emphasis on mature customers. \r\nWe were pleased with our sales performance throughout the quarter that our DIY business was particularly strong in the last 2 weeks when much of the country experienced the first significant cold-weather spell. Our results were also generally consistent across all regions of the country. While the weather experienced at the end of the quarter accelerated our growth even further, our sales throughout the quarter were noticeably improved from Q4 in virtually every week. Our belief is that the reduced gas prices are giving our customers additional disposable income and helping drive our sales. \r\nAdditionally and more importantly, we believe the work we have been doing over the last year on inventory availability is also contributing to improved sales performance. Over the last year, we have implemented our new algorithms for inventory assortments, and those products have been in our stores now for over 6 months. These are generally slower moving products, but as our customers experienced the improved depth of our inventory, these products are continuing to gain traction. Overall, we were quite pleased with our sales performance in Q1.\r\nOur inventory per store increased over our Q4 2014 levels. The primary driver of this increase was the inventory added through the acquisition of IMC. The IMC stores carry on average 8x to 10x the inventory per location our basic AutoZone stores do. \r\nWhile we were more aggressive with our inventory additions this past year, we feel future investments will be more targeted and refined. Additionally, when we implemented our new assortment methodology last year, we made a decision to only execute half of the deletes of underproductive merchandise in order to mitigate the potential risk of such a significant change. We are in the process of executing the additional deletions over the next few quarters.\r\nOverall, we believe our growth in inventory per store will continue, but at a more modest pace than last year. We'll continue to assess and analyze our changes, and we will continue to refine our methodologies over time, but the majority of this initiative will be completed once the additional deletions are removed. \r\nSecondly, as we mentioned during the last several quarterly calls, we've been testing different delivery frequencies from our distribution centers. Our ongoing tests have shown us the increased delivery frequency increases sales and improves inventory productivity by reducing safety stock. \r\nThe important takeaway here is we continued to expand these tests and have added more stores to these tests. As we've been testing for about a year, our results to date have been encouraging, and we plan to further expand the test in Q3. Once we have confirmed our findings, we will develop a long-term plan and explain our strategy and its ramifications to you. We would expect to do this in the next couple of quarters.\r\nUltimately, assuming our findings are confirmed, we would expect to increase the delivery frequency to most of our stores, and we would expect to add 2 to 3 additional distribution centers to do this cost effectively and on a timely basis. \r\nAdditionally, we've been testing, what we call, mega hubs. Mega hubs have substantially increased product assortments, and they leverage those increased product assortments across other hub networks, providing stores across a large geography access to this expanded assortment. We've been testing 2 mega hubs for about a year. Both of them have been performing well, and we will be opening 3 additional mega hubs over the course of this fiscal year. This too is still in test phase but we are pleased with the performance to date.\r\nAll of our inventory availability initiatives are designed to significantly increase our ability to meet our customers' needs. In this business, inventory availability is a must. And we believe once this work is completed, we will materially improve our ability to fulfill our customers' requests. \r\nAs our commercial business has grown, our need for expanded assortments has grown even more. Again, we are continuing to test and we're expanding our test to validate our findings to date. We will keep you abreast of these developments. This has been important and difficult work, and I would like to thank everyone in the organization who has been involved with this initiative for their excellent work to date.\r\nLast quarter, we held our national sales meeting here in Memphis. This year's operating plan theme, Wow! Every Customer Everywhere, was very well received. The customer is our central focus in everything we do, or like we say at AutoZone, AutoZoners always put customers first.\r\nWe have always been focused on service, but this annual operating theme adds intensity and renewed focus. We've made significant system investments and enhancements this past year in order to capture more data about our customers' shopping patterns across all of our platforms. \r\nWe understand we have to be able to toggle between the store, the shop, the phone and online experience in order to meet our customers' needs. At the national sales meeting, my favorite event every year is our recognition luncheon hosting our award-winning store managers or as we call them, our President's Club. It's an opportunity for our officers to meet and answer questions from our best and the brightest store AutoZoners. This year was certainly no exception. These store award winners deserve our gratitude for their efforts each and every day.\r\nNow I'll take a moment to discuss our recently completed acquisition of Interamerican Motor Corporation, doing business in the marketplace as IMC. They are the second-largest distributor of OE quality import replacement parts in the United States. They specialize in parts coverage for European and Asian vehicles. \r\nWhile considerably smaller than the #1 participant in the industry, IMC, with 17 branches today, offers a terrific growth opportunity for us, not just because of the parts coverage, but also because of the very strong management team. They are an exceptional team.\r\nWe closed on the acquisition in September, and we've been fast at work on getting our integration plan in place. While it's very premature, I will mention our plans include opening more IMC branches and incorporating their parts catalog into our AutoZone Z-net parts catalog. We will continue to go to market as IMC and expect to open a handful of new IMC branches over the next 12 months. \r\nWe also expect to have their catalog available in our stores by early spring 2015. I do want to point out, there was very little customer overlap with our commercial customer base.\r\nNow let me stress, the IMC brand is very important to us. We will grow that brand and its presence in the future in many more markets than what it's been today. IMC has been in a growth mode recently and has built an infrastructure to support a substantially larger footprint. Therefore, it currently doesn't enjoy the operating margins that we experience, so that will lower our overall EBIT margins by approximately 40 basis points on an annual basis. We are very excited to have IMC as part of our organization and very optimistic about our future together.\r\nNow let's turn to our first quarter results. Our sales increased 8%, and our domestic same-store sales were up 4.5%. As mentioned previously, our sales improved significantly from Q4 and each month, both retail and commercial experienced positive same-store sales growth. That consistency was across all regions of the country. \r\nWe believe we benefited from both macro tailwinds, our work on inventory availability and solid execution. While our failure-related and maintenance merchandise categories performed well, we were especially happy to see the growth in our maintenance category. \r\nRegarding traffic versus ticket in the DIY business, traffic was negative while ticket was positive. While only slightly negative, traffic improved as the quarter went along and was nicely positive at the end. Our average ticket improved significantly and has returned to more normalized levels after about a year of subdued growth. \r\nThe hard parts additions we've added to our stores have helped ticket growth. Over the last 2 decades, our traffic count has been challenged. The primary driver of this challenge is the improvements in product quality, which has led to fewer failures or longer maintenance intervals. But those improvements have come from technological advancements, and those enhancements have significantly increased the price of the products we sell. We've been managing through this phenomenon, as mentioned, for over 2 decades and expect to continue to do so quite well.\r\nWe opened 61 new commercial programs in the quarter versus 125 programs in the comparable period last year. We have a commercial program in 78% of our domestic store base. Our commercial sales, excluding IMC, were up 13% this quarter. \r\nLastly, I would like to recognize how effective our team delivers consistent earnings in good sales environments and not so good. And that practice has allowed us to deliver an impressive 33 consecutive quarters of double-digit EPS growth. That consistency allows us to be both shareholder-friendly with solid earnings growth and bondholder-friendly through a targeted investment grade rating and strong cash flow. We continue to manage this business for both short-term and long-term optimum performance.\r\nAs part of our strategy to increasing inventory levels in local markets closer to our customers, this past quarter, we opened 5 additional hub locations. Over time, we do expect to open more hub locations, and we believe our strategy on inventory deployment at the store level allows us to keep the number of openings at a moderate level.\r\nRegarding Mexico, we opened 4 stores this quarter. Sales in our other businesses for the quarter were up 6.4% over last year's first quarter. As a reminder, our ALLDATA and eCommerce, which includes autozone.com and AutoAnything, make up this segment of sales. \r\nRegarding online sales opportunities, there continued to be great opportunities for growth on both a business-to-business basis and to individual customers or B2C. While these businesses are small for us, we expect them to grow at a faster rate than our brick-and-mortar business for the foreseeable future.\r\nWith the continued aging of the car population, we continue to be optimistic regarding trends for our industry in both DIY and DIFM. While new car sales have been very strong these past 2 years, we have seen those traded-in vehicles being resold to new owners who are repairing or enhancing their new vehicle. \r\nWith gas prices on average down materially year-over-year for the first quarter, we are beginning to see miles driven increase. Declining prices at the pump have benefited our customers, especially those most financially strapped. The lower end consumer benefits the most from lower gas prices relative to income. The trend is encouraging, but only one of several factors that impact sales. \r\nI know many investors have asked about our sales expectations for the second and third quarters. The comparisons are considerably more difficult. While certain markets and categories outperformed during last winter’s others underperformed. We believe we should improve in those regions and in our maintenance categories should the weather patterns be considerably different. \r\nAs our history has shown, we manage this business focusing on both the short- and long-term performance. As we enter the second quarter, we are keenly focused on delivering consistent strong performance and extending our streak of 33 consecutive quarters of double-digit EPS growth.\r\nOur operating theme for 2015 is Wow! Every Customer Everywhere. And our key priorities for the year are: one, Great People Providing Great Service!; two, profitably growing our commercial business; three, leveraging the Internet; four, leveraging technology to improve the customer experience while optimizing efficiencies; and five, improving inventory availability. \r\nOn the retail front last quarter under the Great People Providing Great Service! theme, we continued with our intense focus on improving execution. Along with the improvements to our catalog assortment, we're incorporating more training tools to help our store AutoZoners provide trustworthy advice. Training will continue be a large effort for us at the store level. \r\nBehind the scenes, we have reset our expectations on technology investment and challenged ourselves to make sure our offerings are relevant across all shopping platforms. We realized as customers have become much more tech- and mobile-savvy, we have to have a sales proposition that touches all the ways they desire to interact with us. Our current and future technology investments will lead to sales growth across all of our businesses.\r\nIn regards to commercial, we opened 61 programs during the quarter. Our expectation is we will continue to open new programs and grow our percentage of stores with the commercial program, although our pace of growth will likely moderate. We expect it -- we expect to open approximately 300 programs this year versus 424 last year. \r\nAs we continue to improve our product assortments and availability and as we make other refinements to our offerings, we expect that the sales potential will continue to increase. Our results continue to provide us confidence to be aggressive in adding additional resources and new programs to this important growth initiative. \r\nWe should also highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital as we were able to finish Q1 at 31.7%. We are very pleased with this metric as it is one of the best, if not the best, in all of hardlines retail. However, our primary focus has been, and continues to be, that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return well in excess of our cost of capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship as the capital we invest is our investors' capital.\r\nBefore I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I'd like to recognize our entire organization for their efforts to manage the business appropriately and prudently. We have an amazing team, and our initiatives for 2015 are exciting. With our ongoing supply chain initiatives, as well as the inclusion and upcoming expansion of IMC, we are ready to continue to provide WOW! Customer Service to all of our customers, and we are ready to continue to prudently manage our cost structure, providing our shareholders with the consistency we have exhibited in the past.\r\nNow here's Bill.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: William Giles (Executives)】\nThanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to discuss our retail, commercial and international results for the quarter. \r\nFor the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic retail, IMC and commercial businesses, our Mexico stores and our 5 stores in Brazil, increased 8%. Regarding macro trends, during the quarter, nationally, unleaded gas prices started out at $3.46 a gallon and ended the quarter at $2.82 a gallon, a $0.64 decrease. Last year, gas prices decreased $0.31 per gallon during the first quarter, starting at $3.60 and ending at $3.29 a gallon. We continue to believe gas prices have a real impact on our customers' abilities to maintain their vehicles. As cost reductions help all Americans, we hope to benefit from an increase in disposable income.\r\nWe also recognize that the impact of miles driven on cars over 10 years old, the current average, is much different than on newer cars in terms of wear and tear. Miles driven increased 2.3% in September. Now I don't have October, November data yet, the other statistic we highlight is the number of 7-year and older vehicles on the road, which continues to trend in our industry's favor. \r\nFor the trailing 4 quarters, total sales per auto parts location was $1,746,000. This statistic continues to set the pace for the rest of the industry. \r\nFor the quarter, commercial sales increased 13%. Commercial represented 17% of our total sales and grew $45 million over last year's Q1. Last year's commercial sales mix percent was also 17%.\r\nThis past quarter, we opened 61 new programs versus 125 programs opened in our first quarter of last fiscal year. We now have our commercial program in 3,906 stores supported by 171 hub stores. Approximately 1,200 of our programs are 3 years old or younger. \r\nLet me take a moment and discuss our commercial program performance. As I mentioned, our commercial sales were up 13% this past quarter, a nice acceleration versus last quarter. While our average sales per program is below some peers in our industry at $8,500, we feel we are on the right track to methodically close that gap. \r\nIt's important to highlight that we accelerated our new program growth over the past few years, as approximately 30% of our programs are younger than 3 years old. These openings have impacted our average sales metric and cannibalized some of our older programs. Part of our focus is on growing market share and improving our service levels by having more programs closer to our customers.\r\nThis year, we are increasingly focused on measuring and growing sales in our older programs and with specific emphasis on our long-term customer growth. \r\nLooking specifically at our mature programs, those at least 5 years old, they grew in the high single-digit range this past quarter. Additionally, we still have significant opportunity to open additional programs over the next several years. We feel good about the successes we've had in profitably growing the commercial business. \r\nIn summary, we remain committed to our long-term growth strategy. We believe the improvements we have made and upcoming additional improvements from our inventory availability initiatives enhance our prospects. And we believe the addition of IMC will provide us with additional avenues to service our commercial customers very effectively. We believe we are well positioned to grow this business and capture increased market share.\r\nOur Mexico stores continued to perform well. We opened 4 new stores during the first quarter and currently have 406 stores in Mexico. We expect to open a similar number of stores in Mexico this fiscal year than we opened last year. Our returns and profit growth continue to be in line with our expectations. \r\nNow regarding Brazil, we are currently operating 5 stores. We didn't open any stores this quarter. Our plans remain to open a few more stores and then refine our offerings and prove that our concept works for our customers and is financially viable. \r\nOur sales growth has been very encouraging and on plan, but we continue to operate at considerable loss. This is due, as expected, to having such a small store base in carrying distribution capabilities and overhead that can handle far more stores. Once we refine our offerings in operations and evaluate the performance, we will provide you with an update on our long-term growth plans.\r\nRecapping this past quarter's performance for the company, in total, our sales were $2,260,000,000, an increase of 8%. Domestic same-store sales or sales for stores open more than 1 year were up 4.5% for the quarter. \r\nGross margin for the quarter was 52.1% of sales, up 20 basis points. The improvement in gross margin was attributable to higher merchandise margins and lower shrink expense, partially offset by the impact on margin from the IMC acquisition.\r\nIn regards to inflation, it has been basically nonexistent for a couple of years now. While certain categories have had some price increases in general, they have slightly more decreases. At this point, our assumption is we'll experience subdued producer pricing heading into the new calendar year, and therefore, we feel costs will be predictable and manageable. We will remain cognizant of our future developments regarding inflation, and we'll make the appropriate adjustments should they arise. \r\nLooking forward, we continue to believe there remains opportunity for gross margin expansion within both the retail and commercial businesses. However, we do not manage to a targeted gross margin percentage. As the growth of our commercial business has been a steady headwind on our overall gross margin rate for a few years, we've not bothered to call out the headwind quarterly, as it is part of our operating model. \r\nAdditionally, until we anniversary the acquisition, IMC will present a headwind on our gross margin of approximately 30 basis points over the next 3 quarters, as this business model operates at a lower gross margin rate. Our primary focus remains growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total auto parts segment.\r\nSG&A for the quarter was 33.98% of sales, higher by 45 basis points from last year's first quarter. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to higher legal costs and self-insured medical costs. IMC will also have approximately 10 basis points of deleverage on SG&A in the upcoming quarters. We continue to believe we are well positioned to manage our cost structure in response to our sales environment.\r\nEBIT for the quarter was $409 million, up 6.5% over last year's first quarter. Our EBIT margin was down 25 basis points at 18.1%. Interest expense for the quarter was $37.1 million compared with $42.4 million in Q1 a year ago. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $4,422,000,000 or approximately $250 million more than last year's balance of $4,174,000,000. \r\nOur adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.5x EBITDAR. While in any given quarter, we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment grade rating and our capital allocation strategy, and share repurchases are an important element of that strategy.\r\nFor the quarter, our tax rate was approximately 35.9%, down slightly from last year's first quarter. We expect our annual rate to be closer to 36.7% on an ongoing basis as the deviation results this quarter was primarily driven by the resolution of discrete tax items that arose.\r\nNet income for the quarter was $238 million, up 9.3%. Our diluted share count of 32.8 million was down 5.5% from last year's first quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $7.27, up 15.6% over the prior year's first quarter.\r\nRelating to the cash flow statement for the first fiscal quarter, we generated $375 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 8% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $92 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 27 new stores this quarter, capital expenditures on existing stores, hub store remodels, work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters and information technology investments.\r\nWhen the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 5,006 stores in 49 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico; 406 stores in Mexico; 17 IMC locations and 5 stores in Brazil for a total count of 5,434.\r\nDepreciation totaled $61 million for the quarter versus last year's first quarter expense of $56 million. This is in line with the recent quarter growth rates.\r\nWith our excess cash flow, we repurchased $300 million of AutoZone stock in the first quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had $570 million remaining under our share buyback authorization, and our leverage metric was 2.5x. Again, I want to stress, we manage to appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only, as each rating firm has its own criteria. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy. Accounts payable, as a percent of gross inventory, finished the quarter at 112.5%. The inclusion of IMC reduced the AP ratio approximately 150 basis points. \r\nNext, I'd like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per-store basis. We reported an inventory balance of $3.3 billion, up 11% versus the Q1 ending balance last year. Increased inventory reflects the recent IMC acquisition, new store growth and additional investments and coverage. Inventory per store was up 6.7% at $604,000 per store, reflecting our continued investments in hard parts coverage and the IMC acquisition. Increase in inventory per store this quarter from last quarter was predominantly IMC driven, which added just over $10,000 per store to this metric. Excluding IMC, inventory was up 9% over the last year of Q1.\r\nFinally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing 4 quarters of 31.7%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital.\r\nNow I'll turn it back to Bill Rhodes.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nThank you, Bill. We are pleased this morning to report our 33rd consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth, growing this quarter at a rate of 15.6%. Our company has continued to be successful over the long run. That success is attributable to our approach to leveraging our unique and powerful culture and focusing on the needs of our customers. \r\nAt the end of the day, our customers have choices. We must innovate to ensure they turn to us for their vehicle needs. As we continue to invest in our businesses and monitor the results from our ongoing inventory initiatives, we are optimistic about our future. We feel like we continue to be on the right track. \r\nAgain, we are excited about our initiatives around inventory assortment, hub stores, commercial growth, Mexico, ALLDATA, eCommerce, Brazil and now, IMC. Our long-term model is to grow new store square footage at a low single-digit growth rate, and we expect to continue growing our commercial business at an accelerated rate. Therefore, we look to routinely grow EBIT dollars in the mid-single-digit range or better in times of strength. And we leveraged our very strong and predictable cash flow to repurchase shares, enhancing our earnings per share growth in the double digits.\r\nWe feel the track we are on will allow us to continue winning for the long run. We believe our steady, consistent strategy is correct. It is the attention to details and consistent execution that will matter. Our belief is solid consistent strategy, combined with superior execution is a formula for success. Our charge remains to optimize our performance regardless of market conditions and continue to ensure we are investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance. In the end, delivering strong EPS growth and ROIC each and every quarter is how we measure ourselves.\r\nWe are pleased with our results this past quarter, but we must remain committed to delivering on our strategic and financial objectives.\r\nNow we'd like to open up the call for questions.",
      "transcript_text3": "First question is for Bill Rhodes. Bill, with all of the new initiatives that you're presently undertaking, whether it's increasing, delivering -- delivery frequency, investment in the mega hubs or the IMC acquisition, it seems like there's a much greater willingness on your part to possibly take on more risk and grow the business at a greater rate. Can you maybe just provide a little bit color on why that seems to be at this point in time? And is there any one of those programs where you have greater confidence than the others?\n\n---\n\nYes, it's a terrific question. I think our -- I would say the pendulum has moved modestly. I don't want to send a message that we've changed our investment profile significantly. But working with our terrific Board of Directors, we've made a decision to take on a little bit more risk and diversify our portfolio a little bit. We mentioned some of them. AutoAnything is also another great example of that, which has allowed us much better insights into the online retail market and provided us with another great team and a good solid business. I think you asked also, which one do we think is the biggest and has the most potential. I would tell you that inventory availability has the most potential because it impacts roughly $8 billion of our revenue today. IMC and AutoAnything are clearly smaller business and good solid businesses and growth aspects, but the inventory availability initiatives can also significantly impact the overall business. Also left out, but we've been growing in Brazil as well. And as we've mentioned, it's cost us a significant amount of money in operating losses down there as we try to get that up and going. At the same time, the thing happened when we were in Mexico initially, and now we sit here with over 400 stores, a very solid business model in Mexico.\n\n---\n\nOkay. So Bill, as you continue to target inventory availability and you test different delivery frequencies, what are you learning? And obviously, it increases revenues, I think that's probably clear. But what are the costs associated with testing those different delivery frequencies? And ultimately, do you believe that this can be accretive to EBIT margins as well as accretive to comps and revenues?\n\n---\n\nThat's a terrific question. I would tell you -- I'll give you some color on it. But the reason we're not saying today here's what we're going to do is because we don't know all of those answers yet. So on delivery frequency, for instance, we've tested 2x a week. We've tested 3x a week. We've tested 5x a week. Still don't know what the right answer is yet. The cost profile of going twice a week is very different in going 5x a week. Similarly with mega hubs. We're finding how far can we go out on a same-day basis versus an overnight basis and the cost profiles are very different. I would tell you that I would not expect that this initiative would be EBIT margin accretive. In fact, I would expect it to be dilutive. I can't tell you today how much it will be dilutive. I wouldn't expect it to be massively dilutive. But it's hard when you're holding yourself to a 19% roughly annual EBIT margin to say, you're going to do new initiatives that are going to meet that. We do not want to hold ourselves to that standard.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And just one last one, if I may, and then I'll pass it on. Is it possible that some stores might be better served with 2x a week as opposed to 3x or 5x? Can there be some variability in the delivery frequency? I'm having a lot of difficulty with that word this morning.\n\n---\n\nYes. It's a difficult word, trust me, I had [indiscernible] 3 times in the prepared comments. Yes, I think that's a question that we're asking ourselves right now. So we have a distribution center in Dallas, Texas, and we have a $70,000 store in Dallas. Going there 5x a week seems pretty easy. We have to go to Fargo, North Dakota. Does it make sense to go 5x a week? Those are questions that we just haven't answered at this point.\n\n---\n\nThe -- you mentioned the potential for 2 to 3 more DCs, or that you expected to put in 2 or 3 more DCs to increase your inventory availability. That seemed to cover a broad range of potential frequencies for deliveries. What kind of range with that 2 to 3 cover? Would that go up to daily? Would that be 2x to 3x a week? How should we think about that?\n\n---\n\nWell, the most we're testing today is 5x. I wouldn't call it daily. But we would be able to reach the network that we think we need to reach on a 2x to 5x a week basis from -- if we added those 3 distribution centers.\n\n---\n\nOkay, fair enough. And then have you talked about what kind of lift you've seen on sales at the stores you've tested 2x to 5x?\n\n---\n\nNo, we haven't yet because we're testing around 150 stores, and we're testing these different profiles. And frankly, the results are mixed. They're all positive, but the range of results are different. Different markets are performing different ways, so we need to get a better handle on it. That's why we are going to expand the test to further validate our results. These are big decisions that we will make, and we're taking our time to make sure we make the right decisions.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then one last one on IMC. Beyond the next 12 months where you said you would add a handful, how do you think about the potential number of warehouses? Obviously, Advance has put up some pretty aggressive numbers out there. But Worldpac with IMC's been at least a similar concept. Any reason you couldn't, over time, may be reach something close to those levels of locations? And then as part of that, could you talk about what -- how capital-intensive the -- a new IMC warehouse is? Any numbers you can share on unit and economics would be helpful.\n\n---\n\nSure. On the number of locations, we think we'll have over 100 at some point in time. Don't see why anybody else will have more than we do. So that will be our plan over time. But we're going to open a handful this year. It's a new business for us, new endeavor for us, and we're going to work with the IMC team to figure out how we can best leverage each other and open up a few, make sure that we get the performance that we want and then we'll accelerate from there.\n\n---\n\nAnd then from a capital perspective, the stores or the locations are typically non-retail and more warehouse location. So they're typically, certainly less than a retail location would cost.\n\n---\n\nSo Bill, in expanding the daily delivery or the delivery capability from 2x to 5x a week, that would still be, I guess, less frequent than your 3 largest competitors in the commercial channel. What do you think that you would be leaving on the table by not going to maybe a multiple daily delivery rate?\n\n---\n\nWell, just to clarify, we will be going multiple times a day from our hub stores and our mega hubs in those markets. And so I don't think we would be -- if we went to 5x a week, I don't think we would be at any competitive disadvantage at that point in time.\n\n---\n\nSo the 2x to 5x per week is from the large distribution center? And then you'd pop off additionally from the hubs and the mega hubs?\n\n---\n\n3x a day typically within a reasonable proximity to the store.\n\n---\n\nSo when you look at roughly the 30% gap and revenue per program, do you think this is the game changer that would get you to that $11,000 to $12,000 a week level?\n\n---\n\nI don't know the answer to that yet, Dan, but what I do know is this will be a material change in our ability to fulfill our customers' needs. We are seeing significant improvements in sales performance. My personal expectation is that will grow over time as our commercial customers, in particular, experience us. They know we'll fulfill their needs at a higher level. And I think it can make a big difference, whether or not that's the silver bullet, I don't think there's a silver bullet that these guys stick to our knitting continuing to improve business every day and get better.\n\n---\n\nA separate question. On the legal expenses, that appears to be about $0.09 a share after tax. Is this a one-off issue tied to the lawsuit that was in the papers a few weeks ago? Or do you think this is going to be an ongoing higher expense rate tied to just the legal environment that you're in?\n\n---\n\nNo, it's more of the former. We want to talk about anything in particular. But obviously, during the quarter, we believe we had a onetime nonrecurring cost. And as you pointed out, it's worth about 22 basis points of SG&A for just this quarter.\n\n---\n\nAnd then the final question for Bill Rhodes. When you think about the benefits of the drop in gasoline prices compared to the headwind from the favorable weather last year, which wins in that tug-of-war.\n\n---\n\nI'm sorry, do you [indiscernible] at the end, Dan.\n\n---\n\nYes. Which is going to be the most relevant, the benefit from the drop in gasoline prices or the headwind from the more difficult sales comparisons from the ideal weather last year?\n\n---\n\nYes. Clearly, we had terrific performance last year in the second quarter. We saw in specific categories, the weather-related categories performed exceedingly well. However, some of the other categories did not perform well. We talked about that last year in the second quarter. So it's going to be -- the weather is going to be what it's going to be. There's not a material of changes that we need to make to our business. So we're going to just go up and slug it up the best we can. On gas prices, they really dropped precipitously just recently, and we think we're beginning to see some of the benefits. I expect the benefits to be bigger over time if they remain at these levels or even go lower. And as far as trying to compare the 2, I think you're -- you have just as good insight from that as I do.\n\n---\n\nA couple of really good questions already asked. I just want to kind of tie it towards the cash flow, if we can. I think back in 2012, you reduced your share counts by 9%, then the following year by 8%, then the following year by 7%. And this year, we're kind of at 5.5%. So what I'm wondering is where do that go and implicit in there, as where does CapEx need to go to accommodate these investments that you got on the docket?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think that's a good question. I think -- so if you look at it over the last several years, we obviously had some benefits on working capital improvement when you look at AP to inventory. And as we've kind of headlined over the last several quarters that we feel great about where we are from an AP-to-inventory ratio well over 100%, we think there are some moderate opportunities for us to continue to improve AP to inventory, but we do not anticipate having a kind of increases in AP to inventory going forward that we experienced over the last several years. Some of that attributed to helping us from a share repurchase perspective. I think relative to capital investments in terms of distributions, et cetera, as Bill mentioned, we may add 2 to 3 distribution centers over the next several years. And we still have work to do to determine whether we -- when we will do it, how many we will do, et cetera. But also keep in mind that we would have added 1 or 2 distribution centers over time anyway just to support our footprint across the United States. I mean, you can clearly get out a map and see that we really don't have a lot of distribution capabilities necessarily in the Northwest relative to the amount of stores that we've opened over the last 5 years. So some of that is inherent in our model overall. So we'll give you a little bit more color on the inventory initiative over the next couple of quarters as we finish out the test and have a better plan. I think from a share repurchase perspective, we think we're in a pretty good position right now, and we'll continue to seek opportunities to improve working capital. But I think that's kind of the gap that you've seen over the last several years.\n\n---\n\nWithout giving us a number, can you tell us where you might have a flex room inside of CapEx, if you did decide to step it up on the DC side? What things might be able to come out to accommodate it?\n\n---\n\nI'm sure there are some things in there. Nothing significant that sticks out at the moment. I mean, the one thing for sure that we want to make sure that we're doing is looking down the road. So we're going to continue to make sure that we're making information system investments in order to support our growth long term, both domestically and internationally. We're very diligent about, according to our pledge, making sure that our stores look great. And we're going to continue to invest in our maintenance and training of our AutoZoners. So there will be opportunities for us to tweak the CapEx a little bit, but we will definitely have some costs relative to distribution centers.\n\n---\n\nThis is Max Aggrey on for Michael Lasser. How far do you think your current inventory initiatives can take you in closing the commercial sales per program gap with your peers?\n\n---\n\nI think it's too early for us to tell. As I mentioned, our performance so far, everything is performing well, but there's a pretty wide band of how they're performing. I also think it's going to take time just because we improve inventory availability. It's going to take us time to further deepen those relationships with our commercial customers. I think we're doing a lot of great things in our commercial business, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks. We've grown commercial double digits for 5 straight quarters, and I think that's pretty impressive. Hopefully, we can continue to do that.\n\n---\n\nAlso, just kind of as a follow-up, can you maybe mention some of the cannibalization that you're seeing from your younger programs at all?\n\n---\n\nWe can internally. We don't necessarily discuss it externally. I think the key is to focus on for this quarter is that we've obviously improved the productivity of our commercial programs on an average weekly sale basis, which is one of the ways we measure it from $8,500 versus $8,300 last year. We're seeing a high single-digit growth out of our mature programs, so we feel pretty good about the programs as they mature. And we recognize that 30% of our overall programs are 3 years old or younger. And so there will continue to be some cannibalization on those more from just transferring mature customers around. But overall, we feel pretty good about the growth rates that we've achieved on commercial, and we feel pretty great about the trend rates that we've seen on commercial.\n\n---\n\nYou guys had same-store sales accelerate 240 basis points from 4Q to 1Q. Can you try to break down the drivers of that acceleration between inventory availability, weather, industry growth, et cetera?\n\n---\n\nOne of the things we thought that weather was probably worth around 1 point or so. And I think from a gas perspective or lower fuel costs, as Bill mentioned before, a lot of that happened late in the quarter. So I suspect that, that benefited some. So x those items, and I think the progression that you saw from comp store sales is really a result of a lot of the initiatives that we put in place. And we think back on inventory optimization, the algorithms that we changed, adding more inventory into the stores, et cetera, and now that baked itself for just about a little over a year now. We feel pretty good about that. And as Bill mentioned before, many of these initiatives, it's going to take time for the customers to recognize the changes that we've made. And so that inventory optimization is a great example of one where it took several months, and now we believe that we're starting to see some benefits baked into our results.\n\n---\n\nGot it. As you look forward, obviously, you don't provide guidance, but from the outside in -- should we be thinking about sort of consistent 2-year stack comps for the next couple of quarters?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think we don't really look at it that way. We're kind of looking at how we're doing right now this past quarter and what do we have in front of us. And as Bill mentioned before, clearly, this next quarter has a high comp because we have some severe weather. And that impacted a lot of failure-related categories in a lot of the Northeast markets. At the same time, there a lot of maintenance categories that underperformed, and there were markets outside of the Northeast that underperformed. So we have to wait and see how it all shakes out. We think that there's opportunities from a category and a region perspective. And if gas prices stay down, that can only be helpful.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then lastly on deflation. Would you expect to see more deflation earnings to your business with oil prices down, impact on oil and chemicals, specifically, as well as products with steel input.\n\n---\n\nIntellectually, a little bit, we would expect to see some deflation, but we haven't seen it yet. So there's been a little bit of deflation on oil. There are other categories that have experienced some inflation. So on the whole, we've seen a relatively benign inflation or deflation in total. We'll have to wait and see how it does shake out. Right now, we don't really see a big change.\n\n---\n\nI want to start up by focusing, if we could, on SG&A. Even when we isolate out the 2 discrete items that you called out, health care and legal, the growth rate in SG&A looks to have picked up a bit. And I guess just slightly from where you were earlier in the year. How should we think about your expense comparisons going forward? And how much discretionary investment would you say was embedded in the underlying SG&A number here in the November quarter?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think it's a good question, Matt. I think that, obviously, we had the legal, we had insurance plus some IMC cost in there that we didn't call out, x those things out, should probably be flat SG&A rate year-over-year, but you have a 4.5 comp. So you would expect to have had some leverage on SG&A above that. And I would think that the way to think through that is we've probably had a little bit from a discretionary perspective and not so much discretionary as these inventory initiatives, although we haven't quantified them. They are a little bit of a headwind from an operating cost perspective, and we would expect those to continue over the next couple of quarters as we continue to test those out. So there are some dollars in there. I'm not going to quantify exactly what the percentages are, but I think we kind of ran a flattish for the quarter, if you will, when you back out some of those items and then probably had a little bit of investments on our initiatives.\n\n---\n\nAnd just to follow that through a little bit, you've had a track record over the past couple of years of tightening your belts a bit when the business has been tough as with the case in your fiscal '13 and then investing a bit more when the business has been better. So because you did that last year, your expense compare looks easy, if you will, just given that you have the -- some sizable increases. Should we consider then perhaps that the compare might be easy, but the investments should persist into the middle of this year, given the supply chain dynamics or supply chain investments remain very much underway?\n\n---\n\nExactly right.\n\n---\n\nAnd then a follow-up. I was just trying to work with some of the numbers you gave us to understand the intrinsic profitability of IMC today and where it could be headed. So presuming that it's about 1.5% of the business pro forma, you talked about a 30 basis point drag on gross margin, I believe you talked about the 10 basis point drag going forward on SG&A. Should that spell out something like a mid-single digit operating margin for that business as we speak?\n\n---\n\nI would say not as we speak. I think we think of them in a growth mode. And so they've got some immature businesses. We're going to continue to invest in those businesses, et cetera. And so we will need to improve the profitability of IMC. And then more importantly, we also need to, over time, help our own commercial customers through IMC products.\n\n---\n\nAnd I know it's a small business, but given that, it's sort of tough to get a precise number. Would you say that business is in the black today? Just to get clear on that.\n\n---\n\nNo. To be clear on that, Matt, just not to talk around it. It's at a slight loss.\n\n---\n\nGot it. And the profit potential of that model over time, as you think about the intrinsic gross margins and term potential, et cetera.\n\n---\n\nYes, I would say that's probably closer to what you were thinking before, which is probably a mid-single digit kind of a number, but the bigger opportunity will be the broader base.\n\n---\n\nI have a couple of follow-ups, I think. One was on the sequential improvement in the comp trend. How much of that was -- I heard traffic was still a little bit negative, but how much of that sequential improvement was traffic versus ticket?\n\n---\n\nI think it was both and I talked about it earlier. The ticket front for about last year or so, it's been really been continuing to grow. It's been subdued. And that trend changed back to kind of normalized trends this quarter. The traffic also improved. As we're looking and talking about the acceleration from Q4, I'll also remind us all that nobody was really happy with Q4. And remember that July was really poor and August was poor as well. So that wasn't necessarily the baseline, if you will.\n\n---\n\nOkay, great. And then just to understand a little bit more about -- I think I heard in the prepared comments that you had lower product acquisition cost. What's driving that? And if you think about it going forward, I think you mentioned inflation just doesn't back it all. Do you think there's actually some deflation likely to come in into next year?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think that -- I think our merchandising organization continues to do a great job both in identifying new vendors for existing product where we can reduce our cost and direct import opportunities overseas, doing things directly or finding new vendors overseas as well. So I think the merchandising organization has done a great job from lowering our acquisition cost. Haven't seen in total a lot of deflation necessarily, but we haven't seen inflation either obviously. Going forward right now, our expectation is that there won't be much deflation or inflation, but clearly in some categories, we expect there'll be a little bit of deflation. So I think overall, that would be relatively flat.\n\n---\n\nAnd remind us where are you now in terms of direct imports as a percentage or...\n\n---\n\nIt's not a significant percent. It's certainly well below 20%.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And Duralast, do you have a number for that?\n\n---\n\nOur family brand of products, the Valucraft, Duralast, Duralast Gold products, our Cmax represent just over 50% of our overall sales.\n\n---\n\nYes, before we conclude the call, I'd like to take a moment to reiterate that we have a long and strong heritage of consistent impressive performance. While we are excited about our growth prospects for the year, we will not take anything for granted, as we understand our customers have choices. We have a solid plan to succeed this fiscal year, but I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long-term shareholder value, we are confident AutoZone will continue to be very successful.\r\nThank you for participating in today's call, and we'd like to wish everyone a very happy and healthy holiday season and a prosperous new year. Thank you.",

I wouldn't expect it to be massively dilutive. But it's hard when you're holding yourself to a 19% roughly annual EBIT margin to say, you're going to do new initiatives that are going to meet that. We do not want to hold ourselves to that standard.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Alan Rifkin (Analysts)】\nOkay. And just one last one, if I may, and then I'll pass it on. Is it possible that some stores might be better served with 2x a week as opposed to 3x or 5x? Can there be some variability in the delivery frequency? I'm having a lot of difficulty with that word this morning.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nYes. It's a difficult word, trust me, I had [indiscernible] 3 times in the prepared comments. Yes, I think that's a question that we're asking ourselves right now. So we have a distribution center in Dallas, Texas, and we have a $70,000 store in Dallas. Going there 5x a week seems pretty easy. We have to go to Fargo, North Dakota. Does it make sense to go 5x a week? Those are questions that we just haven't answered at this point.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Higginbotham (Analysts)】\nThe -- you mentioned the potential for 2 to 3 more DCs, or that you expected to put in 2 or 3 more DCs to increase your inventory availability. That seemed to cover a broad range of potential frequencies for deliveries. What kind of range with that 2 to 3 cover? Would that go up to daily? Would that be 2x to 3x a week? How should we think about that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nWell, the most we're testing today is 5x. I wouldn't call it daily. But we would be able to reach the network that we think we need to reach on a 2x to 5x a week basis from -- if we added those 3 distribution centers.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Higginbotham (Analysts)】\nOkay, fair enough. And then have you talked about what kind of lift you've seen on sales at the stores you've tested 2x to 5x?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nNo, we haven't yet because we're testing around 150 stores, and we're testing these different profiles. And frankly, the results are mixed. They're all positive, but the range of results are different. Different markets are performing different ways, so we need to get a better handle on it. That's why we are going to expand the test to further validate our results. These are big decisions that we will make, and we're taking our time to make sure we make the right decisions.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Higginbotham (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then one last one on IMC. Beyond the next 12 months where you said you would add a handful, how do you think about the potential number of warehouses? Obviously, Advance has put up some pretty aggressive numbers out there. But Worldpac with IMC's been at least a similar concept. Any reason you couldn't, over time, may be reach something close to those levels of locations? And then as part of that, could you talk about what -- how capital-intensive the -- a new IMC warehouse is? Any numbers you can share on unit and economics would be helpful.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nSure. On the number of locations, we think we'll have over 100 at some point in time. Don't see why anybody else will have more than we do. So that will be our plan over time. But we're going to open a handful this year. It's a new business for us, new endeavor for us, and we're going to work with the IMC team to figure out how we can best leverage each other and open up a few, make sure that we get the performance that we want and then we'll accelerate from there.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Giles (Executives)】\nAnd then from a capital perspective, the stores or the locations are typically non-retail and more warehouse location. So they're typically, certainly less than a retail location would cost.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Wewer (Analysts)】\nSo Bill, in expanding the daily delivery or the delivery capability from 2x to 5x a week, that would still be, I guess, less frequent than your 3 largest competitors in the commercial channel. What do you think that you would be leaving on the table by not going to maybe a multiple daily delivery rate?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nWell, just to clarify, we will be going multiple times a day from our hub stores and our mega hubs in those markets. And so I don't think we would be -- if we went to 5x a week, I don't think we would be at any competitive disadvantage at that point in time.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Wewer (Analysts)】\nSo the 2x to 5x per week is from the large distribution center? And then you'd pop off additionally from the hubs and the mega hubs?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\n3x a day typically within a reasonable proximity to the store.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Wewer (Analysts)】\nSo when you look at roughly the 30% gap and revenue per program, do you think this is the game changer that would get you to that $11,000 to $12,000 a week level?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nI don't know the answer to that yet, Dan, but what I do know is this will be a material change in our ability to fulfill our customers' needs. We are seeing significant improvements in sales performance. My personal expectation is that will grow over time as our commercial customers, in particular, experience us. They know we'll fulfill their needs at a higher level. And I think it can make a big difference, whether or not that's the silver bullet, I don't think there's a silver bullet that these guys stick to our knitting continuing to improve business every day and get better.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Wewer (Analysts)】\nA separate question. On the legal expenses, that appears to be about $0.09 a share after tax. Is this a one-off issue tied to the lawsuit that was in the papers a few weeks ago? Or do you think this is going to be an ongoing higher expense rate tied to just the legal environment that you're in?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Giles (Executives)】\nNo, it's more of the former. We want to talk about anything in particular. But obviously, during the quarter, we believe we had a onetime nonrecurring cost. And as you pointed out, it's worth about 22 basis points of SG&A for just this quarter.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Wewer (Analysts)】\nAnd then the final question for Bill Rhodes. When you think about the benefits of the drop in gasoline prices compared to the headwind from the favorable weather last year, which wins in that tug-of-war.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nI'm sorry, do you [indiscernible] at the end, Dan.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Wewer (Analysts)】\nYes. Which is going to be the most relevant, the benefit from the drop in gasoline prices or the headwind from the more difficult sales comparisons from the ideal weather last year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nYes. Clearly, we had terrific performance last year in the second quarter. We saw in specific categories, the weather-related categories performed exceedingly well. However, some of the other categories did not perform well. We talked about that last year in the second quarter. So it's going to be -- the weather is going to be what it's going to be. There's not a material of changes that we need to make to our business. So we're going to just go up and slug it up the best we can. On gas prices, they really dropped precipitously just recently, and we think we're beginning to see some of the benefits. I expect the benefits to be bigger over time if they remain at these levels or even go lower. And as far as trying to compare the 2, I think you're -- you have just as good insight from that as I do.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Aram Rubinson (Analysts)】\nA couple of really good questions already asked. I just want to kind of tie it towards the cash flow, if we can. I think back in 2012, you reduced your share counts by 9%, then the following year by 8%, then the following year by 7%. And this year, we're kind of at 5.5%. So what I'm wondering is where do that go and implicit in there, as where does CapEx need to go to accommodate these investments that you got on the docket?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Giles (Executives)】\nYes, I think that's a good question. I think -- so if you look at it over the last several years, we obviously had some benefits on working capital improvement when you look at AP to inventory. And as we've kind of headlined over the last several quarters that we feel great about where we are from an AP-to-inventory ratio well over 100%, we think there are some moderate opportunities for us to continue to improve AP to inventory, but we do not anticipate having a kind of increases in AP to inventory going forward that we experienced over the last several years. Some of that attributed to helping us from a share repurchase perspective. I think relative to capital investments in terms of distributions, et cetera, as Bill mentioned, we may add 2 to 3 distribution centers over the next several years. And we still have work to do to determine whether we -- when we will do it, how many we will do, et cetera. But also keep in mind that we would have added 1 or 2 distribution centers over time anyway just to support our footprint across the United States. I mean, you can clearly get out a map and see that we really don't have a lot of distribution capabilities necessarily in the Northwest relative to the amount of stores that we've opened over the last 5 years. So some of that is inherent in our model overall. So we'll give you a little bit more color on the inventory initiative over the next couple of quarters as we finish out the test and have a better plan. I think from a share repurchase perspective, we think we're in a pretty good position right now, and we'll continue to seek opportunities to improve working capital. But I think that's kind of the gap that you've seen over the last several years.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Aram Rubinson (Analysts)】\nWithout giving us a number, can you tell us where you might have a flex room inside of CapEx, if you did decide to step it up on the DC side? What things might be able to come out to accommodate it?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Giles (Executives)】\nI'm sure there are some things in there. Nothing significant that sticks out at the moment. I mean, the one thing for sure that we want to make sure that we're doing is looking down the road. So we're going to continue to make sure that we're making information system investments in order to support our growth long term, both domestically and internationally. We're very diligent about, according to our pledge, making sure that our stores look great. And we're going to continue to invest in our maintenance and training of our AutoZoners. So there will be opportunities for us to tweak the CapEx a little bit, but we will definitely have some costs relative to distribution centers.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Maximillian Aggrey (Analysts)】\nThis is Max Aggrey on for Michael Lasser. How far do you think your current inventory initiatives can take you in closing the commercial sales per program gap with your peers?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nI think it's too early for us to tell. As I mentioned, our performance so far, everything is performing well, but there's a pretty wide band of how they're performing. I also think it's going to take time just because we improve inventory availability. It's going to take us time to further deepen those relationships with our commercial customers. I think we're doing a lot of great things in our commercial business, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks. We've grown commercial double digits for 5 straight quarters, and I think that's pretty impressive. Hopefully, we can continue to do that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Maximillian Aggrey (Analysts)】\nAlso, just kind of as a follow-up, can you maybe mention some of the cannibalization that you're seeing from your younger programs at all?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Giles (Executives)】\nWe can internally. We don't necessarily discuss it externally. I think the key is to focus on for this quarter is that we've obviously improved the productivity of our commercial programs on an average weekly sale basis, which is one of the ways we measure it from $8,500 versus $8,300 last year. We're seeing a high single-digit growth out of our mature programs, so we feel pretty good about the programs as they mature. And we recognize that 30% of our overall programs are 3 years old or younger. And so there will continue to be some cannibalization on those more from just transferring mature customers around. But overall, we feel pretty good about the growth rates that we've achieved on commercial, and we feel pretty great about the trend rates that we've seen on commercial.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Seth Basham (Analysts)】\nYou guys had same-store sales accelerate 240 basis points from 4Q to 1Q. Can you try to break down the drivers of that acceleration between inventory availability, weather, industry growth, et cetera?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Giles (Executives)】\nOne of the things we thought that weather was probably worth around 1 point or so. And I think from a gas perspective or lower fuel costs, as Bill mentioned before, a lot of that happened late in the quarter. So I suspect that, that benefited some. So x those items, and I think the progression that you saw from comp store sales is really a result of a lot of the initiatives that we put in place. And we think back on inventory optimization, the algorithms that we changed, adding more inventory into the stores, et cetera, and now that baked itself for just about a little over a year now. We feel pretty good about that. And as Bill mentioned before, many of these initiatives, it's going to take time for the customers to recognize the changes that we've made. And so that inventory optimization is a great example of one where it took several months, and now we believe that we're starting to see some benefits baked into our results.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Seth Basham (Analysts)】\nGot it. As you look forward, obviously, you don't provide guidance, but from the outside in -- should we be thinking about sort of consistent 2-year stack comps for the next couple of quarters?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Giles (Executives)】\nYes, I think we don't really look at it that way. We're kind of looking at how we're doing right now this past quarter and what do we have in front of us. And as Bill mentioned before, clearly, this next quarter has a high comp because we have some severe weather. And that impacted a lot of failure-related categories in a lot of the Northeast markets. At the same time, there a lot of maintenance categories that underperformed, and there were markets outside of the Northeast that underperformed. So we have to wait and see how it all shakes out. We think that there's opportunities from a category and a region perspective. And if gas prices stay down, that can only be helpful.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Seth Basham (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then lastly on deflation. Would you expect to see more deflation earnings to your business with oil prices down, impact on oil and chemicals, specifically, as well as products with steel input.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Giles (Executives)】\nIntellectually, a little bit, we would expect to see some deflation, but we haven't seen it yet. So there's been a little bit of deflation on oil. There are other categories that have experienced some inflation. So on the whole, we've seen a relatively benign inflation or deflation in total. We'll have to wait and see how it does shake out. Right now, we don't really see a big change.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matthew Fassler (Analysts)】\nI want to start up by focusing, if we could, on SG&A. Even when we isolate out the 2 discrete items that you called out, health care and legal, the growth rate in SG&A looks to have picked up a bit. And I guess just slightly from where you were earlier in the year. How should we think about your expense comparisons going forward? And how much discretionary investment would you say was embedded in the underlying SG&A number here in the November quarter?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Giles (Executives)】\nYes, I think it's a good question, Matt. I think that, obviously, we had the legal, we had insurance plus some IMC cost in there that we didn't call out, x those things out, should probably be flat SG&A rate year-over-year, but you have a 4.5 comp. So you would expect to have had some leverage on SG&A above that. And I would think that the way to think through that is we've probably had a little bit from a discretionary perspective and not so much discretionary as these inventory initiatives, although we haven't quantified them. They are a little bit of a headwind from an operating cost perspective, and we would expect those to continue over the next couple of quarters as we continue to test those out. So there are some dollars in there. I'm not going to quantify exactly what the percentages are, but I think we kind of ran a flattish for the quarter, if you will, when you back out some of those items and then probably had a little bit of investments on our initiatives.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matthew Fassler (Analysts)】\nAnd just to follow that through a little bit, you've had a track record over the past couple of years of tightening your belts a bit when the business has been tough as with the case in your fiscal '13 and then investing a bit more when the business has been better. So because you did that last year, your expense compare looks easy, if you will, just given that you have the -- some sizable increases. Should we consider then perhaps that the compare might be easy, but the investments should persist into the middle of this year, given the supply chain dynamics or supply chain investments remain very much underway?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Giles (Executives)】\nExactly right.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matthew Fassler (Analysts)】\nAnd then a follow-up. I was just trying to work with some of the numbers you gave us to understand the intrinsic profitability of IMC today and where it could be headed. So presuming that it's about 1.5% of the business pro forma, you talked about a 30 basis point drag on gross margin, I believe you talked about the 10 basis point drag going forward on SG&A. Should that spell out something like a mid-single digit operating margin for that business as we speak?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Giles (Executives)】\nI would say not as we speak. I think we think of them in a growth mode. And so they've got some immature businesses. We're going to continue to invest in those businesses, et cetera. And so we will need to improve the profitability of IMC. And then more importantly, we also need to, over time, help our own commercial customers through IMC products.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matthew Fassler (Analysts)】\nAnd I know it's a small business, but given that, it's sort of tough to get a precise number. Would you say that business is in the black today? Just to get clear on that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Giles (Executives)】\nNo. To be clear on that, Matt, just not to talk around it. It's at a slight loss.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matthew Fassler (Analysts)】\nGot it. And the profit potential of that model over time, as you think about the intrinsic gross margins and term potential, et cetera.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Giles (Executives)】\nYes, I would say that's probably closer to what you were thinking before, which is probably a mid-single digit kind of a number, but the bigger opportunity will be the broader base.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gregory Melich (Analysts)】\nI have a couple of follow-ups, I think. One was on the sequential improvement in the comp trend. How much of that was -- I heard traffic was still a little bit negative, but how much of that sequential improvement was traffic versus ticket?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nI think it was both and I talked about it earlier. The ticket front for about last year or so, it's been really been continuing to grow. It's been subdued. And that trend changed back to kind of normalized trends this quarter. The traffic also improved. As we're looking and talking about the acceleration from Q4, I'll also remind us all that nobody was really happy with Q4. And remember that July was really poor and August was poor as well. So that wasn't necessarily the baseline, if you will.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gregory Melich (Analysts)】\nOkay, great. And then just to understand a little bit more about -- I think I heard in the prepared comments that you had lower product acquisition cost. What's driving that? And if you think about it going forward, I think you mentioned inflation just doesn't back it all. Do you think there's actually some deflation likely to come in into next year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Giles (Executives)】\nYes, I think that -- I think our merchandising organization continues to do a great job both in identifying new vendors for existing product where we can reduce our cost and direct import opportunities overseas, doing things directly or finding new vendors overseas as well. So I think the merchandising organization has done a great job from lowering our acquisition cost. Haven't seen in total a lot of deflation necessarily, but we haven't seen inflation either obviously. Going forward right now, our expectation is that there won't be much deflation or inflation, but clearly in some categories, we expect there'll be a little bit of deflation. So I think overall, that would be relatively flat.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gregory Melich (Analysts)】\nAnd remind us where are you now in terms of direct imports as a percentage or...\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Giles (Executives)】\nIt's not a significant percent. It's certainly well below 20%.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gregory Melich (Analysts)】\nOkay. And Duralast, do you have a number for that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Giles (Executives)】\nOur family brand of products, the Valucraft, Duralast, Duralast Gold products, our Cmax represent just over 50% of our overall sales.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nYes, before we conclude the call, I'd like to take a moment to reiterate that we have a long and strong heritage of consistent impressive performance. While we are excited about our growth prospects for the year, we will not take anything for granted, as we understand our customers have choices. We have a solid plan to succeed this fiscal year, but I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long-term shareholder value, we are confident AutoZone will continue to be very successful.\r\nThank you for participating in today's call, and we'd like to wish everyone a very happy and healthy holiday season and a prosperous new year.

      "transcript_text1": "Good morning, everyone. I need you to take your seats really quickly. We'll get started here. Well, good morning, everyone. Thank you for braving the New York weather and coming to join us today. It's -- we're obviously based in Kansas City, where it's a balmy 55 degrees and sunny today. So I apologize for not bringing that up here with us. My name is Colby Brown. I'm the Vice President of Investor Relations. On behalf of the entire H&R Block management team, it's my pleasure to welcome all of you here as well as those of you participating via the webcast to H&R Block's December 2014 Investor Conference. We have an informative and exciting day planned and are glad you're able to join us. \r\nBefore we get started, we have a few housekeeping items to take care of. Yesterday, we released our fiscal 2015 second quarter results. That release, as well as today's presentation, includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. We reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP figures in the schedules attached to the press release, and you can find both the release and the schedules on our Investor Relations web page at hrblock.com. \r\nI'd also like to remind everyone that today's presentation and various comments made in connection with it will include forward-looking statements as defined under the securities laws. Such statements are based on current information and management's expectations as of this date and are not guarantees of future performance.\r\nForward-looking statements involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Thus, our actual and results could differ materially. You can learn more about these risks in our Form 10-K for fiscal 2014 and our other SEC filings. H&R Block undertakes no obligation to publicly update these risk factors or forward-looking statements.\r\nShortly after this morning's presentation is concluded, we'll post the slides on our website. And later this week, as a reminder, our webcast will be available for replay. To give you a sense of the agenda for today, opening presentations will run until approximately 10:00 Eastern. We'll then take a 15-minute break. Refreshments will be available throughout the morning. And a quick logistical note, restrooms are out the door and to your right. We then expect the Q&A to begin around 11:30 Eastern. So again, welcome, everyone. We're excited that you're here. Thank you for coming and we hope you enjoy the presentations.\r\n[Presentation]\n\n---\n\nGood morning, everybody. I want to thank CNN for my star turn, my little 4 minutes of fame. But I want to welcome you to this year's investor conference. We are pleased to have you join us. We'll review our fiscal 2014 performance and share with you where we see our opportunities for this coming tax season and beyond. \r\nSo today, we will share with you a recap of our performance in fiscal 2014, the opportunities we see going forward and why we believe we're well positioned to drive value for our shareholders. But first, I want to address the elephant in the room, so to speak, and that is a few words about the bank.\r\nSo we've had some people asked, \"Why are you even doing an investor conference this year?\" The thinking being that the bank divestiture is incomplete and we have nothing else to talk about. Now we did think we'd be done in time for this tax season. And as you know, we're still waiting for a decision from the regulators. But to be absolutely clear, we remain committed to divesting our bank and we expect BofI to be a solid partner. The regulators said that they needed more time. Like I said back in October, we can scratch our heads all we want. But they have been very thorough, extremely professional and we're going to take them at their word. We still believe that, on its merits, this transaction will be approved. \r\nSo the truth is we're holding this conference because we have a lot of great things to tell you. And at the end of the day, if anything is crystal clear, I hope it's what I firmly believe to be true: That no one understands taxes like we do, no one understands the industry like we do and, most importantly, no one understands the behaviors and needs of our clients like we do. So with that as a foundation, I'm going to start off with an overview, then the other presentations will provide the deeper context. \r\nAs most of you already know, we're the world's largest tax preparer. We're entering our 60th tax season here in the U.S., got over $3 billion in global revenue in fiscal 2014, which is more than all of our branded competitors, assisted and digital combined. \r\nSince 1955, we've filed over 650 million tax returns. And this past season, we filed over 24 million returns worldwide. And that's across more than 10,000 offices globally staffed by tens of thousands of tax professionals and associates worldwide. Clearly, Americans know us, use us and love us. We file 1 in every 7 U.S. tax returns. In fact, if you count all the branded tax preparers who sign their clients' tax returns, H&R Block tax pros signed 7 out of 10 of all these. Why? Because Americans know we are the most knowledgeable, the most accessible in the industry and we'll do their taxes right. And that value is delivered by our tax pros and associates who are the best in the industry. \r\nOur tax pros have an average tenure of 8 years and over 450 hours of training. We have over 7,500 enrolled agents, the highest credential awarded by the IRS. We have CPAs. We have attorneys. Over 1/3 of our tax pros have achieved certification as an H&R Block master tax adviser, which is our highest internal credential. Our tax pros are experts who go well beyond just simply answering tax questions. They are advisers to our clients. They prepare and sign our clients' returns and that's a very personal connection. \r\nAnd while our history is founded in assisted tax preparation, we're also making quite an impact on the DIY side. We've come a long way from our earlier DIY products to today's innovative and redesigned software that positions us well for the future. And while we are proud of our accomplishments here in the U.S., we're also proud of our global operations. This coming season, we're celebrating our 51st year in Canada. And at the end of October, we completed our 44th tax season in Australia, including the launch of a new DIY product there. \r\nAnd as many of you know, we entered India and Brazil a few years ago. We also have an emerging ex-pat business. And a point you may not be aware of, we have 28 tax offices on or near U.S. military bases around the world serving our armed forces. None of our competitors can say that. \r\nSo now let's take a closer look at our performance this past fiscal year. Strong execution in 2014 based on our Tax Plus revenue growth strategy drove increased revenue, productivity and profitability. Total revenues rose $118 million, up 4% to over $3 billion. Complementing this revenue growth, EBITDA increased 8% to $940 million, which is an improvement of 24% since fiscal 2012. In fact, EBITDA margin grew 1 point to 31% of revenues in fiscal 2014. \r\nOverall, we continue to focus on driving profitable growth in assisted and digital and in our adjacent Tax Plus products. \r\nIn assisted, we maintained our strong focus on clients. We prepared and filed 13.6 million U.S. returns, which was 17% of the assisted category. In digital, we saw double-digit growth in revenue. And although our growth in return count slowed, our strong execution and conversion and monetization led to this growth, marking the fourth year in a row now we've gained revenue share. And in a rapidly maturing industry, we think that's a very important measurement. \r\nAnd we saw a continuing progress with our Tax Plus strategy, which improves client service by offering integrated adjacent products. \r\nIn 2014, revenues from our Tax Plus products increased 11% to $432 million. I'll talk about the performance of our Tax Plus products in more detail later this morning. But 2 key points here are that the tax preparation business and adjacent financial services products are clearly synergistic, which keeps our cost of acquisition low. \r\nPlus, these best-in-class products enhance the relationship with our clients, many of whom have come to trust and rely on these products year after year. All of this translates into driving value for our shareholders. In fiscal year 2014, free cash flow before dividends increased 73% to $663 million. Earnings per share last year increased 5% to $1.67. And in January, we will pay our 209th consecutive quarterly dividend. That's over 52 years and counting. \r\nAnd since I took over as CEO in May of 2011, we have returned $1.2 billion to our shareholders in share repurchases and dividends. This, despite, as many of you know, being prohibited from buying back shares since the summer of 2012. So we are pleased with our performance in 2014. Our direction is even clearer now as we've shed non-core businesses and are focused on tax preparation as our core competency. \r\nAnd as the #1 player in the tax preparation industry, it's also our role to lead the industry, to advocate for and to lead change that best serves the interest of taxpayers. You've heard me say that we don't take partisan positions on the tax code. Our job is simple. Do everything we can to ensure our clients receive the maximum refund to which they are entitled and to keep them out of trouble. \r\nBut that doesn't mean we shouldn't, as the industry leader, educate policymakers on tax administration. And there are 2 tax administration issues that need to be addressed. The first is the issue of improper earned income credit payments. In its most recent report this year, the IRS estimated that there were $16 billion to $19 billion in improper EIC payments, either as a result of fraud or complexity due to honest taxpayer mistakes, $16 billion to $19 billion. And we know this improper payment rate, as a percentage of total EIC filings, has been over 20% for the past 10 years and estimates for 2014 range between 24% and 29% of total EIC filings. \r\nWe also know that, among those applying for the EIC, there's been a significant migration from assisted to digital. This graph shows that the percent of those applying for the EIC who prepare and file their taxes digitally has grown from 28% in 2008 to 42% this past tax season. Why? I suspect, for some at least, it's because they don't have to answer as many questions to document their eligibility and we know there are some unscrupulous paid preparers who use off-the-shelf software to avoid the added scrutiny of answering additional questions and their potential liability because they don't have to sign the return. It makes no sense to have different documentation requirements. No sense at all. So we think that across all channels, all EIC filers, whether assisted or digital, should have to answer the same questions. Doing so would significantly reduce fraud and criminal activity, and we have told the treasury department that it needs to take action because the current policy makes no sense.\r\nThe second tax administration issue is the lack of minimum standards for paid tax preparers. Currently, there are no federal standards in place, and only 4 states have such standards. In August of 2011, the IRS proposed new testing and continuing education requirements for tax preparers. But that's now on hold until it finds its way through Congress. So this year, the IRS implemented a new voluntary program. While we would have preferred a mandatory program, we welcome the voluntary program and we'll support Commissioner Koskinen's efforts for legislation to regulate tax return preparers. We continue to believe strongly that America needs genuine certification that includes mandatory testing and continuing education of all paid tax preparers. I've said it before: Cutting hair requires certification in all 50 states. So it surely makes sense that certification of paid tax preparers should be required in all 50 states, too. \r\nAnd while H&R Block continues to lead the way on these 2 issues, the silence of others in this industry is deafening. Frankly, I cannot understand why only H&R Block is talking publicly about these issues. Most of the competition isn't and you should wonder why. It's either because they don't know or they don't care, or is it because doing the right thing will hurt their businesses. \r\nSo now let's get onto our lineup of speakers and the topics they're going to discuss this morning. First up, Kathy Collins, our Chief Marketing Officer. Her team has done extensive new research on consumer tax filing behavior, which she will share with you. \r\nNext up and playing hurt today -- these 40 -year-olds who are in great shape, they just can't get it together, but with a very -- a severely sore neck -- Jason Houseworth, our President of Global Digital and Product Management, he'll talk to you about the opportunities in the digital category. \r\nThen Shawn Moore, our Vice President of Development and Franchise Strategy, will break down the structure of the assisted tax preparation category. You'll get a better understanding of just how fragmented this industry is and Shawn will provide our insights. \r\nAfter Shawn, I'll be back to talk to you about investments in our core retail business, in technology, the look and feel of our offices and what's next for our Tax Plus products. \r\nWe'll then take a break. And near the end of the morning, we'll have the 2 presenters you're probably most anxious to hear. Mark Ciaramitaro, our Vice President of New Business and Innovation, is one of the most knowledgeable people in the country on healthcare. He'll talk to you about the impact of the Affordable Care Act on taxes. I believe we've committed more resources to this initiative than anyone in the tax industry, and Mark will show you what we know, what we anticipate and what we're doing in the space. \r\nAnd then finally, Greg Macfarlane, our CFO, will talk to you about our overall financial outlook. Greg will synthesize everything you hear today into a cohesive investment thesis for Block. So that's our lineup. \r\nI'm going to close now with something that speaks to the essence of who H&R Block is, and I think it's truly the most important thing I've done since becoming CEO, and that's to define what guides us, our purpose, our vision and our values. Simply put, our purpose is to look at your life through tax and find ways to help. It all begins with taxes and how we look at life through the lens of tax. Only H&R Block does this. \r\nFrom there, our vision. The carefully chosen words of our vision make clear that we are the leading global consumer tax company, bringing tax and related solutions to clients year-round. But to have purpose and realize the vision, we also have to be grounded in values. We do the right thing, simple and clear. I hear it echoed in meetings across the organization as teams address opportunities and challenges. And to do the right thing means we believe in our people, we take care of our clients and we deliver for our shareholders. We pride ourselves on doing the right thing. And that includes our absolute commitment to creating additional value in this company. We're proud of our track record. Since May of 2011, our market value has more than doubled. Free cash flow was up significantly, and share buybacks and dividends have exceeded $1.2 billion. But we believe more value creation is on the horizon, and that horizon includes exiting our bank. \r\nAnd on that point, I do want to thank everyone here for your patience. I'm sure this hasn't been easy for you. I know it hasn't been easy for us. But we remain confident we're going to get this done and create even more value in this great company going forward. So with that, let's get on with the rest of the presentations.\r\n[Presentation]\n\n---\n\nGood morning. I'm Kathy Collins. I am the Chief Marketing Officer at H&R Block. And today, I'm going to share an evolved perspective of the tax industry through the eyes of the consumer and how our understanding of that perspective is reshaping how we approach the market today. As I thought about our approach, I wanted to start by addressing key questions floating around the tax category. Is consumer behavior changing? Has the complexity of the tax code changed how we think about filing our taxes? Are people moving to DIY as mobile devices become a way of life or to save money? Is the H&R Block retail model still relevant? \r\nAs the leader in the tax preparation industry, we know this category better than anyone. In fact, we spend a great deal of time trying to truly understand the issues and questions that I just mentioned. So I plan to spend the next few minutes sharing with you our perspectives and what we have learned as we've studied the answers to these and other questions. \r\nFirst, let's set the stage. The tax prep industry is one of steady, but slow return growth, around 1% to 2% per year. And as you know, there is great diversity in competitors throughout the tax prep industry, with a large number of competitors in the retail category and fewer participants in the DIY category. Now Shawn and Jason are going to spend more time on the structure of the categories a little later, but I really want to focus on the consumer. \r\nH&R Block is, by far, the largest brand participating fully in 100% of the tax market. From assisted tax prep to do-it-yourself and anything in between, we serve clients the way they want to be served. Now what we've learned about the industry over the years may surprise you. For one, we have learned the decisions around tax prep are highly emotional for consumers. For many, it is the largest financial transaction of their year. It may trigger excitement or nervous, reluctance but typically, a high level of anxiety. \r\nSo as a brand, we must understand the needs that drive their behaviors so we can deliver flawlessly for consumers. But who are these consumers? What is driving their behavior? And how can a brand like H&R Block continue to grow in a slow-growing, seemingly un-innovative environment? \r\nAs the leader in tax, we took it upon ourselves to take a fresh look at the industry. We embarked on a long-term consumer research journey, which included a very large in-depth, qualitative and quantitative analysis of over 8,700 tax filers' behavior, attitudes and needs. Why did we do this? Well, at H&R Block, we love our data, but I wanted to leverage that data to an evolved level, to a level where we knew what the client's next move would be, maybe before he knew it himself. For starters, we really need to understand what outcomes consumers desire. What exactly do they want from their tax preparation provider? How do they then cluster together into viable marketable segments based on their needs? And then how do we market to them according to those needs?\r\nBefore launching this research, we took pride in knowing a great deal about all tax consumers. Everyone wants expertise. Everyone wants convenience and everyone wants a low price, right? Every piece of research that's ever been done will validate those points. But because of our experience, we know that there was more to it. \r\nAt H&R Block, we invest to better understand the entire spectrum of tax filers. Our digital competitors are focused on those who do it themselves. CPAs and independents simply cannot look at the whole category to this level of detail. And our branded retail competitors, they just haven't. But H&R Block has, with the simple objective of uncovering what drives growth in this industry. \r\nAll of this began with one simple insightful question. What tax jobs are consumers trying to buy? The #1 job that consumers want to buy is getting the largest refund. While it may be surprising to you, but about 86% of all H&R Block clients across all income levels receive a refund. In fact, getting a refund does not depend on income level. Now it's obvious that lower income filers are almost certain to receive a refund. But even at income levels up to $180,000, nearly 1/2 of H&R Block filers receive a tax refund. This is why last year's ad campaign, Get Your Billion Back America, featuring 1 of our own tax pros, Richard Gartland, was so effective for us. It was a broad message. It impacts everyone regardless of age, income or even needs-based segmentation. \r\nWithin just 4 weeks of that campaign -- starting that campaign, over 75% of American taxpayers knew the tagline. 90% of them tied it instantly back to H&R Block. Once again, because the idea of the largest refund unites all taxpayers. \r\nThere are other uniters. Everybody wants accuracy of return, security of their tax documents, being treated with respect. These outcomes are universal. They are important to everyone. But it's the differences among taxpayers that lead us to more targeted growth ideas. \r\nSo let me tell you about what some of those drivers are. The first true differentiator among consumers when it comes to tax prep is whether or not they want to buy help. That is whether or not they want assistance with their tax prep. Our study showed that 65% of all tax filers do want assistance when completing their taxes. This is a number very consistent with actual return data. The entire universe of taxpayers not rushing out to do it themselves, far from it. The perception of one's own ability is one of the most discriminating factors in our learnings. It had the most variance. \r\nWhile some are confident in their own abilities to file their own taxes and get the largest refund, most are not. And this number really has not changed all that much over time. In fact, historical filing patterns over the past 15 years showed that nearly 60% of the market utilizes assisted tax prep, while right around 40% does it on their own. But 90% of the total tax category revenues come from assisted tax prep, while just 10% from DIY programs. \r\nBottom line, the research tells us there is great consumer demand for assisted tax prep. The H&R Block business model is alive and well. It also reinforces that we need more targeted approaches based on consumer needs. So this is where the real work begins. \r\nThink about the universe of tax filers. 135 million taxees and filers. A closer look at them reveal the variety of segments. Each of these segments cluster clients who are looking for the same outcomes. Each segment is based on specific needs of consumers. Some of those needs are being met today, some are not. Now it's important to remember that H&R Block fully participates in every segment of the tax prep market. Our competitors likely participate in 1 or 2 of these segments. And while I'm not going to walk you through all of the segments and all of the detail, I'm going to highlight some of the behaviors that influence tax filers and some key learnings from our work. \r\nSo let's start with Jose. Jose is representative of the client who values speed and convenience above everything else. So Jose desires a shorter appointment length with little need for the relationship aspect of tax prep. He may be more cash strapped than other consumers. We can then customize the interview for Jose and the offering. First of all, we schedule Jose for 30 minutes as opposed to an hour. If we are running at all behind, we shoot him a text message to keep him updated. We welcome him and jump right into the interview. We eliminate any tax planning tips and we save those for his summary statement. And finally, we remind Jose of our no out-of-pocket payment option, which allows his tax prep fees to be deducted from his refund. So Jose walks out of the office having all of his needs met: convenience, maximum refund, tax expertise and paying nothing out of pocket. \r\nNow those filers that tend to complete their taxes later in the season are even more differentiated. Let's assume that Lori and Dan are in this later season segment. They are among the few who owe money to the IRS as opposed to expecting a refund. Their situation is more complex. They're waiting for financial statements and gathering all of their paperwork up until the very last minute. In their minds, only an enrolled agent will do. They view their situation as being too complex for just anyone to handle and there is no way either one of them will tackle this challenge on their own. Consumers like Lori and Dan expect their tax preparer to know everything about them. If anything material has changed in their lives, he will know that. They expect him to call them, pass on any reminders and find a time that one or both of them can come in and drop off their stack of documents. So Lori will walk in the office, she'll answer a few questions, hand over the goods and wait for the call that says, \"They're done.\" Now she will anticipate some forward-looking tax tips from her tax guy.\r\nLet's look at 1 more filer who is part of a group clearly differentiated by confidence and convenience. Stephanie is a DIY-er. She is confident in our own ability to complete her tax return. She doesn't mind the challenge and feels that it is worth the time and effort. After all, for Stephanie and others like her in this segment, it's all about the lowest price. She simply believes that it is too expensive to pay someone else to do her taxes and she wants to invest as little as possible to get this job done. She also doesn't believe that the risk of preparing her own taxes is any greater than having someone else do them. She loves the sense of accomplishment she feels when she does complete the task. Now we know that Stephanie may reach a point of uncertainty while completing her own taxes, so we may pop up some sort of a window with a relevant tax tip or an invitation to chat with a tax professional during her interview process. And while there is a lot of inertia in the tax prep category, about 86% of all filers return to the same tax prep method they used the year prior. People do not always stay within 1 segment. There is some movement. Even the largest DIY player in the industry sees about 25% of their clients leave every year. That movement is typically the result of a life event or a life stage change. In the most general terms, complexity sparks uncertainty and uncertainty may drive filers to a tax professional. \r\nSo let's see how this all plays out over the life of a taxpayer. A 21-year-old starting out oftentimes looks for assistance from his parents from the -- for the right tax prep method. After a few years, he may try DIY, trusting in his own abilities to get the job done. As that young adult ages, life gets more complex. By 40, they have marriage, kids, homeownership, oftentimes, new jobs or even their own business. By 60, they may have divorce or death of a spouse and they've hit their peak income. They likely have some investments. Their tax complexity is still high, but will soon start to drop off. So taxpayers may switch segments a couple of times throughout their lives. \r\nSo you and as investors may be saying, \"So what?\" Here's the so what in all of these. At H&R Block, we understand client needs unlike anyone else in the industry. We have all this data. We know what people want. And now we have to bring it to life. Consumers expect more today, so we must use tools and practices to reach them directly, the right way. So the beauty of having all of these data, this in-depth understanding of our clients is that we have now typed our database. What does that mean? It means that we have assigned a segment designation to every consumer in our database based on a proprietary algorithm. From there, we are able to customize every client experience as well as our marketing initiatives. And what's even more powerful for client growth, our algorithm can be applied to people who are not yet our clients as well.\r\nPreviously, we were only able to use those records to identify clients based on age, income or tax forms filed. He's a 1040. She's a younger 1040EZ. The problem with that, demographics and forms are not indicative of behavior. To complement this consumer intelligence, we have also invested significantly in our own new CRM, customer relationship management system through both campaign managements and real-time decision-making. So with every person in our database, we maintain a golden record of that person; who he is, what segment he falls into, how he has responded to marketing stimulus, et cetera. \r\nSo for those who have opted in for a more personalized approach to marketing, we're excited about some of the new capabilities that are brought to life in the following examples: Our targeted marketing initiatives become, in some cases, as simple as a single keystroke, where, for example, clients will receive a product offer via e-mail at a discounted price the week they receive their W-2s, all based on past behavior. We can then tie those consumer segment needs right back to our marketing plans. \r\nSo here's how I look at our marketing structure at H&R Block. First, we have our national strategy. We build our story around what we can own and what is most relevant to our consumers. We call this air cover, which is primarily broadcast as well as screen cover, our interactive marketing initiatives. These 2, air cover and screen cover, are our version of mass marketing. \r\nLast year, our air cover was around getting the greatest refund, Get Your Billion Back America. It's about who we are as a brand, what we can deliver and what makes us better. The second level of marketing is what we call win the block. This is our local marketing approach that focuses on single-mindedly driving consumers into our local offices. \r\nAnd the final level is what I've been talking about today. We are now able to leverage the data with a more customized direct-to-consumer approach. We target our clients with the right message, in the right channel at the right time. So for example, Lori and Dan, that I spoke of, we know they are late-season filers. We shoot them an e-mail newsletter that speaks specifically about relevant tax tips. We can go even deeper and target those being impacted by a new tax code change with a very specific message about what it means to him or her. Another example, for the Joses that I told you about, we will introduce a geo-targeted mobile advertisements and alerts because we know this segment is most reliant on their mobile devices. \r\nAnd let's look at my earlier example of Stephanie, our DIY-er. She files in early February each year. And if we noticed that she hasn't filed by February 10, we can send her an e-mail, possibly a discount offer, to remind her that we are the right brand for her and we have the product that best meets her needs.\r\nH&R Block invented and has evolved the tax industry, which is alive and thriving 60 years later. What I've talked about today, it's a work in progress, it's an evolution, but we will continue to innovate. We will test and learn. And by understanding more about our clients than anyone else, we're positioned to do just that. Thanks for your time.\r\n[Presentation]\n\n---\n\nGood morning. I'm Jason Houseworth, President of Global Digital Tax Solutions and Product Management. My role is to create great experiences for our tax clients, starting with our digital tax business as well as leading the client experience for all of our tax products in my dual role as Head of Product Management. Today, I plan on providing you with a brief scorecard summarizing tax season '14, before discussing the evolution of the DIY category, finishing with my perspective on what it will take to lead in digital. \r\nSo let's begin by walking through our scorecard for the digital business in tax season 2014, a year highlighted by double-digit Tax Plus revenue growth, which was our primary objective for the year. The one in which we did not move the needle in terms of top of the funnel awareness that H&R Block makes tax software and therefore we saw little client growth. Growing awareness continues to be our #1 opportunity as a business. And as discussed at last year's investor conference, we launched year 1 of our product redesign last season, the first in a wave of changes that will literally change every 1 of our 6,000-page federal and state online products. Obviously, a big undertaking, but one that I believe couldn't have gone better. We improved conversion and we saw our contact rate or the percentage of contacts per registered unit materially drop. But the most important result of the redesign was the monetization we saw driving our double-digit revenue growth. I mentioned last year, during our investor conference, that we believe the redesign would improve the value perception a user has within the experience and we saw this result as a validation of our product innovation and testing process. \r\nHowever, it was only Phase 1. While mobile usage continues to explode, Phase 2 will ensure that every single page will be responsive. That is to say it will appear as if it was designed for the respective Smartphone or tablet device. This is clearly an opportunity, given our conversion on both of these devices dramatically trails our desktop and laptop results. \r\nI'll talk more about the importance of adapting all of our pages to be responsive later. But first, I'd like to talk to you about the do-it-yourself or DIY category. And as Kathy just referenced, this is the 40% of the overall tax market that says, \"I'll do it myself.\" And that's versus the 60% of assisted filers, who prefer having someone help prepare their taxes. Now the DIY category is where I'm focused on serving and, unlike assisted, is one that has involved significantly over the past 20 years. \r\nToday, I'm going to review how DIY, as a category, has evolved, where we've been and where we are headed, along with what it will take to lead going forward. \r\nI'm going to start back when DIY was nearly all pen and paper in 1992; a time at which the category had roughly 55 million taxees and returns. Desktop was the first major shift, and its emergence for use in tax preparation was recognized by Intuit and H&R Block, with Intuit buying Chipsoft, the father of Turbotax; and H&R Block acquiring TaxCut. \r\nDesktop software not only created the ability for DIY-ers to electronically file a return, it also simplified tax form completion through an interview-based approach rather than direct form entry. And as a result, by 1995, it had over 5 million users. \r\nAs the Internet emerged, tax filing shifted to follow. TaxACT was the first tax software to be primarily available online and it was the first to leverage freemium, the try-before-you-buy-it model, which gave even the reluctant DIY-er the ability to go and at least double check their work online for free. \r\nIn 2002, companies in the tax software category formed what is known as the Free File Alliance, or FFA, in order to provide low- to moderate-income taxpayers, the ability to file a federal return for free through the irs.gov website. This also had an unintended consequence of giving rise to a number of .com sites that are what I'll call pen and paper on a web form. Sites that were able to spend just $26,000 for an FFA membership by creating the most basic tax software. You've got form entry, automated the arithmetic previously done by hand, e-filing, but little else. \r\nEven though the federal preparation was free, these sites monetized the service by charging to file a state return. By 2004, online had surpassed desktop with 10 million returns filed using online versus 8 million via desktop. And over the next decade, the growth of online continued, fueled by growth within the DIY category, primarily from pen and paper, but also from desktop users as online moved from the software of choice to the method of choice, for the majority of the DIY-ers, by 2006. \r\nIn the past few years, the growth in online has accelerated due to the shift of Earned Income filers from assisted to DIY. And Bill mentioned this earlier, driven by the inconsistent documentation requirements for assisted versus DIY filing for this credit. \r\nIn online, the credits -- pardon me, the requirements to verify are nowhere close to the stringent requirements that are forced on tax preparers, driving what the treasury's own data has reported as a $16 billion to $19 billion in improper EIC payments, which leads us to the DIY category today. \r\nNow at 55.9 million DIY tax season returns, online is the overwhelming choice, encompassing what I would call traditional online laptop or desktop users, with a growing pure mobile, and then you've got the multi-channel mobile users, or those who use some combination of mobile and traditional screens. This combined group of online users now contains 40 million returns, or 4x the amount of desktop software returns, leaving only 5 million of the most ardent pen-and-paper returns. \r\nThis number is a stark contrast to the 55 million pen-and-paper returns present in 1992. But it's still roughly the same number of returns for the total DIY category. Despite over 20 years of change, including the introduction of desktop software, online or SaaS-based filing, free and freemium in online, as well as mobile and multi-channel filing. \r\nH&R Block has participated in the rise of the DIY category, nearly since the beginning. But we admittedly came late to innovate in the online space. In 2009, I would argue that we were like many of the small FFA tax solutions I mentioned earlier. We were simply pen and paper on a web form with supporting calculations and electronic filing. However, in 2010, we effectively relaunched our online product, not just with a new name, changing TaxCut to H&R Block, but refocusing our online product on streamline filing, including W-2 and 1099 import, adding audit support and representation for all free and paid products in 2011, becoming multi-channel in 2012 by releasing 8 new mobile apps, establishing MyBlock in 2012, in part to allow users to move seamlessly between assisted and DIY through a technology solution to keep their data and relationship with H&R Block, regardless of channel. And finally, last year, we introduced the first of a 2-year redesign to begin a path of personalization to ensure that the product adapts to each user, as they prepare their taxes online. \r\nThese changes, to refocus our digital business on winning in online, have dramatically improved our registration to conversion by 5 points and resulted in a 17% CAGR in online revenue since 2010. We've repositioned ourselves in preparation for further evolution within the DIY category. \r\nLooking forward, I believe we will see DIY evolve in 2 important ways. The first is how the small value competitors created through the FFA will lose their ability to compete on price alone. Our view is that the even when value DIY-ers expect more than what I would call pen-and-paper as a web form, given that price is no longer a differentiator and they will begin to move upstream. \r\nThe second is that the market leader, who is now using price to level the playing field with the value competitors, is continuing to fund its simple filer pricing by raising price on its most valuable, high net average charge clients. Schedule C and other more complex forms have been moved from basic to deluxe SKUs into premium and home and business SKUs, making this consumer pay $50 more each year. I believe H&R Block is well positioned to take advantage of both of these shifts. \r\nOur rebuilt online offering puts the expertise and tax services of the most of trusted tax advisers, together with innovative, easy-to-use tax software that is built to lead for what's next in the evolution of the DIY category.\r\nIn order to win going forward, tax software or digital category providers will need to acquire and excel at 3 core components. First, product innovation or what I'll more specifically explain as the delivery to the consumer of intelligence as a service. Second, a multi-screen focus to design first for the Smartphone and tablet device. And third, a brand that has awareness and can support the full set of integrated Tax Services consumers expect.\r\nWhen I look at where tax offer will evolve, it's important to start by understanding how technology and software innovation will change in applications used every day by our DIY clients. In these applications, consumers will see software that leverages my data that's in the cloud, as well as information from the network or a shared set of knowledge that exists, that many refer to as big data. \r\nIn order to deliver intelligence as a service, to answer much more complex questions, and a simple example is how Google is going beyond search by proactively offering content like driving time to an upcoming appointment I have on my calendar, weather for the location I'm at right now, and providing me scores for sports teams that I've recently searched. \r\nThis synthesis of custom algorithms, as they apply my situation to an abstract set of shared information, will not only create meaningful solutions to more and more complex consumer problems or questions, but it will also anticipate how and when to do it. The delivery of intelligence as a service will have many applications. And in tax software, it will drive the software to become more personalized. In our case, the personal data is as rich as it gets. It's the individual's tax return and related data. And our shared knowledge is our internal CRM or client database that Kathy mentioned, which has everything from the high-level segment to the detailed clicks that each user takes that provides us with an even more dynamic user typing. \r\nIntelligence as a service advancements will make each user feel that the software was not only designed for them, but is always a step ahead. Tax season '15 will launch year 2 of our product redesign and delivers an example of this by creating a personalized navigation for every returning user. We recognize their unique situation from using the data that they had last year, and then we build an interview that only contains the relevant topics. But this is only scratching the surface when it comes to our usage of intelligence-as-a-service. With our redesign complete, we've now created a technical foundation for a number of these innovations that you'll see release later this year, as well as in the next few tax seasons. \r\nIn addition to developing intelligence-as-a-service, leaders in tax software will need to design the delivery of their software to be multi-screen. We like to say that the rise of video-on-demand has created consumers with an expectation of play, pause and resume. Or it's an expectation that your solution should be one that I can begin at work on my laptop, continue on my tablet at home when I have a few spare minutes and do portions on my Smartphone. \r\nAnother way to look at it would be from a negative perspective, which we saw last year when we still had screens in our program, like this example, that were not designed first for mobile device. \r\nHere you see the same screen ready for tax season 2015, designed from the beginning for a mobile or one-column screen format. For consumers who experienced screens that were suboptimal, we saw a 20 point drop in conversion versus those that spend 100% of the online experience in a full-screen browser. \r\nI'm happy to report that in the upcoming tax season, all 6,000 of our federal and state online product pages will be fully responsive to all devices. Our product will make this look and easy and meet the play, pause, resume expectation of consumers but our view is enabling this and keeping up with the pressure to be multiscreen will be something only the leaders in tax software will be able to do seamlessly. \r\nFinally, with the online category continuing to consolidate value and premium with price no longer a differentiator, I believe that all DIY-ers, not just those seeking a more premium online tax provider, will have a shared expectation that tax expertise and related services, like help from a tax adviser and audit support, are delivered part and parcel, at a great value. \r\nAnd as I said before, we are well positioned for this. Our software is consistently ranked #1 in this area because of our support of live tax experts during the preparation process, and the worry-free audit support and in-person representation all clients receive after filing. \r\nFinally, both value and premium consumer expectations will demand these tax services be built upon a great brand. We believe that with our product improvements in place, our greatest asset, and yet our greatest opportunity is our brand. Awareness that H&R Block makes tax software currently stands at 60%, a number that dwarfs the value competitors because it has taken significant investment to achieve, but by increasing still represents the largest opportunity to challenge the market leader. \r\nSo I hope as you leave, in addition to taking some of the free tax software that's in the back of the room, you take away the following: The DIY category continues to evolve, driven by online, as a multi-screen web experience. The set of online solutions is also evolving as value and premium collapse, creating a sweet spot for H&R Block tax software, given we have the traits necessary to lead going forward. Thank you.\r\n[Video Presentation]\n\n---\n\nGood morning. My name is Shawn Moore, and I'm responsible for identifying competitors that fit into the H&R Block brand and acquiring and integrating those businesses into the H&R Block network. I would like to provide you a unique perspective on the competitive landscape within the assisted tax preparation category that you likely have not seen before. Then I will share with you that same landscape translates to an opportunity for H&R Block. \r\nBut first, let's talk about the overall tax industry. It's a $19 billion market where assisted tax preparation makes up the lion's share. And as Kathy detailed earlier, it's a stable market, largely driven by consumer behavior. Tax filers tend not to change providers, unless there's a significant life event, which leaves the player in this industry space to literally compete on a client-by-client basis. But against whom are we competing? As you can see here, there are only a few branded competitors in the category. We certainly pay attention to what they're doing. But quite frankly, they are not the greatest threats to our market share. The CPAs and independents combined, have 78% of the assisted market. Clearly, the largest share, and thus, representing our greatest competition. And if you break it down even further, although our brand can stretch to capture share from CPAs, our true competitors are the independents, the mom and pops of the industry. This is where we invest a lot of our time and energy. \r\nSo let's talk a little bit more about just who these independents are. You may not have noticed this, but you see these types of offices every day as you drive down the street. As you know, there are very low barriers of entry to the tax preparation industry. Combine that with the fact that it's a lucrative transaction, and it is no wonder the independent market has a multitude of owners and is highly fragmented. Many of these offices will pop up and only operate from January to April. Keep your eyes open this tax season, you'll see that income tax sign in the window of the strangest places. The reality is that our primary source to the competition is thousands of small businesses in which the owner is likely completing a large portion of the work themselves and operating in offices, just like the ones you're seeing now. \r\nSo how do the independents compete? Essentially, there are 4 competitive variables in the tax industry: building client relationships and scaling their businesses; developing a recognized brand that consumers will trust; as in almost all business models, price is a competitive variable, either through the structure of the pricing model or the actual price point and potentially both; and the last variable is quality, both real and perceived. So now let's take a deeper dive into each of these variables, as they pertain to our true competitors: The independents.\r\nMost independents develop their businesses through relationships. These are likely people filing their returns for the family and friends on the kitchen table. Once they tap out of those relationships and referrals, they're challenged to attract new clients. Thus, as illustrated in the graph, nearly half of the independents are completing less than 100 returns annually. These owners find out that it is very difficult to scale because they needed to establish infrastructure, such as marketing, technology and even furniture. This is why you see only 5% of the market completing greater than 1,000 returns. \r\nDeveloping a brand takes time and a significant amount of investment. Obviously, these mom and pops have a presence in their local community, but they do not have the marketing dollars or the resources to differentiate themselves and compete on brand recognition. Often, independents don't convey the fact that they do taxes, instead, pointing to their primary businesses, as you can see in these pictures, of typical independent offices. For most tax filers, this is their biggest financial transaction of the year, and who they have complete their taxes matters. A brand matters because it carries with it reputation and trust. The reality is, independents have names, not trusted brands. \r\nPricing is another lever that is often used in the industry. The question is, whether it's actually a differentiator in the assisted category. Before I give our point of view on that question, it's important to understand the 3 most common pricing models in the industry. First is charge by the hour, which is used commonly within the CPA category, where the clients are more complex and tax preparation is only one of the many services provided. \r\nThe second is fixed pricing, which is sometimes used as a bait-and-switch strategy, with additional junk fees added to the return. Junk fees are charges included on a client's bill that are hard to justify, such as processing fees and technology fees. \r\nAnd finally, there's the variable model that is based on the complexity of the return. H&R Block uses this structure, which generally acts as a standard for the industry, including independents. \r\nHowever, as you can see, prices vary widely in the independent category, exemplifying the low-price elasticity within the market. Owners can and do charge whatever they want. Those at the high end of the range may be including hidden and/or junk fees. And those at the low end of the range, represent those preparing taxes at the kitchen table and family and friend pricing. With such a varied approach to pricing, it's clear that independents do not use price for differentiation. They just use it as the primary means of making money. \r\nAnd to reinforce that point, H&R Block is actually below the median of the market. So with the relationship, brand and price not being differentiators, that leaves us with quality. In fact, the biggest differentiation in independent category is quality. And quality varies in the industry as greatly as price. Due to the small size of the independents, most need other sources of revenue to ensure they can pay their operating expenses for the full year. Therefore, it's not surprising that 70% of the independents expand beyond tax preparation and provide other products and services. \r\nHowever, these services vary widely, and some are not even adjacent to the tax preparation. We've seen everything from bookkeeping, to notary, to insurance, to wedding services. You name it. Many owners are just trying to keep cash flow high enough in the off-season to survive, which makes perfect sense. Or doing taxes is just a way to supplement their primary income. In either case, the multiple service offerings actually creates a lack of focus on tax preparation, translating to less training, less expertise and a lower quality of return. \r\nIn most industries such as food, transportation and healthcare, quality is a legitimate high-end variable. However, as I mentioned earlier, for some tax paper, the term quality may not refer to the level of service, but instead, the level of refund. Unfortunately, it is often low quality that attracts these filers. And what I mean by low quality is that the size of the tax refund certain owners provide is greater because they are not completing returns accurately. \r\nHow do we know this? Through our prospecting of independents, we have completed due diligence on hundreds of independent business owners. Our review consists of comparing our local H&R Block office returns to that of the independent, including EIC and other tax credits. We also go on site and review the documentation of the key refund generating tax credits and look to identify any unusual patterns. \r\nFor example, we reviewed several businesses earlier this year that had the exact same business expense deduction at the same exact dollar amount for every client. \r\nFinally, we talked to the business owners, and it's surprising what they're willing to share with us. It becomes evident fairly quickly whether we are working with someone who has a quality mindset. In fact, we are finding that nearly 1 in every 2 prospects we review have some form of noncompliance. And 1 in 4 are knowingly committing fraud. What this tells us is that many independents are differentiating their business by providing inflated refunds through fraudulent activity. \r\nI do this for a living, and the level of fraud in the industry continues to be shocking to me. Sadly, it's only getting worse. Let me share one more example. How many of you know who the fourth largest provider in 2013 in the assisted tax preparation category? It was Instant Tax Service, and it was not a small player. They had 150 locations and filed over 100,000 returns. However, Instant Tax was shut down due to egregious acts of fraud. Not just 1 or 2 franchisees, the entire network was shutdown. Often, you will hear of fines or suspensions or both, but completely shutting down a business is almost unheard of. \r\nI want to share a couple of quotes. First, from the court ruling where the court stated that Instant Tax prepared false tax documents, filed false documents with the IRS and encouraged others to do so. And the Assistant Attorney General of the Justice Department's Tax Division stated that Instant Tax \"grew large through abhorrent means.\" This included things such as filing returns without customer authorization and forging customer signatures. \r\nAnd what is terribly unfortunate is after this happened, the franchisees didn't stop doing what they're doing. In fact, we've seen prior franchisees from this brand replace their signs, switch their names, only to continue their past ways. \r\nHowever, though fraud and low quality is pervasive in this industry, there are honest, good businesses out there. We have had some initial success already and believe that through acquiring good independents or having independents join H&R Block as franchisees, we can achieve an attractive rate of return. Also, consolidating the independent space allows us the ability to expand and enter into new client segments, stretching our brand to areas in which we may not have been as relevant, such as ethnic and/or expertise markets. \r\nLastly, there's an arbitrage opportunity for us to take advantage of as well. We're able to acquire independents at a 3 to 4x EBITDA while we're trading close to 10x EBITDA. \r\nNow I mentioned the fragmented nature of the independent market earlier. Our focus is squarely centered on the independents that are completing greater than 100 returns, which provides us a candidate pool of 67,000 independents, locations and 34 million returns, representing $5 billion in revenue. We feel like this is a great opportunity for H&R Block, especially since we also know that the independent population is aging. \r\nIn fact, with 63% of the independents, 55 years of age or older, it's likely these owners will soon be seeking succession plans. However, these are not the easiest businesses to sell. Prospective buyers are challenged to find financing due to little-to-no fixed assets attached to the business. Additionally, these are relationship businesses, and owners want to take care of their clients and staff. \r\nAnd finally, almost any sale will require 1 or 2-year trailing contingency repayment. Therefore, owners need to be thoughtful on who is purchasing their book of business. \r\nFor these reasons, opportunity exists in the space for H&R Block as we are a reputable, capable buyer. Another advantage for us is the synergies we bring to the table that others don't have. First, we're able to offer high-quality financial products, on which we earn strong margins. Many independents don't even offer these products today. And if they do, they make little to no margin. \r\nSecond, our field management is the best in the industry. We have decades of experience in operating a company and franchise network. \r\nNext, with our footprint, we're able to provide a flexible, creative solutions by consolidating locations, selling offices and other hybrids. \r\nAnd finally, we have an operational infrastructure that is second to none; exceptional training, technology, software and CRM capabilities that can be leveraged for any acquisition or conversion.\r\nAnd the independent space is not the only opportunity in which we are focused. There's another opportunity right in our own backyard. Currently, our own network in the U.S. is comprised of over 10,000 offices, of which 60% are company operated and 40% are franchised. Generally, the company owned and operated are in the urban and suburban markets, while we prefer to franchise the rural areas of the country. And while we're not looking to materially change that balance, we're working to reacquire 650 plus core urban offices we sold to franchisees, essentially reversing a short-term refranchising strategy that was executed prior to 2012. \r\nThis year, we bought back a significant number of these offices. Unlike other capital-intensive businesses, this will be a long-term win for our company, as we are able to generate favorable earnings and positive cash flow to H&R Block's financials from offices that are company-owned versus operated as franchisees. \r\nSo in closing, independents constitute 48% of the revenue in the assisted category and are true competitors in the assisted market. Fraud within the category is astoundingly widespread, and many of our independent categories are leveraging it as their key value proposition. \r\nAnd lastly, the independent space is highly fragmented, and our ability to successfully bring the best of the independents into the H&R Block brand presents an opportunity for us. Thank you for your time today.\r\n[Video Presentation]\n\n---\n\nAs I mentioned in our opening comments, I'm going to talk to you now about how we are investing in our Retail business and what's next for our Tax Plus strategy. The investments we're making underscore our deep commitment to remaining the leading player in the tax preparation industry. We are the industry leader primarily for 4 reasons. \r\nNumber one, our brand awareness. At 98%, we are well ahead of any competitor. \r\nNumber two, our scale. We have the fifth largest retail footprint in the country. At over 10,000 offices in the U.S., no one in this industry comes close to our reach. \r\nNumber three, the quality for which we are best known, our tax expertise. We have the best, most highly trained people in the business. \r\nAnd number four, what keeps us highly relevant, our innovation. And these factors all combine to give us a huge competitive advantage. But we know we have to continuously improve to maintain the very high relevance of this brand, to invest in key areas to make sure we continue to meet our client's expectations. \r\nAnd we're doing this in 4 areas: our technology, our people, our offices and our Tax Plus products. Let's start with technology. You may not realize this but H&R Block is as much a technology company as we are a retailer. We have to be. Our clients are digitally savvy and use digital channels. Further, we understand that an effective distributed network must be reliable, safe and secure, which goes toward our larger efforts of continually -- continuously enhancing the user experience. The first technology area I'll highlight is MyBlock, a great example of how we're enabling client interface, not just during the tax season, but every day of the year. \r\nYou should think of MyBlock as the client's virtual filing cabinet. MyBlock enables the client to upload and share documents year-round with his or her tax pro, to check Emerald Card transactions and balances, to schedule an appointment. And MyBlock also allows us to content market to clients with product offerings, news and other information that's personal and relevant to them. In essence, it's the glue that binds us to our clients all year long. \r\nToday, fully 5 million of our clients are using MyBlock from both retail and digital, and that number is growing. So our competitors often talk about big data but we're focused on a whole lot of little data, client data. And MyBlock is a remarkable capability that provides convenience, information and security. It's another example of serving our clients anywhere, any way and any time they want and from all platforms. \r\nAnd this isn't just a nice thing to do for our clients. MyBlock is having a real impact. Here are a couple of facts. We've seen a 350% increase from 2013 to 2014 in the number of documents that our clients are uploading. And during the peak filing period this year, some 200,000 of our clients were logging into MyBlock daily. \r\nNow we've also made great progress with office technology integration. We've invested strategically in our multi-channel approach for locating offices, finding tax pros and setting appointments and obtaining client feedback. And our clients are empowered, too. As an example, in retail appointment setting, clients are now scheduling over 25% of these appointments through hrblock.com in the .com app. Another example is our recently redesigned Tax Pro Finder. Clients are now empowered through a simplified experience. And this new responsive design enables clients to easily navigate to find photos and information on thousands of tax pros. And they can access local tax office pages too. So whether it's in an office, by mobile, through the web or phoning our call centers, our office integrations are matching expertise to client needs across all platforms, laptops, tablets, mobile. \r\nNow another significant improvement this year, we're also moving to a new private, cloud-based core tax platform that we call Blockworks. This is a huge step forward in the technology our tax pros use to prepare and submit returns. In our 60-year history, we've gone from doing returns with pen and paper to a single automated system, and now to a common tax engine as part of our multi-year simplification strategy. Simply put, investing in our tax preparation program enables us to innovate faster and further enhance the client experience. \r\nTo be clear, we're not changing everything this year. We are phasing in Blockworks over time to ensure a seamless transition. This includes ensuring redundancy and protection of our compressed revenue model and executing a rigorous training and certification program for our tax pros. \r\nNow my discussion of technology investments wouldn't be complete without talking about enterprise data security. Data breaches seem to be in the news just about every day now. It's on everybody's mind, and we are taking specific actions, such as continuously monitoring for threats and proactively defending against them. I'm not going to go into details here, but I can assure you that we've taken very important measures, such as hardening our network and training our people to mitigate threats.\r\nNow in addition to these investments in technology, we're also investing in our people. Enhancing the client experience all starts with our people, so we set aggressive client satisfaction targets. And over the past year, we increased our Net Promoter Score more than 3 points. We are now at almost 75%, which is a great rating. But we aren't satisfied. Our ultimate goal is a Net Promoter Score of 80%, a truly world-class level of service, and one that will place us among the top retail brands. To that end, we're also investing in our bench strength, hiring more first-year tax pros and more Spanish-speaking tax pros. We've also conducted extensive training for this coming tax season on Blockworks, on the tax implications of the Affordable Care Act and other complexities of the tax code. That's 2.5 million hours of training, which is triple what we did last year. \r\nAnother key part of enhancing the client experience is the physical environment of our offices. You heard us talk in detail last year about our multi-year plan to improve the look and feel of our offices, and I'm happy to report that we've made significant progress since then. Today, over 87% of our company offices have undergone a makeover, all with new signage, giving us the best-looking, most professional offices in the industry. And we anticipate completing the remaining 13% of company offices and all franchise offices within a few years. \r\nFinally, we're investing in our array of Tax Plus products before, during and after the tax event, which we believe present a unique value proposition to our clients. As I said in my opening remarks this morning, we were pleased with our performance this past tax season. In particular, we saw an 11% increase in revenue from our Tax Plus products to $432 million. We delivered with a singular focus on the client experience. \r\nThe Emerald Advance line of credit is an unsecured line of credit of up to $1,000. This product is unique. No one else in the industry has anything like it. It's offered to clients from November through January. We rolled it out November 24th, and we're getting a great response. Though the Emerald Advance has not been a direct source of revenue growth over the past few years, it does offer our clients value, as it meets their specific credit needs when they need it most. \r\nIn turn, over 92% of Emerald Advance clients return to have their taxes done. And because we have a relationship with our clients and have access to their information, we know who may benefit the most from the Emerald Advance. \r\nNow with the refund transfer, our clients have an easy and convenient way to pay for their tax-preparation fees with no out-of-pocket expenses. And enable -- and it enables clients without a bank account to receive a direct deposit of their refund. We sold 5.5 million units in fiscal 2014. So this has proven to be a very important product for a significant portion of our clients. \r\nRevenues from the refund transfer increased 15% to $181 million, and the take rate increased 180 basis points. \r\nNow the crown jewel of our Tax Plus products is the Emerald Prepaid MasterCard, which continued its strong performance in 2014. This best-in-class product continues to win awards for its combination of low fee structure, exceptional features and convenience. A leading consumer advocacy organization just named it the #2 best prepaid card in the industry for the second straight year. And it won Best in category Top of Wallet at the 2014 Paybefore Awards. This past tax season, we issued 2.4 million Emerald Cards, with a total of $9.2 billion in deposits. Revenue was up 5% to $104 million. And cardholder engagement continues to improve, as evidenced by increased reload activity. Total unique reloaders were up 14% in fiscal year 2014, which is a critical metric for our year-round usage strategy. This translates to the top line with 2014 revenue per card growing 13% over the previous year. \r\nOur Emerald Card strategy remains straightforward. More cards with more usage. And we're doing several things to increase its appeal like expanding our reload network and getting lower reload fees for our clients. And our clients can now also get joint cards, in which they can add 1 person to the primary card account holder's account: family, relative, friend, as long as they are of legal age. \r\nAnd I'm very excited to introduce, new for this tax season, a sleeker, more contemporary Emerald Card. It's no longer prominently branded H&R Block. And it's more contemporary look, better captures its status as one of the best prepaid cards in the industry. So I'm very pleased to unveil it for you today, the new Emerald Prepaid MasterCard for 2015. I would like to thank our design consultant, Brian Kaufmann, from Viking Global Investors for his inspiration on the new design. \r\nNow our fourth Tax Plus product, Peace of Mind, is a well-established warranty-like product that helps clients who are concerned about the potential of an IRS audit. Anybody who's ever received a letter from the IRS knows that feeling. Now POM guarantees our U.S. clients that we will represent them if they are audited, and it also guarantees that Block will pay up to $5,500 of additional taxes owed, if it was our error. And this isn't just for sophisticated filers. 1040EZ clients accounted for the largest percentage increase in POM take rates last year. \r\nOverall, take rates on POM increased 4 points to 24% as we improved the offer flow during the tax interview and engagement by our tax pros. \r\nNow before I conclude, I'm pleased to announce that we've added a new Tax Plus product to the mix this year. And with what we're seeing in the tax-preparation industry right now, this product could not have been more timely or relevant. It hasn't hit the street just yet, but I wanted to give you a preview of it here today. As you know, identity theft is a huge and growing problem. Javelin Research, which tracks the industry, reported 13 million identity theft victims in 2013, a 30% increase just since 2010. And of course, we have all heard about the major retailer data breaches. And that leads us to the growing problem of tax identity theft, where criminals use personal identity information to file a fraudulent tax return and steal taxpayer refunds. Over 3 million taxpayers have been impacted since 2010, 3 million. How has this become such a pervasive problem? It's because the IRS system is built around the Social Security number. And in most cases, the IRS doesn't have a way to expeditiously compare and verify taxpayer identity with W-2 information. The established system is clearly vulnerable. Just watch this clip from a 60 Minutes episode that aired in September.\r\n[Presentation]\n\n---\n\nSo that 60 Minutes segment covered a lot of ground. So what you saw was a highly condensed clip of the original segment. But it captures the essence of the tax identity theft problem. So what exactly can consumers do now to prevent tax identity theft? Truthfully, not much. They can file their taxes as early as possible in hopes of beating the bad guys to the punch. But that doesn't work if they're waiting on key tax documents. They can work hard to protect their personal information, but that's often beyond their control. They can pay for general identity theft monitoring and alerts, which may be a good idea. But the truth is none of these currently protect consumers against tax identity theft, which is where H&R Block comes in. \r\nWe're doing something about this growing problem and that's why we're introducing our newest Tax Plus product, Tax Identity Shield. We worked hard over the last year to develop this innovative, affordable and effective solution to tax identity theft. Tax Identity Shield is exclusive to H&R Block, and we think our clients will welcome this solution to a growing problem. Here's what our product does. One, a pretax season scan to provide awareness of tax identity theft risk. Two, custom advice on how to reduce the risk. Three, a proactive defense to help protect future tax returns. Four, early detection of any fraudulent returns submitted via H&R Block with the tax e-file notification. And five, expert guidance and support with our restoration services in the event of tax identity theft. Another interesting point in this product is that we've partnered with Equifax to enable key capabilities such as the preseason tax identity theft risk assessment. We're very excited about Tax Identity Shield and really about being able to fill a need in the market. We'll be launching Tax Identity Shield in January nationwide. \r\nSo to wrap up, you can see that we continue to make significant investments in our technology, our people, our offices and in our Tax Plus products. And this is all geared toward maintaining our high relevance in a competitive market, to making sure we are well positioned for the future and that H&R Block remains the market leader. \r\n \r\nWe are now going to take a 15-minute break. Please return to your seats by 10:20. Thank you.\r\n[Break]\n\n---\n\nEverybody, if you could take your seats, we will get started in just about a minute. So if you can take your seats. Thank you.\r\n[Audio Gap]\r\n[Video Presentation]\n\n---\n\nGood morning. I'm Mark Ciaramitaro, and I lead our new business and new product initiatives, including our enterprise focus on the Affordable Care Act. \r\nSince the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010, the nexus of the law has been to enable health insurance enrollment for uninsured households. \r\nGoing forward however, you will soon see that the tax consequences will play an equally important role. In fact, the reality is that the Affordable Care Act has ushered in the biggest change to the federal tax code in decades. \r\nWith the upcoming tax season, millions of households will experience a new intersection between 2 highly complicated consumer arenas, healthcare and taxes. This intersection will take the form of new coverage requirements, tax credit reconciliations, potential tax penalties, and associated exemptions, new tax forms in just an overall increase in tax complexity.\r\nLast year, when we discussed ACA, we outlined the law's overall objective to increase coverage quality, affordability, and access using a number of tax-base carrot and stick mechanisms, including both the individual mandate and premium tax credits. \r\nWe also provided the preliminary view that a significant number of H&R Block tax clients could be directly impacted by ACA. At that time, there was and unfortunately still is, pervasive consumer confusion regarding the tax implications of this law. We also introduced our intentions to provide marketplace consumer enrollment assistance via our partnership with GoHealth.\r\nBecause the impact of the Affordable Care Act on the tax code is so pervasive, we believe that the combination of ACA with taxes will create new growth opportunities for H&R Block. \r\nWe also believe that we are well-positioned to capitalize, both in the tax category and with new related services. However, we are in the early stages with potential changes on the law -- to the law on the horizon. Therefore, it'll take time for this opportunity to fully unfold.\r\nOne of the biggest potential changes concerns the ongoing set of legal challenges to ACA. As many of  you know, there has been a history of litigation around ACA, both at the District Court and Supreme Court levels. \r\nWith regard to the upcoming Supreme Court case, King vs. Burwell, a decision for the plaintiff is coming somewhat could substantially disrupt the ability for millions of household to receive premium tax credits, in addition to undermining other key ACA provisions. \r\nThere is an enormous amount of talk and chatter on this topic, but frankly, no one knows what the outcome will be. What we do know for sure, is that regardless of the decision, there will be a significant tax impact into 2016.\r\nSo here is our game plan for today. We will start by reviewing the coverage results from 2014 with an eye towards understanding the magnitude of people that will be directly impacted by the tax consequences of ACA. \r\nWe will also share findings from a recent survey of our H&R Block tax clients regarding this new law. Then we will quite literally dive into a more detailed explanation of the major ACA tax impacts, and use a few consumer scenarios to illustrate the emotional dimension of these impacts. \r\nNext, we will lay out where we have made substantial investments in order to serve our tax clients and capitalize on this unique opportunity to demonstrate our tax expertise.\r\nWe will then provide a brief update regarding our enrollment services partnership with GoHealth, and we will close with our thesis regarding what we believe to be the headline opportunities that you as shareholders should care about.\r\nLet's start with 2014 coverage status. The technology issues associated with last year's launch of healthcare.gov have been well documented. While enrollments were initially slowed, by mid-April, over 8 million consumers had submitted applications nationwide. \r\nThe latest Health and Human Services reports indicate that as of November, 6.7 enrollees were paid up with their major medical plans, with about 85% receiving government assistance through advance premium tax credits. \r\nIt's important to keep in mind, however, that the total number of enrollees does not equate to the total number of tax returns because multiple family members could be included in a single application. \r\nBack in April, the congressional budget office projected 2015 enrollments would climb to 13 million and eventually to 24 million. But more recently, Secretary Burwell's staff provided their forecast of 9 million to 10 million paid enrollees for 2015. \r\nHHS now believes, it will take 4 to 5 years for the 24 million enrollment target to be achieved. The real take-home message to you, however, is that as marketplace enrollment numbers climb, so too will the specific tax impacts faced by tax filing households, which is one of the reasons, we believe, it will take time for the full effects of the Affordable Care Act to become evident. \r\nBeyond marketplace enrollment, there are other important ACA provisions that are influencing household coverage levels, namely the impact of expanded Medicaid in about 27 states. In fact, a recent study indicated that, in addition to the approximately 7 million who gain coverage via the marketplace enrollment process, another 3 million to 4 million gained coverage via Medicaid, for a total of approximately 10 million.\r\nRecent Gallup poll results reflected this impact with the reported drop in the overall uninsured rate from 18% to 13.4%. At the same time, the CBO and the joint committee on taxation issued a report that indicated, even with the growing marketplace and Medicaid enrollment, about 30 million people in America will likely continue to be uninsured. Thankfully for them, the majority should be eligible for exemptions, which would leave about 4 million people potentially paying penalties.\r\nWhile these studies provide a useful context around the magnitude of the ACA impacts, we wanted to gain a deeper insight into how our current H&R Block tax clients were affected. So we fielded a research study in August among a large sample of both our retail and digital tax clients. \r\nWe also weighted our results by age, income tax forms, and filing method to ensure a representative sample. The results from our study indicated that approximately 25% of our current clients, including both assisted and DIY, will directly confront ACA tax impacts either due to the need to reconcile premium tax credits, calculate penalties, or qualify for exemptions.\r\nMost were impacted by potential penalties or are likely to be eligible for exemptions. But this survey provided another important insight. Most experts who study ACA tend to see households in black-and-white terms that is either fully covered or uninsured. But our survey revealed a much messier reality, that almost half of affected households have much more complicated and frankly uneven coverage situations. In fact, we found that only half of households, were covered under the same health plan with many experiencing coverage changes throughout the year. I'll discuss this implication later, but in simple terms, it means many households will face multiple simultaneous tax impacts associated with the Affordable Care Act.\r\nFinally, our survey again exposed massive consumer confusion despite the law being in effect now for almost a year. You might ask, what's all the confusion about? Well, many are simply overwhelmed and mystified by all the information and frankly misinformation in the media. And those who are enrolled through the marketplace and received tax credits didn't even understand they received government assistance. \r\nAs a general rule, virtually, everyone is confused about the reconciliation process. For those without minimum essential coverage, many still don't understand how penalties are calculated, let alone the exemptions process or tax forms filing requirements.\r\nProbably the most important takeaway, we heard, was that now more than ever, our tax clients are counting on us to help them understand, first, if they are impacted by ACA; and second, if so, what that means to their personal tax situation, both now and in the future.\r\nWith that background, let's move on to providing a more detailed understanding of the major ACA tax impacts for the coming filing season. My intent here is to give you a deeper appreciation for what a typical impacted household might face come tax time. There are some in our industry, who would simply claim the Affordable Care Act is no big deal. While that may be the case for 75% of our client-base who have employer or government health coverage. For the remaining 25%, well, you can judge for yourself. Strap on your seatbelts, because as Han Solo famously said in Star Wars, \"we are going in; we are going in deep.\"\r\nLast year, we told you what we thought the tax impact would be; based upon our reading of the law, but we now have an even deeper understanding based on the first wave of formal IRS tax forms and instructions released in September. \r\nI say, first wave because we continue to work with the IRS around a number of areas where we still have important questions. Based on these instructions, we can now confidently take a deep review into this specific tax implications of ACA. We have provided each of you with a handout containing these forms and instructions just in case you have trouble sleeping at night.\r\nIn basic terms, there are 6 tax impacts related to the Affordable Care Act for filing households. First, there will be new tax documents that provide critical information regarding health plan coverage, and in some cases, premium tax credit payments. Next, all taxpayers will experience new questions regarding the status of each household member's insurance coverage for each month of 2014. As we discussed last year, there will be a defined process for reconciling the premium tax credits, households received when they enrolled via the marketplace portal based upon their actual household income. Those who are uninsured, for all the part of 2014, will face a new set of worksheets designed to calculate their shared responsibility payment or what we call the ACA tax penalty.\r\nAlong with the penalty comes a complicated maze of exemptions that many will likely qualify for, provided they filed the proper forms. And finally, ACA impacted consumers will have to deal with new tax form filing requirements, among the most notable being, restrictions around the use of the 1040EZ based tax form. \r\nLet's start with the new tax docs. First, we have the 1095-A, which for those that enrolled in either the Federal or state marketplaces is a critical document that indicates each household members coverage status and premium tax credit payments. \r\nThe 1095-A is actually a part of a new series of notices commonly referred to as the 1095 series. These notices come in the form of either an A, B, or C. A notices will be issued by the federal and state health insurance marketplaces, and you will see in a few minutes, that they are a must have filing documents. \r\nThe 1095-Bs and Cs will be issued by health insurance carriers, the military, the government, and employers. These notices are voluntary in 2015, but will become mandatory next year in 2016.\r\nAs with other similar notices, such as the 1098 or 1099, this information is not just provided to the household, it's also provided to the IRS for cross referencing. \r\nFor this year, consumers should receive their 1095-A notices from the marketplaces by late January, and we have been told electronic versions will also be available. \r\nThe 1095-A contains key information needed for the premium tax credit reconciliation process, such as covered family members, monthly tax credit amounts, and especially the premiums for the benchmark second lowest cost Silver Plan in the filers rating area.\r\nLet's now talk about how tax filers will verify their insurance coverage. As I mentioned, for the first time this coming tax season, each and every filer will be asked about their insurance coverage status. The good news is that household's fully covered through an employer, qualified private insurance or government plans will simply need to attest to this coverage. What this means is they will not have to provide evidence of insurance coverage, such as an insurance policy, and most will be able to simply check the box.\r\nAdditionally, tax professionals will not be accountable for any special IRS due diligence requirements associated with verifying coverage for family members. \r\nHowever, understanding the type of coverage, and who in the household was covered will be critical. Because if even 1 household member was not covered for any period of time, this check-box cannot be used.\r\nNext tax season, this all changes as all filers will need to provide coverage documentation. At this point, some of you may be thinking, okay, but what's going to prevent someone from lying about their coverage status? Well, the short answer is, probably nothing at the time of filing. However, the IRS has indicated to us that they have every intention of enforcing ACA tax provisions and they certainly have legal recourse to go back and take a deeper look in the case of suspected fraud for up to 10 years. \r\nThe more practical answer you will see in a few minutes, is why bother with lying when the vast majority of uninsured filers will be able to qualify for legitimate penalty exemptions. \r\nBefore talking about these exemptions, we will first turn to the reconciliation process.\r\nWhen 8 million-plus consumers enrolled via federal or state marketplaces, most qualified for advance payments of their premium tax credit. Come tax season, it's true-up time. \r\nIn order to fully understand reconciliation, however, we have to take a step back and talk about the premium tax credit, which is essentially government financial assistance intended to reduce the cost of insurance premiums for qualified households. \r\nTo qualify for a premium tax credit, the household must not currently have or have access to affordable qualified health insurance. By the way, qualified means the governments 10 -- it meets the governments 10 minimum essential coverage requirements. The good news is, most employer, government and private plans currently meet these requirements.\r\nSecondly, the household's income must be between a 100% to 400% of the federal property level. The actual credit they receive, ladders up or down based on income, family size, and zip code, because it's indexed to the second lowest cost silver plan premium in the applicant's rating area.\r\nNow historically, tax credits are typically claimed retroactively at the time of filing. However, in the case of ACA's premium tax credit, it's prospective, because the credit is estimated upfront and then actually advanced directly to the insurance company for each month the applicant is enrolled.\r\nFinally, anyone who receives premium tax credits must, by law, file a tax return. If they don't, they may lose the option going forward to qualify according to HHS. Now here are the typical Federal property level income bands that households must fall into to qualify for premium tax credits. \r\nIt surprises many when they see how high these income bands go. For instance, up to 94,000 for a family of 4. Also, household income for purposes of the premium tax credit is actually modified adjusted gross income, which is essentially your AGI plus tax exempt Social Security, tax exempt interest, and unearned foreign income. \r\nIt also includes a taxable income from all family members, not just the primary tax filer. In case you're interested, here's the actual formula used to determine a household's advance premium tax credit amount. Essentially, it multiplies the forecast of the enrollee's household income, times an applicable percentage ranging from 2% to 9.5%, and then subtracts that total from the premium of the second lowest cost silver plan in the households trading area, matched to the applicant's age, family, and composition. Got that? Don't worry, we do.\r\nWe are now ready to go a little deeper into the actual reconciliation process. \r\nStarting this year, tax filers must adjust the premium tax credit based upon their actual 2014 household income using a new form called the 8962. This process essentially follows 4 steps. Step 1 involves the determination of the premium tax credit the household was entitled to, based on their actual modified adjusted gross income on their tax return. Step 2, compares this determination to the advance payments actually received by the household, which if you recall, comes from their 1095-A. That's why it's a must-have document. Step 3, then adjusts the tax refund or taxes due based on the difference either with the repayment of the premium tax credit or an additional credit amount. Finally, for those facing a repayment, the law also created a tax liability limitation table. The table works like this. For those between a 100% to 400% of the FPL, there is a cap for any premium tax credit liability owed based on the household's filing status and income. \r\nHowever, household's whose income exceeds 400% of FPL will need to pay back the entire premium tax credit they received, which in some cases can amount to thousands of dollars. My guess is that you will hear lots of stories about these situations once tax season begins.\r\nThis reconciliation process has even deeper levels of complexity. For instance, there is a specific interview and allocation method for spreading the premium tax credit across separate tax filing households, such as for divorced couples. And there is an alternative process for handling, those who got married during the year. And for filers, whose household members changed or got employer coverage, but didn't notify the marketplace, well the 1095-A issued to them is actually not correct and a special approach will be required. But the law is ambiguous on this point. Any household that received advance premium tax credits must file a tax return with the 8962, and if they are married, they must file a joint return, and if they don't, their tax return will be held by the IRS delaying access to their tax refund.\r\nRemember, as I said earlier, when I talked about the 1095-A, the IRS knows who received tax credits, and is therefore expecting the 8962 with their return.\r\nIf they don't file a tax return they may be disallowed eligibility for future premium tax credits. And then finally, as I said, households near to 400% FPL level need to pay close attention to avoid paying back their entire premium tax credit. \r\nLet's turn now to tax penalties. As you know, the Affordable Care Act created a new mandate, which will institutionalize a new system of tax penalties for households without qualified health insurance coverage, which is applied on a per month basis. \r\nOur consumer research validated that while most households are aware of the penalty, unfortunately, their awareness was focused on the individual flat fee amount of $95 versus the percentage of income method. \r\nThe percentage method most often ends up with a higher penalty amount, and for that reason is probably the one, people should be paying attention to. \"Why?\" You may ask. Well, let's take a look at an example. Under the flat fee calculation, a 3 person household uninsured for all of 2014 with a taxable income of $50,000 would have a flat fee penalty of $285. However, under the percentage method, their calculated penalties are actually closer to $500. The IRS then takes the higher outcome of the 2 methods, and the $500 value gets carried from the worksheets into the tax return, assuming that household does not qualify for an exemption. \r\nIn sum, there are few key things to remember, we got in tax penalties. You'll sometimes hear the term, as I said, shared responsibility payment, when referring to the ACA tax penalties. That's its official name. Next year, those penalties will double to 2% of household taxable income or a flat fee of $325 per adult. \r\nBy the way, the maximum penalty is capped to the cost of a national average premium for an applicable bronze level plan, which is currently around $2,500 for an individual.\r\nThere's been a quite a bit of urban mythology around whether the IRS will even collect the tax penalty. But from what we know, the IRS has indicated it has every intention to fulfill its collection duties, even with some legal limitations. And if a household happens to incorrectly calculate their penalty, they will receive an IRS collection notice.\r\nNow let's pivot and talk about exemptions. There are varying estimates that 20 million to 25 million people will be theoretically subject to tax penalties in 2015 due to non-coverage. The not-so-secret reality is that most should qualify for an exemption to lower the cost of their ACA tax penalty or even eliminate it all together provided they complete and file using a new form 8965. However, from a tax filer perspective, the devil is in the details, as the challenge here is to find, calculate, and document which exemption they qualify for. Why? Well, because there is over 20 exemptions, and if you include the 14 hardship exemptions the number is well over 30, and each exemption type has different qualification requirements. There is 2 broad buckets of exemptions. Those that can be claimed on the tax return, and those that require a separate marketplace waiver application before the exemption can be claimed. The first bucket relates to the exemptions that can be claimed directly on the tax return and covers a wide range of circumstances, including unaffordability, short-term coverage gaps, government programs, residency status, and special group membership. By the way, those below the filing threshold are actually not required to file to claim an exemption.\r\nWe don't have time this morning to go into depth on each, but you can quickly see how many circumstances are actually addressed. The affordability exemption is an example of one that while potentially applicable to many households, is actually pretty tricky, because it requires the filer to document that the monthly premiums of either the marketplace plan or employer health plan available to them in 2014 exceeded 8% of their taxable household income.\r\nThe second bucket of exemptions includes those granted by the marketplace, and these actually have to be applied for separately before they can be claimed. \r\nGenerally, households that are members in particularly religious sects or those who have experienced to one of the long list of financial family or personal hardships may potentially qualify for marketplace exemptions. Within the hardship umbrella, itself, there are 14 distinct definitions ranging from eviction, foreclosure or utility shutoff to family hardships, to government program eligibility issues, all the way to the infamous \"Other\" category.\r\nThis is all well and good for deserving households, but the marketplace exemption process has 2 major issues from a consumer standpoint. The first is, simply lack of awareness since many of the uninsured household who experienced hardships would not have even gone to healthcare.gov to learn about them and apply. The second issue is the antiquated paper application process. Yes, I said paper. A few key points to remember for marketplace exemptions, is that each impacted household member needs to complete a 4-page paper application, which we've included in your handouts. There are specific documentation requirements for each hardship category, for instance copies of eviction notices or medical expenses would need to be attached to that application. \r\nThe time period of the family member's the exemption applies to also depends on the type of hardship. \r\nLastly, hardship exceptions are not permanent, and need to be applied for -- reapplied for each year. Here's a simplified flow diagram, outlining the steps involved in applying for a marketplace exemption. After completing the 4-part application, it needs to be mailed to an HHS service center in Kentucky. \r\nAt the present time, the marketplace is claiming a 2-week processing time, but we expect once tax season begins, that the processing time will take much longer, even up to 60 days, depending upon whether that application was properly completed. \r\nProvided the application is approved, the applying household will then receive a letter containing a specific exemption certificate number or ECN. \r\nThis number then has to be properly inserted on to a form 8965 and filed with the IRS in order for the tax filer to claim the marketplace exemption. \r\nLet me just state the obvious. This whole process is going to be confusing and frustrating for many tax filers. \r\nOrdinarily, clients who come in to our offices without an ECN in hand, would be looking at what we call the file now and amend later approach. \r\nHowever, there is some good late-breaking news, that the IRS will permit filers without an ECN in hand to claim their full refund using a pending code on Form 8965. This would avoid the inconvenience and expense of needing to come back and amend the tax return in order to claim the penalty exemption.\r\nHowever, the paper application would still need to be mailed to HHS. Given the complexity of the entire process -- exemption process, and the fact that few tax filers are even where they may qualify, we believe that helping our clients find and properly claim penalty exemptions is one of our biggest value-added opportunities for this coming tax season. In many cases, the value created by finding an exemption can exceed the entire cost of the tax return.\r\nThe sixth and final impact concerns new ACA-driven form filing requirements. The most prevalent change is that the 1040 easy-based form cannot be used for those filers who need to reconcile their premium tax credits. These filers will instead need to bump-up to a more complicated 1040 or 1040A. The good news is that while the easy cannot be used in conjunction with the premium tax credit, it can be used in situations where the filer is just verifying coverage, paying a penalty or claiming an exemption. \r\nFinally, I want to leave you with one last thought around ACA tax impacts. While discussing these impacts, you might have gotten the impression that each impacted household would face one of these tax consequences. Ah! If it was only that simple. On the contrary, we expect many tax filers will experience multiple simultaneous ACA tax impacts. How can that be? Well, you might, for instance have a household then enrolled in a plan via marketplace in January and then dropped coverage in July, or you might have some uninsured family members that qualify for exemptions and some that do not. As a result there can be many combinations of ACA forms and worksheets that may be needed.\r\nUnderstandably, your heads may be spinning at this point. So let's take a deep breath and summarize these key headlines. \r\nFirst, virtually all of the 8 million-or-so who enrolled in the health plan via federal or state-based marketplace will receive a new 1095-A tax doc this year. Next, every tax filer will be asked about their household coverage status with those that are covered with either an employer or government plan needing only to attest using a check-box. Anyone who received premium tax credits, when they enrolled on the marketplace, must file and when they file, they need to reconcile the credit using form 8962. \r\nUninsured households will face either a tax penalty or if they qualify, they will need to file for an exemption using form 8965, and ultimately, we believe, many families will confront multiple ACA tax impacts.\r\nWhat we have talked a lot about forms, check-boxes calculations, and formulas, there is another important dimension around these ACA tax impacts. \r\nI'm speaking to the confusion, frustration, and a range of emotions that consumers will experience this coming tax season as they confront this new law. \r\nWe felt the best way to convey this would be to walk you through a few real-life scenarios through the eyes of our clients that will illustrate the typical range of ACA situations that are likely to occur either at the tax desk or in front of the computer. \r\nLet's start with Dan and Lucy Green. Dan works as a retail store Manager for a small employer that doesn't provide health insurance. Dan and Lucy filed using a 1040EZ in 2013. When they heard about the new marketplaces, they were excited to be able to get affordable insurance, especially because Lucy is pregnant with their first child. When they enrolled on the federal marketplace, Dan was the sole earner in the household, and he estimated their household income for 2014 to be $38,000, because that's his annual salary. On that basis, the Green's qualified for advance premium tax credits that reduced the cost of their monthly insurance premiums. Now, let's fast-forward to January 2015, when the Green's receive in the mail a 1095-A document from the marketplace that indicates they received advanced tax credit payments of about $2,700. When the Green's get their taxes prepared, they learn that because they received advance premium tax credits, they will now need to reconcile the credit based on their actual household income for 2014. And because they received a tax credit, they also learned that they can no longer use the 1040EZ form and must now use a more complex 1040. Because the Green's year end household income, however, ends up being higher due to Lucy getting a part-time job, their reconciliation results in actually a $1,200 repayment to the government, which will be now be taken out of their tax refund. This was a refund that they were planning to use to buy a much-needed used car for Lucy. Both Dan and Lucy are surprised and frustrated because they now have to put that purchase on hold.\r\nNow, let's talk about Clyde and Vicki Mason. Clyde's an independent contractor and is currently uninsured. However, his spouse Vicki is covered under her employer's plan. Together the Mason's household income is about $65,000. Even though Clyde heard about the individual mandate, he does not believe the government will enforce it; and if they do, it's only going to cost him $95. When the Mason's come in to get their taxes prepared, they learn that because Clyde was uninsured for 2014, and he does not qualify for any exemptions, he will have to pay a shared responsibility payment to the government. Clyde's surprised, he will have to pay, but even more surprised when he learns that the tax penalty will be almost $450. \r\nClyde had never heard about the percentage of income method of calculating the penalty. The Mason's also learned that next year, if Clyde continues to be uninsured, their tax penalty will double to $900. As a result, Clyde is rethinking his plans for future insurance coverage. \r\nHere's our last case study. Michael and Tina Alvarez have a household income of about $23,000. Michael and Tina have 2 children and live in Texas, which is a non-expansion Medicaid state. Tina's mother lives with them as well, but does not have valid immigration documentation. Both parents and Tina's mom are uninsured, but their 2 children received coverage assistance from the government's Children Health Insurance Program or CHIP. When the Alvarez's family comes in for their taxes, their tax pro indicates that because both of them and Tina's mother were uninsured for 2014. They could face a $285 tax penalty, which scares them because they frankly need every penny of their refund to pay needed household expenses. However, after some digging, their tax professional indicates that they will qualify to receive a penalty exemption right at the tax desk due to their low income level, and because Tina's mom is not subject to ACA tax penalties.\r\nAs we walk through these scenarios, hopefully you saw some common themes play out: Confusion and strong emotions, especially frustration, born of lack of awareness or misperceptions. Increased tax complexity with new tax form filing requirements, surprise refund impacts for those filers who count on the refund each year for critical household expenses and the reality that while calculating the tax penalty is painful, finding an exemption represents a true value-added hero opportunity for the tax professional. Hopefully, it's now evident that for millions of filers this coming tax season, it's going to be whole new ballgame. And it's a new ballgame for H&R Block too. And addressing these new ACA tax impacts has required us to make some key investments in our core operating and client support model. Let's cover these in a little bit more detail. \r\nThese ACA-related investments fall into 5 categories: Training and support, Blockworks and DIY tax software, our GoHealth partnership, operations and support, and finally marketing programs. With ACA, we are looking at the biggest change to the federal tax code in decades. Fully preparing our tax professionals to effectively navigate the new ACA tax provisions is of paramount importance. Plain and simple, we are committed to making sure our tax pros have access to the most comprehensive ACA training in the industry. \r\nIn fact, all told, our tax professionals will received over 600,000 hours of ACA-specific training prior to tax season, including tax theory, client experience, and extensive case study work designed to prepare our tax pros to confidently handle the full range of situations they are likely to face and then some.\r\nAdditionally, we created a multilayered network of support tools and resources to ensure our tax professionals are kept up-to-date on new developments and get quick answers to their questions, especially around deeply complex areas of this law.\r\nEarlier, Bill introduced you to Blockworks, our new private cloud-based tax office software. Blockworks will also play a critical role guiding our tax professionals through all possible the ACA client situations. With Blockworks, our tax professionals will have access to a state-of-the-art tool with built-in guardrails and navigation designed to identify the optimal path for each and every client. \r\nIn addition to our office tax software, we also have enhanced our do-it-yourself text products to address the full range of ACA forms including reconciliation, penalties and exemptions as well as including the best help in the industry for user questions that may emerge during the tax interview. \r\nWhile H&R Block has enormous expertise around taxes, we don't have a lot of experience or expertise around health insurance. That's why we partnered with GoHealth. GoHealth is a privately held health insurance services software and outsourcing company with extensive experience with developing and managing consumer-based insurance exchange platforms. They have deep relationships with 200-plus insurance carriers and have full -- fully integrated call center capabilities, including agents licensed to sell throughout the United States. From a business standpoint, we split commissions with GoHealth for any enrolled client. \r\nACA will also impact our day-to-day retail operations. Clients who are directly impacted by ACA will likely take more tax preparation time, as well as frequent reminders to bring in the proper documentation.\r\nFor clients setting appointments this year, we're going to be asking them a few new questions upfront to determine if they are impacted and if so, we will be automatically adjusting their appointment times. We also plan to closely monitor key performance metrics and operational issues tied to ACA such as average wait times and tax returns that are on hold, waiting for the client to bring in the needed documentation.\r\nFinally, given the overall consumer confusion and angst around the tax impacts of the Affordable Care Act, we intend to aggressively promote our brand and our powerful ACA value proposition to America. Our plans include employing a wide array of marketing elements and media at national scale, including advertising, direct mail, search, office signage, digital assets, local marketing and PR events. In other words, we are not holding anything back when it comes to ACA as we believe now, more than ever, consumers will be looking for tax expertise that they can trust. \r\nNow let's talk about enrollment support. Compared to last year, thankfully, healthcare.gov and the state base marketplaces have operated much more smoothly. Nevertheless, the enrollment process continues to be daunting for many eligible households, especially with respect to finding, comparing and enrolling in the right health plan, with the right doctors and hospitals, with the right deductible level and the right prescription drug formulary. That is why we are continuing to offer enrollment assistance via our partnership with GoHealth.\r\nOpen enrollment began November 15. But compared to last year, the sign-up window is about half as long, lasting only until February 15. Besides the shorter time period, there's another issue with the February 15 end date. As practically, there will be many later filers who won't find out they are facing large penalties until later in the tax season. And as it now stands, they won't be able to enroll in a health plan unless they meet special enrollment qualifications. That is why we have formally requested that HHS consider extending the open-enrollment period for those facing penalties through the end of the tax season.\r\nAnd just as we did last year, during open enrollment, we will continue to provide free remote assistance by phone or online from licensed insurance agents who will walk clients step-by-step through the government application, help them with health plan selection and comparisons, officially enroll them in a plan and in some cases, even collect the first month's premium payment. \r\nI'm going to conclude by talking about the opportunity thesis for H&R Block. I stated at the outset that we believe this new intersection between ACA and taxes will create growth opportunities for H&R Block across multiple areas and over time. One of the immediate and direct opportunities ties to added tax form complexity for ACA-impacted filers and even more explicitly \r\n[Audio Gap] \r\nfocused on creating added tangible value via our are retail experience and our tax expertise. Practically, this means addressing client questions and concerns, finding tax penalty exemptions, helping them enroll in health plans and providing each client with information around ACA -- how ACA could impact them now and in the future. \r\nBy virtue of increased tax complexity and the overall confusion for a large swath of tax filers, we think the opportunities presented by the Affordable Care Act are significant. Including the opportunity to drive new client growth, whether that be from other tax preparers or DIY consumers who may be facing a more complicated tax interview that impacts their tax refund. We also see the potential to drive loyalty and retention and referrals by helping each of our clients understand if and how the Affordable Care Act impacts them in plain English. Combined with the immediate benefits of identifying valuable exemptions.\r\nAnd finally, we believe our enrollment assistance services extends our brand into new relevant consumer pinpoints that can provide block with additional revenue growth opportunities. \r\nIn closing, while many of you are focused on the impact of ACA and the upcoming tax season, the truth is that large-scale impacts of this law will unfold over time, and key interim changes could substantially alter the outcome. Likely coming in June will be the Supreme Court ruling, but there are other impacts that we need to keep an eye on as well, including increases in marketplace enrollments both this fall and next year, which will drive reconciliation activity. New coverage documentation requirements for all tax filers, the doubling of the tax penalties due to noncoverage and impact of the employer mandate both on businesses and employees.\r\nWe believe that H&R Block is set up to win with ACA. Because of our unrivaled brand strength, we will be the go-to-trusted source for all things ACA, because of our deep tax expertise and our industry-leading knowledge, training and support, because of our large pool of tax professionals operating out of an expansive national network of over 10,000 offices, because of our unique ability to serve a wide range of consumers across multiple channels and methods. And finally, because of our commitment to invest where and when we need to in training, technology, client service and marketing to serve clients better than any in the industry.\r\nThanks for hanging in there with me today and for your time.\r\n[Video Presentation]\n\n---\n\nSo I've watched Mark do that presentation several times and I have to tell you, I learn something new every time and it continues to amaze me. The complexity that this country's going to be going through in the near term.\r\nThe other thing I should point out before I begin my presentation is, I think this is the first time that all of you come to our Investor Meeting, we're actually giving you tax forms to take with you. So you can thank us later for that. \r\nAnyway, I'm Greg Macfarlane. I'm really here to take my time with you to wrap up everything together from what you've heard today. We've gone through a lot of material with you, but we do have an organization and a theme to it that I'll share with you. Before I do that, though, I do want to talk about our second quarter results that we released last evening. A lot of you had the chance to read that. \r\nSo with that, I'll start here with revenue. So revenues for the first quarter were $135 million. They were up slightly from the prior year. We had higher tax prep fees during the off-season in United States and Australia. Where in Australia, we actually just completed our 44th tax season and delivered another strong year, so congratulations to our Australia team. We also continue to improve our off-season usage of the Emerald Card, building on a Tax Plus momentum that you heard Bill talk about extensively earlier today. \r\nNext, adjusted pretax loss from continuing operations was $202 million, which was an increase of $19 million compared to the prior year. This increase in revenue was offset by an increase in operating expenses. This was primarily due to higher depreciation, amortization from acquisitions and planned office and technology upgrades. \r\nAdditionally, compensation and benefits were higher driven by the investments in people, Bill spoke to earlier today. A common theme you've heard throughout today's presentation is that we're investing back into our business. To capitalize on the opportunities that we've discussed earlier, we're investing in our technology, our people, our offices and our -- into Tax Plus. For the same reasons you're all attracted to the stock, we think these are good investments, which will drive significant return on investment. I'll speak to more about that later. \r\nOn an EPS basis, our seasonal adjusted net loss from continuing operations was $0.45 per share or $0.03 higher than the prior year. While our losses are trending modestly higher year-to-date, in a business as seasonal as ours, it's difficult to read too much into the off-season results. As many of you know, tax season performance during the fourth quarter represents a substantial majority of revenues and earnings for the year. \r\nSo with that, let me turn to discontinued operations. This includes the results of Sand Canyon. Here, our second quarter net income of $1 million compared to a loss of $2 million in the prior year. Sand Canyon remains engaged in bulk discussions with the counter parties from which it had received a significant majority of asserted claims. Just last week, Sand Canyon entered into a settlement agreement to resolve certain of those claims. Due to the timing and accounting rules around this, you will see a disclosure in our second quarter 10-Q later this week, but the actual accounting itself will not be included until the third quarter 10-Q. Importantly, the payment amount under the settlement agreement was fully included in the liability recorded at October 31, 2014, of $194 million. This represents progress for Sand Canyon and though there is still work ahead and it may take some time, Sand Canyon continues to make important stride to wind down its efforts. \r\nWith that, I now want to turn and talk more broadly about H&R Block. When I talk about H&R Block, for me, there are really 3 things that come to mind: First was we represent great growth opportunity for investors; second, we do that in a value environment; and third, we are consider to be a low-risk environment. Throughout today's presentation, you've heard a number of examples of those, but in summary, this is how we think about the growth opportunities. It's nice to work in an industry where you show up and every year, there's 1% to 2% more returns. This gets combined with the fact that in our industry, we have real pricing power and we know how to use it. \r\nIn terms of the favorable macro conditions, the economy continues to get stronger, homeownership percentages continue to get better and this is a nice tailwind for this company. Health care reform, after that presentation by Mark, you are now more understanding of health care reform in the United States than 99% of the people. If you don't understand the opportunities that present itself, then we need to do the presentation over for you. \r\nFourth is our Tax Plus. This has been a major part of our focus in the last several years, and we've seen good progress here. Importantly, building our successes upon last year, we move up from 20% to 24% attach rate. The continued progress in Emerald Card, we're introducing a new product to the market this year, the Taxes Identity Shield, which we're very excited about. \r\nJason Houseworth, early today, talked about our digital strategy in great amount of detail. Block is well positioned here. We invest real capital into this business. In fact, we overinvest in this area because we believe as this continued -- this industry continues to evolve that Block will naturally benefit.\r\nAnd lastly, as international growth. It represents a little bit less than 10% of our overall revenues but actually, it's growing at a greater rate from the rest of the company, and we expect that trend to continue. \r\nOn the value side, this company is a very profitable one. We generate a lot of cash here. So the #1 metric that we worry about is our ability to generate cash from this system. Importantly and increasingly, we're going to be talking about that as an efficient user of capital. Return on invested capital, ROE, is an important metric for us, and we generate a high level of return on the cash that we have. \r\nNext is our dividend track record and repurchased track record. We pay a healthy dividend. We've been paying a healthy dividend for more than 50 years. We also have a good track record of buying back shares smartly. As you all know, we've been in a period here for a couple of years where we've not been able to increase our dividend and/or buy back shares. \r\nIn terms of the low risk, we do have this mortgage issue that we're dealing with. I just shared an update with you on Sand Canyon's progress there. My perspective -- our perspective is this is a time-bounded issue. It will take time to resolve itself. But with this latest announcement, it's a good example of that forward progress that we are expecting. \r\nAnd lastly, but probably most importantly, is really stable management. For many of you investors and people that know this company, as friends of ours, that have been coming to these things for many years, I think it's a good sign when you see many -- the same members of management here in the stage with a consistent view year-to-year on our strategy and our execution. \r\nIn a business model that executes only one time a year for most of our clients, it is important to have a view of the medium and long term.\r\nSo with that, I wanted to go into a bit more detail with you. This is a tax industry view back to 1952, and what I'm showing you here is the number of returns get filed here in the United States. The same graph, by the way, is the same in Canada and Australia. Obviously, the x-axis would be different. There is a 97% R-squared correlation to nonfarm employment. This is an employment-driven industry. And it's nice to be in a business that despite recession and wars and economic cycles is pretty resilient at 1% to 2% growth. I mentioned just in the last page, this concept around pricing power. We measure pricing power in the assistive side at 0.1. What that means is for a 1% change in price, we would expect only a 10 basis point impact on volume. This is one of the realities of our business model and something that Block has invested a lot of effort into. It is a strategic opportunity for us to take that 1% to 2% base level volume growth and be able to grow on top of that. \r\nThis is a graph that shows you how people like to get their taxes done. We've shown this to you before, there's nothing new here. 60% of Americans like to get someone to help with their taxes, and 40% like to do it themselves. The emotions that drive that are listed on the right-hand side. These are very pervasive. This is a very big deal for people. It is a very clear categorization how people think about taxes. The only thing that has really changed, by the way, is in the DIY space. And I think Jason did an exceptionally good job of actually walking back through the history of this industry to show that when it started, all pen and paper to what it is today, is almost the exact same number. What has changed is those individuals that used to go to the post office, pick up the tax forms, kitchen table, shoebox, pencil and did their taxes. Those people have chosen to outsource their calculations to software, okay, initially, done through the DIY desktop, which was software in a box, but increasingly as Internet is more pervasive and people more comfortable with the cloud through SaaS based offerings, which is the online. The ability for that industry to grow is slowing down quickly as the remaining amount of pen and paper people are almost nonexistent. The only changes that we've seen in the last few years is the number of people doing DIY are driven by fraud. If it wasn't for the issue around fraud, specifically, the EIC migration, based on the unlevel playing field between assisted and DIY, the DIY industry would have actually shrunk. \r\nThe overall industry we operate in is a very big one at $19 billion. The vast majority of revenues here actually go through the assistance side. You've seen that from us several times, only 10% go through the DIY space. If you look at it by competitor, though, the map changes a lot. Although Block is the largest competitor in the space, we only have 15% of the share. All the other branded competitors, which include both assisted and software are a little bit less than we are in total. Our biggest opportunity, as time goes on, is to continue to address the issue that we see in the appended side. They  represent 44% of the market. And Sean did a really nice job talking to you at a very practical level about how we see that industry unfolding, the issues within that and the opportunities that we see in the short-term and, of course, in the long term, as we believe, standards will go up. \r\nBlock knows taxes better than anybody. Not only did we invent this industry, but we have been the source of every major innovation this industry has seen from day one. This is an industry, as you think about it playing over the next 10 years, you have to think about how each competitor's going to shake out of this conversation, and we believe that Block is the best position. \r\nOne of the reasons we say that is that we have a brand that's unmatched in the space. We have a brand awareness of 98%, which is on par with major well-known consumer brands across the country. This is a direct result of billions of dollars of investment in marketing over decades. It is the direct result of us doing hundreds of millions of people's taxes successfully over decades. If you want to compete in the tax-preparation space, you have to automatically understand how you're going to differentiate versus Block because we are the name in taxes. \r\nNext is our reach. As all of you know here in the U.S., we have about 10,400 locations, roughly 40% franchise run and 60% are company run. That number is not going to change a lot. What we have been through in the most recent years is a specific downsizing effort with our investment into Sears and Walmart. We're finished with that now. And if you went back before that, there was a period, which Block expanded very quickly our footprint, which was a mistake. We're past that now. As we look forward, we expect to grow our footprint modestly year in and year out, which will be a source of growth for us. This is based off of our understanding of our customers, our data models and our ability to execute an operational model that understands that with $40,000 or $60,000 to open up a new store, we know how to make that run successfully. The population shifting in the United States, the competitive environment continues to shift, and we have identified pockets of opportunity that will lead to some consistent growth over the next few years. \r\nOur tax professionals. This is, by the way, from my perspective, being with Block for 2.5 years as the most amazing part of this model. For our client that comes into our offices and sits down to do their work with us, H&R Block is the tax professional across the desk from them. The vast majority of those individuals are seasonal employees. This is Richard Gartland, he's the face of H&R Block. He's not just another pretty face. He's actually a tax professional. Works for us in Glendale, California. I don't know if you know this, but he actually does a couple of hundred returns per year. In fact, all the requirements we've been putting on him the last couple of years in terms of our shooting and ads and TV appearances and stuff is actually getting in his way of serving his clients, which he is, by the way, pretty upset about. We hire, train, develop, supervise, place, compensate and execute tens of thousands of seasonal people in a very fast time period. It's this time of the year that we're actually in the middle of it, and me who gets to sit on the side lines to see an organization that goes from coast-to-coast to find these people and ramp them, it was really amazing. This is the biggest barrier for any competitor in the space, to find and be able to place seasonal tax professionals that execute with quality, and Block does it better than anybody. \r\nRetentions another nice benefit about being in this industry, simply because most Americans, including yourselves, will likely only change the way they do their taxes 3 or 4 times in their lifetime. The main reason that someone changes the way they do their taxes is because of a change in a life event. You moved, you bought a home, you retired, you had a child, you got divorced. These are triggers in which you may want to reassess how you get your taxes done. But putting that aside, the average tax preparer knows, with some degree of certainty, 60% of their clients are going to come back next year, which is not a bad business to be in. As you can see here, Block actually does 70%, which is a full 10 points higher than our other branded competitors. This is a direct result of all the investment we make in our people, and our brand and how we execute with service. It's something that we are very proud of. \r\nIn the DIY space, we are investing a lot of money here. You saw a lot of the specific examples of that today as our journey continues here. We are going to continue to overinvest in this area because we believe that Block is a very good alternative for many Americans to do their taxes. As a reminder, we are the only company that actually says we just want to be here when you do your taxes. We're agnostic to how you want to do your taxes. Now me, as a CFO, of course, there's an economic difference between the two. But we're in this for a lifetime, and we think it's important to have a solution that starts in the DIY and goes all the way over to assisted and all the spaces within -- between them. We believe that in the next few years, that competitive environment you see in the circle of chart on the right-hand side is going to change, and you're going to have to think yourselves who will be the winners and who will be the losers. We obviously think that Block will be one of the winners.\r\nOne of the main things happening in this industry is this introduction of pricing. So for the first time last season, we saw the main competitor in the industry turned to pricing as a competitive differentiator, and we believe that has short-term and long-term implications for this industry. Historically, within the segment, there has been of value subsegment and a premium subsegment. That is now going to collide, and we think turn into 1 segment. Okay, Block is well positioned for that.  On the higher end, these are the people that have the more sophisticated returns that typically pay more for their software. What we see from the industry leaders, they are putting the price up fairly materially in certain areas to be able to afford dropping the price in the low end. We also think that Block will benefit, not just to our DIY potentially, but even some of our assisted clients -- assisted maybe more of an alternative percent of DIY clients. \r\nNext is international. So I reported earlier on Australia, so I'm not going to touch on that too much. In Canada, we're about to start the same tax season. Roughly in Canada, as we do in the United States, and we've been seeing good growth from that team. The main focus for Canada in the medium and long term is really to become a presence in the DIY space within Canada. You probably don't know this, but Canada has been, for Block, about 1% market share in the DIY side, with the main competitor in the U.S. being the largest provider in Canada, too. That's over -- so Block is now entering the software DIY space in Canada and it's a medium- and long-term investment for us. \r\nThere's other opportunities that we presented here, both in Brazil, India and expat. And for us, these are smart, long-term investments. As I said before, the best time to plant an oak tree was 100 years ago or today. We've been in Brazil and India now for several years. We continue to invest money there because we think there's long-term investment or long-term return. The amounts of money that we're talking about, however, fairly modest and measured in a few million dollars per year. But those Economies are changing quickly, and we think that Block has a long term solution that will help its citizens and the government navigate an increasingly complicated tax system. \r\nTax Plus is a very important part of our overall strategy and really starts with the foundational nature of our relationship with our client. Most of our clients will come in to our office and spend up to an hour with a tax professional sharing with them intimate financial information about their life. It is a trusted relationship. 85% of our clients walk out with a big smile on their face because they're getting a refund. And we have learned over the years that if you have the right financial products, you can add value to the client's life and make some money at the same time. We've had good success in the last few years as we focused on Emerald Card and Peace of Mind, in particular, but never forget that Emerald advance and refund transfer are very important ways that we add value to our clients' lives. We're happier for this year, we have a new thing we can add value to their lives on, which is the Tax Identity Shield. This is an important product that's dealing within a very specific issue. Last year, as you saw from our chart in Bill's section, there were over 3 million individuals whose identities were stolen and someone else filed their tax return on their behalf. This is a problem, and we have a solution. \r\nNext, specifically, is the Emerald Card. And I've always believed and I think, as you heard from Bill, that this is really the crown jewel within the Tax Plus suite of products. The #1 reason I believe that is because there's been the fundamental shift really since the 2008 crisis and how Americans need to get financial services. Many banks are looking at their client base and saying that we can no longer make money on these individuals, we're restricted on the fees we can charge them and they're pushing them out of the mainstream system.\r\nBlock's clients, about half of them in total, are considered either under-banked or not banked at all. And yet, these are individuals that still need to have access to buy airplane tickets and paying utilities and living their lives. And that's why this debit card product has been such an explosion in the last several years and Block has the third largest program out there: NetSpend and Green Dot are 1 and 2 here. We've worked really hard to improve the features and functions of this product to make it appeal to clients so that they can use that as their year-round card, and we have had some good success here. As you can see in the bottom right here, we've moved our revenue per card 2 years ago from $36 a card per year to last year at $44. That's almost a $10 increase in 2 years, and we expect that trend to continue. We don't know if we'll ever get up to entitlement. So if you look in the table above that, the revenue per account that a Green Dot or NetSpend gets, which is in the low 100s. It's unlikely we'll get into low 100s, but I think it's very realistic to expect $50 or $60 or plus dollars as we continue to develop this product. \r\nSo next, I want to talk about the bank. I know that Bill talked about this right upfront, but I want to make a few things clear to you. One, we are going to exit the banking system. We're focused on getting it done. We believe, second of all, that the transaction we presented to the OCC, with our partners at BofI, is a good transaction and its merits will be approved. We have to be patient. The point at which we have more information, as we have done to date, we'll get on the phone and have a conversation with you. We cannot predict what the regulatory time line is because that's not the way it works. \r\nThe ACA and the tax care -- and the taxes in the United States are intersection point this year, and so I actually think the graphic here is perfect because we're standing right now in the middle of that. Up until this past year, ACA has been a notion. It's been an idea. It's been a concept for most people. But for the first time when someone sits down to do their taxes this year, will be when they have to sit down and face into the realities of their situation that relates to health care, and this situation will only get more complicated as the next few years unravel. People will have new documents, they're going to have more questions, they're going to have more forms to fill in and this is a great opportunity for H&R Block to demonstrate the value that we bring. We are investing real money in this area. You've heard a number of examples from Mark, but as a CFO, I'll tell you that this costs real money. And the reason we're saying investment is very specifically, this is not an expense for us. This is something that we believe will have short term, medium term and long term return for us. As you've known, for those of you who followed us last few years, we've also invested money last year and the year before, and we thought that was a good investment then and we think it's a good investment now.\r\nWhen this investment pays off, what we think about will translate are these following factors: New client growth. Based on the description you heard from Mark, do you think it's likely that people who go to other assisted-tax preparers, especially a lot of the ones that you saw from Sean in those pictures, are not going to be satisfied with the level of understanding that tax professional may have? The fact that their return changed a lot? We think some of those people are going to come talk to us. We think a number of people who are going to sit in front of their computers, because that's what they are normally used to doing and are normally used to handling their taxes and change in the tax law that way. For the first time, they say, \"My return were changed in a more amount -- larger amount than I ever expected to do, and I don't understand why. Because for me, I was counting on that money. So maybe, for the first time, I'm going to talk to somebody about that.\" And we want Block to be well positioned for that. Of course, there's a third pool of people, which are those who have not been regular filers who are now, because of the rules of the healthcare reform, required to file. For what it's worth, we don't think there's a lot of those individuals, but there are some individuals that will fall under that category. All the investments that we're making in all the different areas I just talked about in the previous page will have benefits. We think our current clients will see that and will become more loyal. We think as we attract new clients who maybe sampling us just for 1 or 2 years may see the value of H&R Block. And so we think that over time, they will also be loyalty retention benefits. \r\nWe are a value-based pricing system, which you can also think of as a form-based pricing system. We showed you a number of new forms, we will be charging for them this season. We will not be telling you how much that is because the reality is, a lot of the competitors are listening to this call right now, want to know what we're charging in and they'll take their position off of that, okay? There is pricing opportunity here for us for sure. \r\nAnd lastly is enrollment services. A number of people are very confused by the complexity of selecting health care. If you've ever had a chance to go on and look at  the health care sites, you'll only knew about 5 minutes to realize. This is a very daunting thing for many people. Should I go with the silver level? Should I go with the bronze level? What did they spend last year? What am I may going to spend this year? What's my co-pay amount going to be? I don't understand why there's so many options here. We think that Block is a trusted source and we've validated that through our research. Our ability introduced clients to -- as additional value add as a way for us to help them and, of course, make money and this is the partnership with GoHealth that we're very positive about. GoHealth has been a good partner, and we expect to have a lot of opportunities as we look forward. \r\nSo with that, let me switch more to the financial overview of the company and really start with some of the basics. This is just a graph that goes back to 1996. What you're seeing here is our pretax earnings. Generally, a good story, I mean, especially in the last few years, as we continue to work on this. Last year, we increased our pretax segment earnings from 2012 to '14 by $162 million. It's a good story. Our EBITDA margin, which is something I get a lot of questions on, I thought I'd addressed that, but everyone kind of knows we did last year, we reported 31% EBITDA margins, which was up from the year before and dramatically up from the year before. So as you can see from 2012 to 2014, we've increased EBITDA margin by 5 full points to 31%. If you actually take that number and compare it to the S&P 500, or we've also shown here the consumers index, we say we have envious margins for a reason. So these are the average S&P EBITDA margins, which are reported at, typically, in the high teens, 19% or so. Not a bad business to be in.\r\nThe other thing that I talked about is an expected range of margin with you. And up until this past year, I've talked about a range of 27% to 32% as a range. We've done a lot of work on that and unfortunately or fortunately out of that, there's been a minor change to that model. We're now going to say 28% to 32%, for what it's worth. \r\nThis page shows free cash flow and so the -- I'm sorry, the total graph actually shows operating cash in total and from that, you have CapEx. As you all know, we've been spending a little bit more in CapEx. Our normal expected range in CapEx is 2% to 3% of revenues. That's ticked up specifically, and I'll address that here in a page. Once we get past CapEx, of course, we have a dividend that we're very proud of paying. We take that out. But even then, we still have a lot of free cash flow. Free cash flow is a very important metric for Block and one that Bill and the management team are very focused on. \r\nNext, I want to talk, actually, specifically, about our CapEx investment. We do, as I said, expect CapEx historically to be about 2% to 3% of revenues, which reflects a mature business model that also is a service-based model, whose main investments typically are furniture and computers and software, but nothing in a material sense like many other industries. We do expect CapEx, again, this year to be about 5% of revenues. But having said that, and I'll talk about this at the end to confirm it, we expect that the tick back down to a normal range. \r\nNow at some point, as you all know, there's a difference between the way the cash gets spent and the way it gets accounted for. And so the other line shows you depreciation and amortization. And I want to be clear that we expect a big step up in depreciation and amortization this year. Last year was $160 [ph] million. This year, we're expecting at $165 million.\r\nIn addition to the elevated levels of CapEx in the last few years, there are 2 other reasons why that's going up. Secondly, is the fact the nature of the assets that we're buying have a shorter lifespan. And so as you can expect, the amortization, depreciation tables are a little bit more accelerated. The third, and actually probably larger driver than the second one, is the fact we've been actually buying back a number of our franchisees is here in the last year. In fact, this year, by the time it's finished, we'll expect to have invested over $100 million in buying back former company territories that we refranchised and are now buying back. We believe that's a good solid investment, but it has a depreciation and amortization impact on the short term. \r\nI mentioned this earlier and it's a topic that you'll be hearing from us increasingly as time goes on, which is return on invested capital. We think it's a better metric, but it's very similar to, obviously, ROE here. And we've shown you back to 2009, per year, what our ROIC is, so last year, reported 25% return on invested capital. By the way, this is with the well-capitalized bank and, the fact, we've been building up capital, okay? It's a number that we're focused on. When you make that -- and you continue the story and really talk about what's the inherent cost of capital and, of course, we do this math on a regular basis, it's one of the things I get paid to do is worry about how to optimize our cost of capital, you can see us, we're typically right around 9%. This is a very good investment return for people, and something that we're very focused on. \r\nAnd another thing I wanted to do on ROIC is provide some context for you here. So this slide actually shows you Block, we're in a green bubble. So 2013, and we have to do this on calendar year not fiscal years, 25%. The red circle represents the average ROIC for the S&P 500 and the bar -- the top of the bar is the 75th percentile and the bottom bar is the 25th percentile. So we actually will now talk about our speed [ph] having enviable ROIC margins and this is the basis for that conclusion. This is a good investment. It's a good, efficient generator of -- use of capital to generate the returns that we do. \r\nNext is dividends. As you all know in the last 2 years, we have actually been prohibited increasing our dividend. Right now, we pay $0.80 per share per year, which represents based on today's shift share price, roughly 2.3% yield. Historically, we've always been higher than the S&P 500, which I don't think is a bad thing for a mature company that generates this level of cash flow. At the point at which we exit the bank will be a chance for us to reexamine our dividend policy. \r\nNext, which is a little bit of the building on the concept of dividends is also the concept to share repurchases. For the same reasons, we've been prohibited from increasing the dividend. We've also been prohibited from buying back shares really for the last 2 years. If you put that aside though and really look since 2012, between dividends and share repurchases, we've actually returned to you $1.2 billion, which for a company that has a market capitalization of $9 billion is not a bad number. The other thing I like about this chart is we've indicated in the bottom line the average price we bought those shares back. So if you look back in those 2 last windows in '12 and '13 when we were buying back shares, we typically bought them back about $14 or so. Given the share price right now sits in the low 30s, mid-30 range, that wasn't a bad investment. Importantly at the point in the future where we may have the ability to buy back shares, we will always look to intrinsic values as a guideline about efficient capital and ways of optimizing value for you.\r\nThe broader concept of capital allocation is a simple model. I've shared this with you before, but just to reiterate, Job 1 for us is to make sure we pay the bills. This is a very profitable business, and we need to make sure that we continue to invest back into it. So step 1 is to making sure that we fund the operational liquidity needs of the tax business.\r\nOnce we get past that, we do think it's a smart investment to invest in the future. Today was a great example a number of those investments in real life. I want to be very clear with you though from a financial perspective. Many of these investments, in combination with the fact that we get to do business once per year with many of our clients, have multi years to pay back. They're smart investments, they have multiyear paybacks, but they do cost money in the short term. Once we get past the strategic initiatives, we, of course, then support our dividend. Our dividend payout ratio is approximately 45%. After that, we've always had cash left over. We have historically -- traditionally bought back shares, but obviously -- but the other thing is at this point with the bank, it really is a moot point from what we would do at this point. Job one for us, really from a capital perspective, is to effectively close this bank transaction and then we can talk about what level 4 will be. \r\nAnother idea that I get a lot of questions on so I thought we put a slide in today is really just talk about how we align value with you, our shareholders, with the management team you see here on the stage. We are a medium and long term based business model because of the nature of what we do, and we've tried to do -- work hard with the board to really understand what the right way to compensate is. On the left-hand side, you see the way that the CEO gets compensated and the right is myself and my colleagues. There's a bias here towards the long term and I think that's a good thing. \r\nNow in closing, I have 2 last slides for you, specifically, first is a market outlook and then the second one will be an H&R Block outlook. \r\nOn the market outlook, we do not know when the tax season will start this year. The IRS has not yet communicated that, but we do expect it to be late January, which is in line with the last 2 seasons. For many of you who follow tax season for a long time, the tax season has traditionally opened in the middle of January and it's really just been in the last 2 years that it shifted to be the end of January. We think that's likely to stay more permanent in nature. Why that matters for us is because our fiscal third quarter ends the end of January. So the implication of this is the majority of our transactions -- our economics and accounting will now be in the fourth quarter. \r\nThe next thing we want to talk about is what our expectations over the tax filing increase. It will be 1% to 2% in the industry this year, really based off of employment growth. However, within the 2 sub-segments, we think the assisted side will grow somewhere between zero to 1% and the digital side will be 4% to 5%. For the next few years, past this year, we continue to expect 1% to 2% overall. We think assisted will continue to be around 0% to 1%, but the digital will continue to moderate as the pen and paper filers continue to disappear. \r\nLast thing on this page is really about complexity, the complexity in tax law changes. This year is the heart of complexity when we deal with ACA that will, of course, unfold to the next few years. We also talk a lot about immigration reform and some other pieces of legislation. We also, by the way, have to worry about state levels, who increasingly or using the tax code as a way to generate additional income without actually increasing taxes. We think complexity is likely to continue, not simplify. How much, it's hard to tell. \r\nSo with that, let me turn more specifically to H&R Block here, and I'll kind of do this line by line with you because I know a number of you like this from a model perspective. So first, our compensation and benefits. A lot of the investments that we're making that you heard about today is really about people. We are increasing the number of people that are working for us and we're paying them more. You saw that a little bit here in the second quarter and that trend will continue. We expect this year for a dilution of roughly $0.04 a share. Once we get past this year, which is really the height of some of these investments, it will then moderate back to typical wage inflation, which would be 2% to 3% and we wouldn't really spec it out at that point in time. Secondly is training costs. As you heard from the ACA, but also this new system we're putting in, Blockworks, we're expecting and are seeing a big increase in our training budget, which, again, is an investment in our future. That specifically will be a dilution this year of about $0.05 per share that will moderate over the next few years to $0.02 to $0.03 of dilution. Those 2 things, in combination with a number of other things, which includes of course costs from productivity work that we're doing, will result in a drop of our EBITDA margin from last year of about 31%, we expect it to be about 30% this year. Just to be clear, the compensation and benefits and training costs I've outlined are included in that number. Once we get past this year, we continue to believe that EBITDA margin percentage will be somewhere between 28% to 32%. I want to be very clear on a major point here. Our objective is not to have EBITDA margin continue to grow by itself. Our goal is to get revenue to grow at a greater than 4% rate. And we're prepared to invest productivity back into getting that number to be more sustainable over time. That will then have natural margin expansion at that point in time. A lot of what we're doing is the cost we're taking out of the company, we are reinvesting back in the top line growth we think will pay back over the next few years. \r\nNext is CapEx. I talked about this earlier, but just to confirm, we expect this year to spend about 5% of revenues on CapEx, but that will go down here very shortly to 2% to -- 3% to 4% of revenues. And depreciation, to confirm the number for this year, we think somewhere between $160 million to $170 million. That number will stay elevated because of the 3 reasons I mentioned earlier all the way through fiscal year '19. This is one number that we see have several models a little bit out of sync on, so we want to be very explicit with you today on. \r\nNext is interest expense. Many of you know that we had a medium term note that was due here this October at a principal amount of $400 million. We chose to pay that down and that will result in interest savings for us this year. This ultimately, of course, gets wrapped up into what does our capital structure look like in a world where we don't have a bank. We don't have the answers to that right now. We felt, given the fact that we have an abundance of capital available to us, refinancing some debt just to say we're refinanced, it wasn't a smart thing for you, our shareholders, and that's why in the short term, we chose to pay down. It's not -- by any means, you shouldn't read that as a permanent change in our capital structure. Next is our tax rate. This year, we're expecting our tax rate to be somewhere between 35.5% to 36.5%. That is now going to be 3 years in a row where we've been in and around that range. Importantly, though, this year and the previous 2 years, that was really driven by a number of onetime events that we were able to structure and realized, which had good economic impact, it also allowed us to repatriate cash into the U.S. in a very smart way. Having said that, our long term objective is to focus on our base tax rate of 39% and bring that down. And we do have a number of things we're doing to bring that down. And at some point in the future, I'll talk to you more specifically about that. \r\nAnd then lastly, just to confirm, I think the obvious here, because of our inability to buy back shares, we expect the number of diluted shares outstanding to be about 278 million which is no real big change, and as we look out past this year, it's certainly to be contingent on the bank sale on the capital allocation. So hopefully, that helps from a more model perspective. But really just in closing, I think it's important to summarize what we talked about with you today. We think that Block represents a great growth opportunity, provides real value to you along the way, and generally, we think this is all done in a low-risk environment. Thank you, again, for braving the weather, spending your time with us this morning. We're going to take a very quick break, put some chairs up here and then open up for Q&A. So again, thank you.\n\n---\n\nSo we are set up here and we'll get started here in just 1 second. Just wanted to quickly remind everyone that the slides for today's presentations will be posted to our Investor Relations website later this afternoon and the transcript will be posted Monday. As we come around, so we will have microphones for all those of you who are asking questions. We just like for you to state your name, your company and then ask your question. We'll call on you at that time. \r\nOkay. So if you have a question, just raise your hand, we'll come around and get you. Scott?",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Colby Brown (Executives)】\nGood morning, everyone. I need you to take your seats really quickly. We'll get started here. Well, good morning, everyone. Thank you for braving the New York weather and coming to join us today. It's -- we're obviously based in Kansas City, where it's a balmy 55 degrees and sunny today. So I apologize for not bringing that up here with us. My name is Colby Brown. I'm the Vice President of Investor Relations. On behalf of the entire H&R Block management team, it's my pleasure to welcome all of you here as well as those of you participating via the webcast to H&R Block's December 2014 Investor Conference. We have an informative and exciting day planned and are glad you're able to join us. \r\nBefore we get started, we have a few housekeeping items to take care of. Yesterday, we released our fiscal 2015 second quarter results. That release, as well as today's presentation, includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. We reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP figures in the schedules attached to the press release, and you can find both the release and the schedules on our Investor Relations web page at hrblock.com. \r\nI'd also like to remind everyone that today's presentation and various comments made in connection with it will include forward-looking statements as defined under the securities laws. Such statements are based on current information and management's expectations as of this date and are not guarantees of future performance.\r\nForward-looking statements involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Thus, our actual and results could differ materially. You can learn more about these risks in our Form 10-K for fiscal 2014 and our other SEC filings. H&R Block undertakes no obligation to publicly update these risk factors or forward-looking statements.\r\nShortly after this morning's presentation is concluded, we'll post the slides on our website. And later this week, as a reminder, our webcast will be available for replay. To give you a sense of the agenda for today, opening presentations will run until approximately 10:00 Eastern. We'll then take a 15-minute break. Refreshments will be available throughout the morning. And a quick logistical note, restrooms are out the door and to your right. We then expect the Q&A to begin around 11:30 Eastern. So again, welcome, everyone. We're excited that you're here. Thank you for coming and we hope you enjoy the presentations.\r\n[Presentation]\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: William Cobb (Executives)】\nGood morning, everybody. I want to thank CNN for my star turn, my little 4 minutes of fame. But I want to welcome you to this year's investor conference. We are pleased to have you join us. We'll review our fiscal 2014 performance and share with you where we see our opportunities for this coming tax season and beyond. \r\nSo today, we will share with you a recap of our performance in fiscal 2014, the opportunities we see going forward and why we believe we're well positioned to drive value for our shareholders. But first, I want to address the elephant in the room, so to speak, and that is a few words about the bank.\r\nSo we've had some people asked, \"Why are you even doing an investor conference this year?\" The thinking being that the bank divestiture is incomplete and we have nothing else to talk about. Now we did think we'd be done in time for this tax season. And as you know, we're still waiting for a decision from the regulators. But to be absolutely clear, we remain committed to divesting our bank and we expect BofI to be a solid partner. The regulators said that they needed more time. Like I said back in October, we can scratch our heads all we want. But they have been very thorough, extremely professional and we're going to take them at their word. We still believe that, on its merits, this transaction will be approved. \r\nSo the truth is we're holding this conference because we have a lot of great things to tell you. And at the end of the day, if anything is crystal clear, I hope it's what I firmly believe to be true: That no one understands taxes like we do, no one understands the industry like we do and, most importantly, no one understands the behaviors and needs of our clients like we do. So with that as a foundation, I'm going to start off with an overview, then the other presentations will provide the deeper context. \r\nAs most of you already know, we're the world's largest tax preparer. We're entering our 60th tax season here in the U.S., got over $3 billion in global revenue in fiscal 2014, which is more than all of our branded competitors, assisted and digital combined. \r\nSince 1955, we've filed over 650 million tax returns. And this past season, we filed over 24 million returns worldwide. And that's across more than 10,000 offices globally staffed by tens of thousands of tax professionals and associates worldwide. Clearly, Americans know us, use us and love us. We file 1 in every 7 U.S. tax returns. In fact, if you count all the branded tax preparers who sign their clients' tax returns, H&R Block tax pros signed 7 out of 10 of all these. Why? Because Americans know we are the most knowledgeable, the most accessible in the industry and we'll do their taxes right. And that value is delivered by our tax pros and associates who are the best in the industry. \r\nOur tax pros have an average tenure of 8 years and over 450 hours of training. We have over 7,500 enrolled agents, the highest credential awarded by the IRS. We have CPAs. We have attorneys. Over 1/3 of our tax pros have achieved certification as an H&R Block master tax adviser, which is our highest internal credential. Our tax pros are experts who go well beyond just simply answering tax questions. They are advisers to our clients. They prepare and sign our clients' returns and that's a very personal connection. \r\nAnd while our history is founded in assisted tax preparation, we're also making quite an impact on the DIY side. We've come a long way from our earlier DIY products to today's innovative and redesigned software that positions us well for the future. And while we are proud of our accomplishments here in the U.S., we're also proud of our global operations. This coming season, we're celebrating our 51st year in Canada. And at the end of October, we completed our 44th tax season in Australia, including the launch of a new DIY product there. \r\nAnd as many of you know, we entered India and Brazil a few years ago. We also have an emerging ex-pat business. And a point you may not be aware of, we have 28 tax offices on or near U.S. military bases around the world serving our armed forces. None of our competitors can say that. \r\nSo now let's take a closer look at our performance this past fiscal year. Strong execution in 2014 based on our Tax Plus revenue growth strategy drove increased revenue, productivity and profitability. Total revenues rose $118 million, up 4% to over $3 billion. Complementing this revenue growth, EBITDA increased 8% to $940 million, which is an improvement of 24% since fiscal 2012. In fact, EBITDA margin grew 1 point to 31% of revenues in fiscal 2014. \r\nOverall, we continue to focus on driving profitable growth in assisted and digital and in our adjacent Tax Plus products. \r\nIn assisted, we maintained our strong focus on clients. We prepared and filed 13.6 million U.S. returns, which was 17% of the assisted category. In digital, we saw double-digit growth in revenue. And although our growth in return count slowed, our strong execution and conversion and monetization led to this growth, marking the fourth year in a row now we've gained revenue share. And in a rapidly maturing industry, we think that's a very important measurement. \r\nAnd we saw a continuing progress with our Tax Plus strategy, which improves client service by offering integrated adjacent products. \r\nIn 2014, revenues from our Tax Plus products increased 11% to $432 million. I'll talk about the performance of our Tax Plus products in more detail later this morning. But 2 key points here are that the tax preparation business and adjacent financial services products are clearly synergistic, which keeps our cost of acquisition low. \r\nPlus, these best-in-class products enhance the relationship with our clients, many of whom have come to trust and rely on these products year after year. All of this translates into driving value for our shareholders. In fiscal year 2014, free cash flow before dividends increased 73% to $663 million. Earnings per share last year increased 5% to $1.67. And in January, we will pay our 209th consecutive quarterly dividend. That's over 52 years and counting. \r\nAnd since I took over as CEO in May of 2011, we have returned $1.2 billion to our shareholders in share repurchases and dividends. This, despite, as many of you know, being prohibited from buying back shares since the summer of 2012. So we are pleased with our performance in 2014. Our direction is even clearer now as we've shed non-core businesses and are focused on tax preparation as our core competency. \r\nAnd as the #1 player in the tax preparation industry, it's also our role to lead the industry, to advocate for and to lead change that best serves the interest of taxpayers. You've heard me say that we don't take partisan positions on the tax code. Our job is simple. Do everything we can to ensure our clients receive the maximum refund to which they are entitled and to keep them out of trouble. \r\nBut that doesn't mean we shouldn't, as the industry leader, educate policymakers on tax administration. And there are 2 tax administration issues that need to be addressed. The first is the issue of improper earned income credit payments. In its most recent report this year, the IRS estimated that there were $16 billion to $19 billion in improper EIC payments, either as a result of fraud or complexity due to honest taxpayer mistakes, $16 billion to $19 billion. And we know this improper payment rate, as a percentage of total EIC filings, has been over 20% for the past 10 years and estimates for 2014 range between 24% and 29% of total EIC filings. \r\nWe also know that, among those applying for the EIC, there's been a significant migration from assisted to digital. This graph shows that the percent of those applying for the EIC who prepare and file their taxes digitally has grown from 28% in 2008 to 42% this past tax season. Why? I suspect, for some at least, it's because they don't have to answer as many questions to document their eligibility and we know there are some unscrupulous paid preparers who use off-the-shelf software to avoid the added scrutiny of answering additional questions and their potential liability because they don't have to sign the return. It makes no sense to have different documentation requirements. No sense at all. So we think that across all channels, all EIC filers, whether assisted or digital, should have to answer the same questions. Doing so would significantly reduce fraud and criminal activity, and we have told the treasury department that it needs to take action because the current policy makes no sense.\r\nThe second tax administration issue is the lack of minimum standards for paid tax preparers. Currently, there are no federal standards in place, and only 4 states have such standards. In August of 2011, the IRS proposed new testing and continuing education requirements for tax preparers. But that's now on hold until it finds its way through Congress. So this year, the IRS implemented a new voluntary program. While we would have preferred a mandatory program, we welcome the voluntary program and we'll support Commissioner Koskinen's efforts for legislation to regulate tax return preparers. We continue to believe strongly that America needs genuine certification that includes mandatory testing and continuing education of all paid tax preparers. I've said it before: Cutting hair requires certification in all 50 states. So it surely makes sense that certification of paid tax preparers should be required in all 50 states, too. \r\nAnd while H&R Block continues to lead the way on these 2 issues, the silence of others in this industry is deafening. Frankly, I cannot understand why only H&R Block is talking publicly about these issues. Most of the competition isn't and you should wonder why. It's either because they don't know or they don't care, or is it because doing the right thing will hurt their businesses. \r\nSo now let's get onto our lineup of speakers and the topics they're going to discuss this morning. First up, Kathy Collins, our Chief Marketing Officer. Her team has done extensive new research on consumer tax filing behavior, which she will share with you. \r\nNext up and playing hurt today -- these 40 -year-olds who are in great shape, they just can't get it together, but with a very -- a severely sore neck -- Jason Houseworth, our President of Global Digital and Product Management, he'll talk to you about the opportunities in the digital category. \r\nThen Shawn Moore, our Vice President of Development and Franchise Strategy, will break down the structure of the assisted tax preparation category. You'll get a better understanding of just how fragmented this industry is and Shawn will provide our insights. \r\nAfter Shawn, I'll be back to talk to you about investments in our core retail business, in technology, the look and feel of our offices and what's next for our Tax Plus products. \r\nWe'll then take a break. And near the end of the morning, we'll have the 2 presenters you're probably most anxious to hear. Mark Ciaramitaro, our Vice President of New Business and Innovation, is one of the most knowledgeable people in the country on healthcare. He'll talk to you about the impact of the Affordable Care Act on taxes. I believe we've committed more resources to this initiative than anyone in the tax industry, and Mark will show you what we know, what we anticipate and what we're doing in the space. \r\nAnd then finally, Greg Macfarlane, our CFO, will talk to you about our overall financial outlook. Greg will synthesize everything you hear today into a cohesive investment thesis for Block. So that's our lineup. \r\nI'm going to close now with something that speaks to the essence of who H&R Block is, and I think it's truly the most important thing I've done since becoming CEO, and that's to define what guides us, our purpose, our vision and our values. Simply put, our purpose is to look at your life through tax and find ways to help. It all begins with taxes and how we look at life through the lens of tax. Only H&R Block does this. \r\nFrom there, our vision. The carefully chosen words of our vision make clear that we are the leading global consumer tax company, bringing tax and related solutions to clients year-round. But to have purpose and realize the vision, we also have to be grounded in values. We do the right thing, simple and clear. I hear it echoed in meetings across the organization as teams address opportunities and challenges. And to do the right thing means we believe in our people, we take care of our clients and we deliver for our shareholders. We pride ourselves on doing the right thing. And that includes our absolute commitment to creating additional value in this company. We're proud of our track record. Since May of 2011, our market value has more than doubled. Free cash flow was up significantly, and share buybacks and dividends have exceeded $1.2 billion. But we believe more value creation is on the horizon, and that horizon includes exiting our bank. \r\nAnd on that point, I do want to thank everyone here for your patience. I'm sure this hasn't been easy for you. I know it hasn't been easy for us. But we remain confident we're going to get this done and create even more value in this great company going forward. So with that, let's get on with the rest of the presentations.\r\n[Presentation]\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Kathy Collins (Executives)】\nGood morning. I'm Kathy Collins. I am the Chief Marketing Officer at H&R Block. And today, I'm going to share an evolved perspective of the tax industry through the eyes of the consumer and how our understanding of that perspective is reshaping how we approach the market today. As I thought about our approach, I wanted to start by addressing key questions floating around the tax category. Is consumer behavior changing? Has the complexity of the tax code changed how we think about filing our taxes? Are people moving to DIY as mobile devices become a way of life or to save money? Is the H&R Block retail model still relevant? \r\nAs the leader in the tax preparation industry, we know this category better than anyone. In fact, we spend a great deal of time trying to truly understand the issues and questions that I just mentioned. So I plan to spend the next few minutes sharing with you our perspectives and what we have learned as we've studied the answers to these and other questions. \r\nFirst, let's set the stage. The tax prep industry is one of steady, but slow return growth, around 1% to 2% per year. And as you know, there is great diversity in competitors throughout the tax prep industry, with a large number of competitors in the retail category and fewer participants in the DIY category. Now Shawn and Jason are going to spend more time on the structure of the categories a little later, but I really want to focus on the consumer. \r\nH&R Block is, by far, the largest brand participating fully in 100% of the tax market. From assisted tax prep to do-it-yourself and anything in between, we serve clients the way they want to be served. Now what we've learned about the industry over the years may surprise you. For one, we have learned the decisions around tax prep are highly emotional for consumers. For many, it is the largest financial transaction of their year. It may trigger excitement or nervous, reluctance but typically, a high level of anxiety. \r\nSo as a brand, we must understand the needs that drive their behaviors so we can deliver flawlessly for consumers. But who are these consumers? What is driving their behavior? And how can a brand like H&R Block continue to grow in a slow-growing, seemingly un-innovative environment? \r\nAs the leader in tax, we took it upon ourselves to take a fresh look at the industry. We embarked on a long-term consumer research journey, which included a very large in-depth, qualitative and quantitative analysis of over 8,700 tax filers' behavior, attitudes and needs. Why did we do this? Well, at H&R Block, we love our data, but I wanted to leverage that data to an evolved level, to a level where we knew what the client's next move would be, maybe before he knew it himself. For starters, we really need to understand what outcomes consumers desire. What exactly do they want from their tax preparation provider? How do they then cluster together into viable marketable segments based on their needs? And then how do we market to them according to those needs?\r\nBefore launching this research, we took pride in knowing a great deal about all tax consumers. Everyone wants expertise. Everyone wants convenience and everyone wants a low price, right? Every piece of research that's ever been done will validate those points. But because of our experience, we know that there was more to it. \r\nAt H&R Block, we invest to better understand the entire spectrum of tax filers. Our digital competitors are focused on those who do it themselves. CPAs and independents simply cannot look at the whole category to this level of detail. And our branded retail competitors, they just haven't. But H&R Block has, with the simple objective of uncovering what drives growth in this industry. \r\nAll of this began with one simple insightful question. What tax jobs are consumers trying to buy? The #1 job that consumers want to buy is getting the largest refund. While it may be surprising to you, but about 86% of all H&R Block clients across all income levels receive a refund. In fact, getting a refund does not depend on income level. Now it's obvious that lower income filers are almost certain to receive a refund. But even at income levels up to $180,000, nearly 1/2 of H&R Block filers receive a tax refund. This is why last year's ad campaign, Get Your Billion Back America, featuring 1 of our own tax pros, Richard Gartland, was so effective for us. It was a broad message. It impacts everyone regardless of age, income or even needs-based segmentation. \r\nWithin just 4 weeks of that campaign -- starting that campaign, over 75% of American taxpayers knew the tagline. 90% of them tied it instantly back to H&R Block. Once again, because the idea of the largest refund unites all taxpayers. \r\nThere are other uniters. Everybody wants accuracy of return, security of their tax documents, being treated with respect. These outcomes are universal. They are important to everyone. But it's the differences among taxpayers that lead us to more targeted growth ideas. \r\nSo let me tell you about what some of those drivers are. The first true differentiator among consumers when it comes to tax prep is whether or not they want to buy help. That is whether or not they want assistance with their tax prep. Our study showed that 65% of all tax filers do want assistance when completing their taxes. This is a number very consistent with actual return data. The entire universe of taxpayers not rushing out to do it themselves, far from it. The perception of one's own ability is one of the most discriminating factors in our learnings. It had the most variance. \r\nWhile some are confident in their own abilities to file their own taxes and get the largest refund, most are not. And this number really has not changed all that much over time. In fact, historical filing patterns over the past 15 years showed that nearly 60% of the market utilizes assisted tax prep, while right around 40% does it on their own. But 90% of the total tax category revenues come from assisted tax prep, while just 10% from DIY programs. \r\nBottom line, the research tells us there is great consumer demand for assisted tax prep. The H&R Block business model is alive and well. It also reinforces that we need more targeted approaches based on consumer needs. So this is where the real work begins. \r\nThink about the universe of tax filers. 135 million taxees and filers. A closer look at them reveal the variety of segments. Each of these segments cluster clients who are looking for the same outcomes. Each segment is based on specific needs of consumers. Some of those needs are being met today, some are not. Now it's important to remember that H&R Block fully participates in every segment of the tax prep market. Our competitors likely participate in 1 or 2 of these segments. And while I'm not going to walk you through all of the segments and all of the detail, I'm going to highlight some of the behaviors that influence tax filers and some key learnings from our work. \r\nSo let's start with Jose. Jose is representative of the client who values speed and convenience above everything else. So Jose desires a shorter appointment length with little need for the relationship aspect of tax prep. He may be more cash strapped than other consumers. We can then customize the interview for Jose and the offering. First of all, we schedule Jose for 30 minutes as opposed to an hour. If we are running at all behind, we shoot him a text message to keep him updated. We welcome him and jump right into the interview. We eliminate any tax planning tips and we save those for his summary statement. And finally, we remind Jose of our no out-of-pocket payment option, which allows his tax prep fees to be deducted from his refund. So Jose walks out of the office having all of his needs met: convenience, maximum refund, tax expertise and paying nothing out of pocket. \r\nNow those filers that tend to complete their taxes later in the season are even more differentiated. Let's assume that Lori and Dan are in this later season segment. They are among the few who owe money to the IRS as opposed to expecting a refund. Their situation is more complex. They're waiting for financial statements and gathering all of their paperwork up until the very last minute. In their minds, only an enrolled agent will do. They view their situation as being too complex for just anyone to handle and there is no way either one of them will tackle this challenge on their own. Consumers like Lori and Dan expect their tax preparer to know everything about them. If anything material has changed in their lives, he will know that. They expect him to call them, pass on any reminders and find a time that one or both of them can come in and drop off their stack of documents. So Lori will walk in the office, she'll answer a few questions, hand over the goods and wait for the call that says, \"They're done.\" Now she will anticipate some forward-looking tax tips from her tax guy.\r\nLet's look at 1 more filer who is part of a group clearly differentiated by confidence and convenience. Stephanie is a DIY-er. She is confident in our own ability to complete her tax return. She doesn't mind the challenge and feels that it is worth the time and effort. After all, for Stephanie and others like her in this segment, it's all about the lowest price. She simply believes that it is too expensive to pay someone else to do her taxes and she wants to invest as little as possible to get this job done. She also doesn't believe that the risk of preparing her own taxes is any greater than having someone else do them. She loves the sense of accomplishment she feels when she does complete the task. Now we know that Stephanie may reach a point of uncertainty while completing her own taxes, so we may pop up some sort of a window with a relevant tax tip or an invitation to chat with a tax professional during her interview process. And while there is a lot of inertia in the tax prep category, about 86% of all filers return to the same tax prep method they used the year prior. People do not always stay within 1 segment. There is some movement. Even the largest DIY player in the industry sees about 25% of their clients leave every year. That movement is typically the result of a life event or a life stage change. In the most general terms, complexity sparks uncertainty and uncertainty may drive filers to a tax professional. \r\nSo let's see how this all plays out over the life of a taxpayer. A 21-year-old starting out oftentimes looks for assistance from his parents from the -- for the right tax prep method. After a few years, he may try DIY, trusting in his own abilities to get the job done. As that young adult ages, life gets more complex. By 40, they have marriage, kids, homeownership, oftentimes, new jobs or even their own business. By 60, they may have divorce or death of a spouse and they've hit their peak income. They likely have some investments. Their tax complexity is still high, but will soon start to drop off. So taxpayers may switch segments a couple of times throughout their lives. \r\nSo you and as investors may be saying, \"So what?\" Here's the so what in all of these. At H&R Block, we understand client needs unlike anyone else in the industry. We have all this data. We know what people want. And now we have to bring it to life. Consumers expect more today, so we must use tools and practices to reach them directly, the right way. So the beauty of having all of these data, this in-depth understanding of our clients is that we have now typed our database. What does that mean? It means that we have assigned a segment designation to every consumer in our database based on a proprietary algorithm. From there, we are able to customize every client experience as well as our marketing initiatives. And what's even more powerful for client growth, our algorithm can be applied to people who are not yet our clients as well.\r\nPreviously, we were only able to use those records to identify clients based on age, income or tax forms filed. He's a 1040. She's a younger 1040EZ. The problem with that, demographics and forms are not indicative of behavior. To complement this consumer intelligence, we have also invested significantly in our own new CRM, customer relationship management system through both campaign managements and real-time decision-making. So with every person in our database, we maintain a golden record of that person; who he is, what segment he falls into, how he has responded to marketing stimulus, et cetera. \r\nSo for those who have opted in for a more personalized approach to marketing, we're excited about some of the new capabilities that are brought to life in the following examples: Our targeted marketing initiatives become, in some cases, as simple as a single keystroke, where, for example, clients will receive a product offer via e-mail at a discounted price the week they receive their W-2s, all based on past behavior. We can then tie those consumer segment needs right back to our marketing plans. \r\nSo here's how I look at our marketing structure at H&R Block. First, we have our national strategy. We build our story around what we can own and what is most relevant to our consumers. We call this air cover, which is primarily broadcast as well as screen cover, our interactive marketing initiatives. These 2, air cover and screen cover, are our version of mass marketing. \r\nLast year, our air cover was around getting the greatest refund, Get Your Billion Back America. It's about who we are as a brand, what we can deliver and what makes us better. The second level of marketing is what we call win the block. This is our local marketing approach that focuses on single-mindedly driving consumers into our local offices. \r\nAnd the final level is what I've been talking about today. We are now able to leverage the data with a more customized direct-to-consumer approach. We target our clients with the right message, in the right channel at the right time. So for example, Lori and Dan, that I spoke of, we know they are late-season filers. We shoot them an e-mail newsletter that speaks specifically about relevant tax tips. We can go even deeper and target those being impacted by a new tax code change with a very specific message about what it means to him or her. Another example, for the Joses that I told you about, we will introduce a geo-targeted mobile advertisements and alerts because we know this segment is most reliant on their mobile devices. \r\nAnd let's look at my earlier example of Stephanie, our DIY-er. She files in early February each year. And if we noticed that she hasn't filed by February 10, we can send her an e-mail, possibly a discount offer, to remind her that we are the right brand for her and we have the product that best meets her needs.\r\nH&R Block invented and has evolved the tax industry, which is alive and thriving 60 years later. What I've talked about today, it's a work in progress, it's an evolution, but we will continue to innovate. We will test and learn. And by understanding more about our clients than anyone else, we're positioned to do just that. Thanks for your time.\r\n[Presentation]\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Jason Houseworth (Executives)】\nGood morning. I'm Jason Houseworth, President of Global Digital Tax Solutions and Product Management. My role is to create great experiences for our tax clients, starting with our digital tax business as well as leading the client experience for all of our tax products in my dual role as Head of Product Management. Today, I plan on providing you with a brief scorecard summarizing tax season '14, before discussing the evolution of the DIY category, finishing with my perspective on what it will take to lead in digital. \r\nSo let's begin by walking through our scorecard for the digital business in tax season 2014, a year highlighted by double-digit Tax Plus revenue growth, which was our primary objective for the year. The one in which we did not move the needle in terms of top of the funnel awareness that H&R Block makes tax software and therefore we saw little client growth. Growing awareness continues to be our #1 opportunity as a business. And as discussed at last year's investor conference, we launched year 1 of our product redesign last season, the first in a wave of changes that will literally change every 1 of our 6,000-page federal and state online products. Obviously, a big undertaking, but one that I believe couldn't have gone better. We improved conversion and we saw our contact rate or the percentage of contacts per registered unit materially drop. But the most important result of the redesign was the monetization we saw driving our double-digit revenue growth. I mentioned last year, during our investor conference, that we believe the redesign would improve the value perception a user has within the experience and we saw this result as a validation of our product innovation and testing process. \r\nHowever, it was only Phase 1. While mobile usage continues to explode, Phase 2 will ensure that every single page will be responsive. That is to say it will appear as if it was designed for the respective Smartphone or tablet device. This is clearly an opportunity, given our conversion on both of these devices dramatically trails our desktop and laptop results. \r\nI'll talk more about the importance of adapting all of our pages to be responsive later. But first, I'd like to talk to you about the do-it-yourself or DIY category. And as Kathy just referenced, this is the 40% of the overall tax market that says, \"I'll do it myself.\" And that's versus the 60% of assisted filers, who prefer having someone help prepare their taxes. Now the DIY category is where I'm focused on serving and, unlike assisted, is one that has involved significantly over the past 20 years. \r\nToday, I'm going to review how DIY, as a category, has evolved, where we've been and where we are headed, along with what it will take to lead going forward. \r\nI'm going to start back when DIY was nearly all pen and paper in 1992; a time at which the category had roughly 55 million taxees and returns. Desktop was the first major shift, and its emergence for use in tax preparation was recognized by Intuit and H&R Block, with Intuit buying Chipsoft, the father of Turbotax; and H&R Block acquiring TaxCut. \r\nDesktop software not only created the ability for DIY-ers to electronically file a return, it also simplified tax form completion through an interview-based approach rather than direct form entry. And as a result, by 1995, it had over 5 million users. \r\nAs the Internet emerged, tax filing shifted to follow. TaxACT was the first tax software to be primarily available online and it was the first to leverage freemium, the try-before-you-buy-it model, which gave even the reluctant DIY-er the ability to go and at least double check their work online for free. \r\nIn 2002, companies in the tax software category formed what is known as the Free File Alliance, or FFA, in order to provide low- to moderate-income taxpayers, the ability to file a federal return for free through the irs.gov website. This also had an unintended consequence of giving rise to a number of .com sites that are what I'll call pen and paper on a web form. Sites that were able to spend just $26,000 for an FFA membership by creating the most basic tax software. You've got form entry, automated the arithmetic previously done by hand, e-filing, but little else. \r\nEven though the federal preparation was free, these sites monetized the service by charging to file a state return. By 2004, online had surpassed desktop with 10 million returns filed using online versus 8 million via desktop. And over the next decade, the growth of online continued, fueled by growth within the DIY category, primarily from pen and paper, but also from desktop users as online moved from the software of choice to the method of choice, for the majority of the DIY-ers, by 2006. \r\nIn the past few years, the growth in online has accelerated due to the shift of Earned Income filers from assisted to DIY. And Bill mentioned this earlier, driven by the inconsistent documentation requirements for assisted versus DIY filing for this credit. \r\nIn online, the credits -- pardon me, the requirements to verify are nowhere close to the stringent requirements that are forced on tax preparers, driving what the treasury's own data has reported as a $16 billion to $19 billion in improper EIC payments, which leads us to the DIY category today. \r\nNow at 55.9 million DIY tax season returns, online is the overwhelming choice, encompassing what I would call traditional online laptop or desktop users, with a growing pure mobile, and then you've got the multi-channel mobile users, or those who use some combination of mobile and traditional screens. This combined group of online users now contains 40 million returns, or 4x the amount of desktop software returns, leaving only 5 million of the most ardent pen-and-paper returns. \r\nThis number is a stark contrast to the 55 million pen-and-paper returns present in 1992. But it's still roughly the same number of returns for the total DIY category. Despite over 20 years of change, including the introduction of desktop software, online or SaaS-based filing, free and freemium in online, as well as mobile and multi-channel filing. \r\nH&R Block has participated in the rise of the DIY category, nearly since the beginning. But we admittedly came late to innovate in the online space. In 2009, I would argue that we were like many of the small FFA tax solutions I mentioned earlier. We were simply pen and paper on a web form with supporting calculations and electronic filing. However, in 2010, we effectively relaunched our online product, not just with a new name, changing TaxCut to H&R Block, but refocusing our online product on streamline filing, including W-2 and 1099 import, adding audit support and representation for all free and paid products in 2011, becoming multi-channel in 2012 by releasing 8 new mobile apps, establishing MyBlock in 2012, in part to allow users to move seamlessly between assisted and DIY through a technology solution to keep their data and relationship with H&R Block, regardless of channel. And finally, last year, we introduced the first of a 2-year redesign to begin a path of personalization to ensure that the product adapts to each user, as they prepare their taxes online. \r\nThese changes, to refocus our digital business on winning in online, have dramatically improved our registration to conversion by 5 points and resulted in a 17% CAGR in online revenue since 2010. We've repositioned ourselves in preparation for further evolution within the DIY category. \r\nLooking forward, I believe we will see DIY evolve in 2 important ways. The first is how the small value competitors created through the FFA will lose their ability to compete on price alone. Our view is that the even when value DIY-ers expect more than what I would call pen-and-paper as a web form, given that price is no longer a differentiator and they will begin to move upstream. \r\nThe second is that the market leader, who is now using price to level the playing field with the value competitors, is continuing to fund its simple filer pricing by raising price on its most valuable, high net average charge clients. Schedule C and other more complex forms have been moved from basic to deluxe SKUs into premium and home and business SKUs, making this consumer pay $50 more each year. I believe H&R Block is well positioned to take advantage of both of these shifts. \r\nOur rebuilt online offering puts the expertise and tax services of the most of trusted tax advisers, together with innovative, easy-to-use tax software that is built to lead for what's next in the evolution of the DIY category.\r\nIn order to win going forward, tax software or digital category providers will need to acquire and excel at 3 core components. First, product innovation or what I'll more specifically explain as the delivery to the consumer of intelligence as a service. Second, a multi-screen focus to design first for the Smartphone and tablet device. And third, a brand that has awareness and can support the full set of integrated Tax Services consumers expect.\r\nWhen I look at where tax offer will evolve, it's important to start by understanding how technology and software innovation will change in applications used every day by our DIY clients. In these applications, consumers will see software that leverages my data that's in the cloud, as well as information from the network or a shared set of knowledge that exists, that many refer to as big data. \r\nIn order to deliver intelligence as a service, to answer much more complex questions, and a simple example is how Google is going beyond search by proactively offering content like driving time to an upcoming appointment I have on my calendar, weather for the location I'm at right now, and providing me scores for sports teams that I've recently searched. \r\nThis synthesis of custom algorithms, as they apply my situation to an abstract set of shared information, will not only create meaningful solutions to more and more complex consumer problems or questions, but it will also anticipate how and when to do it. The delivery of intelligence as a service will have many applications. And in tax software, it will drive the software to become more personalized. In our case, the personal data is as rich as it gets. It's the individual's tax return and related data. And our shared knowledge is our internal CRM or client database that Kathy mentioned, which has everything from the high-level segment to the detailed clicks that each user takes that provides us with an even more dynamic user typing. \r\nIntelligence as a service advancements will make each user feel that the software was not only designed for them, but is always a step ahead. Tax season '15 will launch year 2 of our product redesign and delivers an example of this by creating a personalized navigation for every returning user. We recognize their unique situation from using the data that they had last year, and then we build an interview that only contains the relevant topics. But this is only scratching the surface when it comes to our usage of intelligence-as-a-service. With our redesign complete, we've now created a technical foundation for a number of these innovations that you'll see release later this year, as well as in the next few tax seasons. \r\nIn addition to developing intelligence-as-a-service, leaders in tax software will need to design the delivery of their software to be multi-screen. We like to say that the rise of video-on-demand has created consumers with an expectation of play, pause and resume. Or it's an expectation that your solution should be one that I can begin at work on my laptop, continue on my tablet at home when I have a few spare minutes and do portions on my Smartphone. \r\nAnother way to look at it would be from a negative perspective, which we saw last year when we still had screens in our program, like this example, that were not designed first for mobile device. \r\nHere you see the same screen ready for tax season 2015, designed from the beginning for a mobile or one-column screen format. For consumers who experienced screens that were suboptimal, we saw a 20 point drop in conversion versus those that spend 100% of the online experience in a full-screen browser. \r\nI'm happy to report that in the upcoming tax season, all 6,000 of our federal and state online product pages will be fully responsive to all devices. Our product will make this look and easy and meet the play, pause, resume expectation of consumers but our view is enabling this and keeping up with the pressure to be multiscreen will be something only the leaders in tax software will be able to do seamlessly. \r\nFinally, with the online category continuing to consolidate value and premium with price no longer a differentiator, I believe that all DIY-ers, not just those seeking a more premium online tax provider, will have a shared expectation that tax expertise and related services, like help from a tax adviser and audit support, are delivered part and parcel, at a great value. \r\nAnd as I said before, we are well positioned for this. Our software is consistently ranked #1 in this area because of our support of live tax experts during the preparation process, and the worry-free audit support and in-person representation all clients receive after filing. \r\nFinally, both value and premium consumer expectations will demand these tax services be built upon a great brand. We believe that with our product improvements in place, our greatest asset, and yet our greatest opportunity is our brand. Awareness that H&R Block makes tax software currently stands at 60%, a number that dwarfs the value competitors because it has taken significant investment to achieve, but by increasing still represents the largest opportunity to challenge the market leader. \r\nSo I hope as you leave, in addition to taking some of the free tax software that's in the back of the room, you take away the following: The DIY category continues to evolve, driven by online, as a multi-screen web experience. The set of online solutions is also evolving as value and premium collapse, creating a sweet spot for H&R Block tax software, given we have the traits necessary to lead going forward. Thank you.\r\n[Video Presentation]\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Shawn Moore (Executives)】\nGood morning. My name is Shawn Moore, and I'm responsible for identifying competitors that fit into the H&R Block brand and acquiring and integrating those businesses into the H&R Block network. I would like to provide you a unique perspective on the competitive landscape within the assisted tax preparation category that you likely have not seen before. Then I will share with you that same landscape translates to an opportunity for H&R Block. \r\nBut first, let's talk about the overall tax industry. It's a $19 billion market where assisted tax preparation makes up the lion's share. And as Kathy detailed earlier, it's a stable market, largely driven by consumer behavior. Tax filers tend not to change providers, unless there's a significant life event, which leaves the player in this industry space to literally compete on a client-by-client basis. But against whom are we competing? As you can see here, there are only a few branded competitors in the category. We certainly pay attention to what they're doing. But quite frankly, they are not the greatest threats to our market share. The CPAs and independents combined, have 78% of the assisted market. Clearly, the largest share, and thus, representing our greatest competition. And if you break it down even further, although our brand can stretch to capture share from CPAs, our true competitors are the independents, the mom and pops of the industry. This is where we invest a lot of our time and energy. \r\nSo let's talk a little bit more about just who these independents are. You may not have noticed this, but you see these types of offices every day as you drive down the street. As you know, there are very low barriers of entry to the tax preparation industry. Combine that with the fact that it's a lucrative transaction, and it is no wonder the independent market has a multitude of owners and is highly fragmented. Many of these offices will pop up and only operate from January to April. Keep your eyes open this tax season, you'll see that income tax sign in the window of the strangest places. The reality is that our primary source to the competition is thousands of small businesses in which the owner is likely completing a large portion of the work themselves and operating in offices, just like the ones you're seeing now. \r\nSo how do the independents compete? Essentially, there are 4 competitive variables in the tax industry: building client relationships and scaling their businesses; developing a recognized brand that consumers will trust; as in almost all business models, price is a competitive variable, either through the structure of the pricing model or the actual price point and potentially both; and the last variable is quality, both real and perceived. So now let's take a deeper dive into each of these variables, as they pertain to our true competitors: The independents.\r\nMost independents develop their businesses through relationships. These are likely people filing their returns for the family and friends on the kitchen table. Once they tap out of those relationships and referrals, they're challenged to attract new clients. Thus, as illustrated in the graph, nearly half of the independents are completing less than 100 returns annually. These owners find out that it is very difficult to scale because they needed to establish infrastructure, such as marketing, technology and even furniture. This is why you see only 5% of the market completing greater than 1,000 returns. \r\nDeveloping a brand takes time and a significant amount of investment. Obviously, these mom and pops have a presence in their local community, but they do not have the marketing dollars or the resources to differentiate themselves and compete on brand recognition. Often, independents don't convey the fact that they do taxes, instead, pointing to their primary businesses, as you can see in these pictures, of typical independent offices. For most tax filers, this is their biggest financial transaction of the year, and who they have complete their taxes matters. A brand matters because it carries with it reputation and trust. The reality is, independents have names, not trusted brands. \r\nPricing is another lever that is often used in the industry. The question is, whether it's actually a differentiator in the assisted category. Before I give our point of view on that question, it's important to understand the 3 most common pricing models in the industry. First is charge by the hour, which is used commonly within the CPA category, where the clients are more complex and tax preparation is only one of the many services provided. \r\nThe second is fixed pricing, which is sometimes used as a bait-and-switch strategy, with additional junk fees added to the return. Junk fees are charges included on a client's bill that are hard to justify, such as processing fees and technology fees. \r\nAnd finally, there's the variable model that is based on the complexity of the return. H&R Block uses this structure, which generally acts as a standard for the industry, including independents. \r\nHowever, as you can see, prices vary widely in the independent category, exemplifying the low-price elasticity within the market. Owners can and do charge whatever they want. Those at the high end of the range may be including hidden and/or junk fees. And those at the low end of the range, represent those preparing taxes at the kitchen table and family and friend pricing. With such a varied approach to pricing, it's clear that independents do not use price for differentiation. They just use it as the primary means of making money. \r\nAnd to reinforce that point, H&R Block is actually below the median of the market. So with the relationship, brand and price not being differentiators, that leaves us with quality. In fact, the biggest differentiation in independent category is quality. And quality varies in the industry as greatly as price. Due to the small size of the independents, most need other sources of revenue to ensure they can pay their operating expenses for the full year. Therefore, it's not surprising that 70% of the independents expand beyond tax preparation and provide other products and services. \r\nHowever, these services vary widely, and some are not even adjacent to the tax preparation. We've seen everything from bookkeeping, to notary, to insurance, to wedding services. You name it. Many owners are just trying to keep cash flow high enough in the off-season to survive, which makes perfect sense. Or doing taxes is just a way to supplement their primary income. In either case, the multiple service offerings actually creates a lack of focus on tax preparation, translating to less training, less expertise and a lower quality of return. \r\nIn most industries such as food, transportation and healthcare, quality is a legitimate high-end variable. However, as I mentioned earlier, for some tax paper, the term quality may not refer to the level of service, but instead, the level of refund. Unfortunately, it is often low quality that attracts these filers. And what I mean by low quality is that the size of the tax refund certain owners provide is greater because they are not completing returns accurately. \r\nHow do we know this? Through our prospecting of independents, we have completed due diligence on hundreds of independent business owners. Our review consists of comparing our local H&R Block office returns to that of the independent, including EIC and other tax credits. We also go on site and review the documentation of the key refund generating tax credits and look to identify any unusual patterns. \r\nFor example, we reviewed several businesses earlier this year that had the exact same business expense deduction at the same exact dollar amount for every client. \r\nFinally, we talked to the business owners, and it's surprising what they're willing to share with us. It becomes evident fairly quickly whether we are working with someone who has a quality mindset. In fact, we are finding that nearly 1 in every 2 prospects we review have some form of noncompliance. And 1 in 4 are knowingly committing fraud. What this tells us is that many independents are differentiating their business by providing inflated refunds through fraudulent activity. \r\nI do this for a living, and the level of fraud in the industry continues to be shocking to me. Sadly, it's only getting worse. Let me share one more example. How many of you know who the fourth largest provider in 2013 in the assisted tax preparation category? It was Instant Tax Service, and it was not a small player. They had 150 locations and filed over 100,000 returns. However, Instant Tax was shut down due to egregious acts of fraud. Not just 1 or 2 franchisees, the entire network was shutdown. Often, you will hear of fines or suspensions or both, but completely shutting down a business is almost unheard of. \r\nI want to share a couple of quotes. First, from the court ruling where the court stated that Instant Tax prepared false tax documents, filed false documents with the IRS and encouraged others to do so. And the Assistant Attorney General of the Justice Department's Tax Division stated that Instant Tax \"grew large through abhorrent means.\" This included things such as filing returns without customer authorization and forging customer signatures. \r\nAnd what is terribly unfortunate is after this happened, the franchisees didn't stop doing what they're doing. In fact, we've seen prior franchisees from this brand replace their signs, switch their names, only to continue their past ways. \r\nHowever, though fraud and low quality is pervasive in this industry, there are honest, good businesses out there. We have had some initial success already and believe that through acquiring good independents or having independents join H&R Block as franchisees, we can achieve an attractive rate of return. Also, consolidating the independent space allows us the ability to expand and enter into new client segments, stretching our brand to areas in which we may not have been as relevant, such as ethnic and/or expertise markets. \r\nLastly, there's an arbitrage opportunity for us to take advantage of as well. We're able to acquire independents at a 3 to 4x EBITDA while we're trading close to 10x EBITDA. \r\nNow I mentioned the fragmented nature of the independent market earlier. Our focus is squarely centered on the independents that are completing greater than 100 returns, which provides us a candidate pool of 67,000 independents, locations and 34 million returns, representing $5 billion in revenue. We feel like this is a great opportunity for H&R Block, especially since we also know that the independent population is aging. \r\nIn fact, with 63% of the independents, 55 years of age or older, it's likely these owners will soon be seeking succession plans. However, these are not the easiest businesses to sell. Prospective buyers are challenged to find financing due to little-to-no fixed assets attached to the business. Additionally, these are relationship businesses, and owners want to take care of their clients and staff. \r\nAnd finally, almost any sale will require 1 or 2-year trailing contingency repayment. Therefore, owners need to be thoughtful on who is purchasing their book of business. \r\nFor these reasons, opportunity exists in the space for H&R Block as we are a reputable, capable buyer. Another advantage for us is the synergies we bring to the table that others don't have. First, we're able to offer high-quality financial products, on which we earn strong margins. Many independents don't even offer these products today. And if they do, they make little to no margin. \r\nSecond, our field management is the best in the industry. We have decades of experience in operating a company and franchise network. \r\nNext, with our footprint, we're able to provide a flexible, creative solutions by consolidating locations, selling offices and other hybrids. \r\nAnd finally, we have an operational infrastructure that is second to none; exceptional training, technology, software and CRM capabilities that can be leveraged for any acquisition or conversion.\r\nAnd the independent space is not the only opportunity in which we are focused. There's another opportunity right in our own backyard. Currently, our own network in the U.S. is comprised of over 10,000 offices, of which 60% are company operated and 40% are franchised. Generally, the company owned and operated are in the urban and suburban markets, while we prefer to franchise the rural areas of the country. And while we're not looking to materially change that balance, we're working to reacquire 650 plus core urban offices we sold to franchisees, essentially reversing a short-term refranchising strategy that was executed prior to 2012. \r\nThis year, we bought back a significant number of these offices. Unlike other capital-intensive businesses, this will be a long-term win for our company, as we are able to generate favorable earnings and positive cash flow to H&R Block's financials from offices that are company-owned versus operated as franchisees. \r\nSo in closing, independents constitute 48% of the revenue in the assisted category and are true competitors in the assisted market. Fraud within the category is astoundingly widespread, and many of our independent categories are leveraging it as their key value proposition. \r\nAnd lastly, the independent space is highly fragmented, and our ability to successfully bring the best of the independents into the H&R Block brand presents an opportunity for us. Thank you for your time today.\r\n[Video Presentation]\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: William Cobb (Executives)】\nAs I mentioned in our opening comments, I'm going to talk to you now about how we are investing in our Retail business and what's next for our Tax Plus strategy. The investments we're making underscore our deep commitment to remaining the leading player in the tax preparation industry. We are the industry leader primarily for 4 reasons. \r\nNumber one, our brand awareness. At 98%, we are well ahead of any competitor. \r\nNumber two, our scale. We have the fifth largest retail footprint in the country. At over 10,000 offices in the U.S., no one in this industry comes close to our reach. \r\nNumber three, the quality for which we are best known, our tax expertise. We have the best, most highly trained people in the business. \r\nAnd number four, what keeps us highly relevant, our innovation. And these factors all combine to give us a huge competitive advantage. But we know we have to continuously improve to maintain the very high relevance of this brand, to invest in key areas to make sure we continue to meet our client's expectations. \r\nAnd we're doing this in 4 areas: our technology, our people, our offices and our Tax Plus products. Let's start with technology. You may not realize this but H&R Block is as much a technology company as we are a retailer. We have to be. Our clients are digitally savvy and use digital channels. Further, we understand that an effective distributed network must be reliable, safe and secure, which goes toward our larger efforts of continually -- continuously enhancing the user experience. The first technology area I'll highlight is MyBlock, a great example of how we're enabling client interface, not just during the tax season, but every day of the year. \r\nYou should think of MyBlock as the client's virtual filing cabinet. MyBlock enables the client to upload and share documents year-round with his or her tax pro, to check Emerald Card transactions and balances, to schedule an appointment. And MyBlock also allows us to content market to clients with product offerings, news and other information that's personal and relevant to them. In essence, it's the glue that binds us to our clients all year long. \r\nToday, fully 5 million of our clients are using MyBlock from both retail and digital, and that number is growing. So our competitors often talk about big data but we're focused on a whole lot of little data, client data. And MyBlock is a remarkable capability that provides convenience, information and security. It's another example of serving our clients anywhere, any way and any time they want and from all platforms. \r\nAnd this isn't just a nice thing to do for our clients. MyBlock is having a real impact. Here are a couple of facts. We've seen a 350% increase from 2013 to 2014 in the number of documents that our clients are uploading. And during the peak filing period this year, some 200,000 of our clients were logging into MyBlock daily. \r\nNow we've also made great progress with office technology integration. We've invested strategically in our multi-channel approach for locating offices, finding tax pros and setting appointments and obtaining client feedback. And our clients are empowered, too. As an example, in retail appointment setting, clients are now scheduling over 25% of these appointments through hrblock.com in the .com app. Another example is our recently redesigned Tax Pro Finder. Clients are now empowered through a simplified experience. And this new responsive design enables clients to easily navigate to find photos and information on thousands of tax pros. And they can access local tax office pages too. So whether it's in an office, by mobile, through the web or phoning our call centers, our office integrations are matching expertise to client needs across all platforms, laptops, tablets, mobile. \r\nNow another significant improvement this year, we're also moving to a new private, cloud-based core tax platform that we call Blockworks. This is a huge step forward in the technology our tax pros use to prepare and submit returns. In our 60-year history, we've gone from doing returns with pen and paper to a single automated system, and now to a common tax engine as part of our multi-year simplification strategy. Simply put, investing in our tax preparation program enables us to innovate faster and further enhance the client experience. \r\nTo be clear, we're not changing everything this year. We are phasing in Blockworks over time to ensure a seamless transition. This includes ensuring redundancy and protection of our compressed revenue model and executing a rigorous training and certification program for our tax pros. \r\nNow my discussion of technology investments wouldn't be complete without talking about enterprise data security. Data breaches seem to be in the news just about every day now. It's on everybody's mind, and we are taking specific actions, such as continuously monitoring for threats and proactively defending against them. I'm not going to go into details here, but I can assure you that we've taken very important measures, such as hardening our network and training our people to mitigate threats.\r\nNow in addition to these investments in technology, we're also investing in our people. Enhancing the client experience all starts with our people, so we set aggressive client satisfaction targets. And over the past year, we increased our Net Promoter Score more than 3 points. We are now at almost 75%, which is a great rating. But we aren't satisfied. Our ultimate goal is a Net Promoter Score of 80%, a truly world-class level of service, and one that will place us among the top retail brands. To that end, we're also investing in our bench strength, hiring more first-year tax pros and more Spanish-speaking tax pros. We've also conducted extensive training for this coming tax season on Blockworks, on the tax implications of the Affordable Care Act and other complexities of the tax code. That's 2.5 million hours of training, which is triple what we did last year. \r\nAnother key part of enhancing the client experience is the physical environment of our offices. You heard us talk in detail last year about our multi-year plan to improve the look and feel of our offices, and I'm happy to report that we've made significant progress since then. Today, over 87% of our company offices have undergone a makeover, all with new signage, giving us the best-looking, most professional offices in the industry. And we anticipate completing the remaining 13% of company offices and all franchise offices within a few years. \r\nFinally, we're investing in our array of Tax Plus products before, during and after the tax event, which we believe present a unique value proposition to our clients. As I said in my opening remarks this morning, we were pleased with our performance this past tax season. In particular, we saw an 11% increase in revenue from our Tax Plus products to $432 million. We delivered with a singular focus on the client experience. \r\nThe Emerald Advance line of credit is an unsecured line of credit of up to $1,000. This product is unique. No one else in the industry has anything like it. It's offered to clients from November through January. We rolled it out November 24th, and we're getting a great response. Though the Emerald Advance has not been a direct source of revenue growth over the past few years, it does offer our clients value, as it meets their specific credit needs when they need it most. \r\nIn turn, over 92% of Emerald Advance clients return to have their taxes done. And because we have a relationship with our clients and have access to their information, we know who may benefit the most from the Emerald Advance. \r\nNow with the refund transfer, our clients have an easy and convenient way to pay for their tax-preparation fees with no out-of-pocket expenses. And enable -- and it enables clients without a bank account to receive a direct deposit of their refund. We sold 5.5 million units in fiscal 2014. So this has proven to be a very important product for a significant portion of our clients. \r\nRevenues from the refund transfer increased 15% to $181 million, and the take rate increased 180 basis points. \r\nNow the crown jewel of our Tax Plus products is the Emerald Prepaid MasterCard, which continued its strong performance in 2014. This best-in-class product continues to win awards for its combination of low fee structure, exceptional features and convenience. A leading consumer advocacy organization just named it the #2 best prepaid card in the industry for the second straight year. And it won Best in category Top of Wallet at the 2014 Paybefore Awards. This past tax season, we issued 2.4 million Emerald Cards, with a total of $9.2 billion in deposits. Revenue was up 5% to $104 million. And cardholder engagement continues to improve, as evidenced by increased reload activity. Total unique reloaders were up 14% in fiscal year 2014, which is a critical metric for our year-round usage strategy. This translates to the top line with 2014 revenue per card growing 13% over the previous year. \r\nOur Emerald Card strategy remains straightforward. More cards with more usage. And we're doing several things to increase its appeal like expanding our reload network and getting lower reload fees for our clients. And our clients can now also get joint cards, in which they can add 1 person to the primary card account holder's account: family, relative, friend, as long as they are of legal age. \r\nAnd I'm very excited to introduce, new for this tax season, a sleeker, more contemporary Emerald Card. It's no longer prominently branded H&R Block. And it's more contemporary look, better captures its status as one of the best prepaid cards in the industry. So I'm very pleased to unveil it for you today, the new Emerald Prepaid MasterCard for 2015. I would like to thank our design consultant, Brian Kaufmann, from Viking Global Investors for his inspiration on the new design. \r\nNow our fourth Tax Plus product, Peace of Mind, is a well-established warranty-like product that helps clients who are concerned about the potential of an IRS audit. Anybody who's ever received a letter from the IRS knows that feeling. Now POM guarantees our U.S. clients that we will represent them if they are audited, and it also guarantees that Block will pay up to $5,500 of additional taxes owed, if it was our error. And this isn't just for sophisticated filers. 1040EZ clients accounted for the largest percentage increase in POM take rates last year. \r\nOverall, take rates on POM increased 4 points to 24% as we improved the offer flow during the tax interview and engagement by our tax pros. \r\nNow before I conclude, I'm pleased to announce that we've added a new Tax Plus product to the mix this year. And with what we're seeing in the tax-preparation industry right now, this product could not have been more timely or relevant. It hasn't hit the street just yet, but I wanted to give you a preview of it here today. As you know, identity theft is a huge and growing problem. Javelin Research, which tracks the industry, reported 13 million identity theft victims in 2013, a 30% increase just since 2010. And of course, we have all heard about the major retailer data breaches. And that leads us to the growing problem of tax identity theft, where criminals use personal identity information to file a fraudulent tax return and steal taxpayer refunds. Over 3 million taxpayers have been impacted since 2010, 3 million. How has this become such a pervasive problem? It's because the IRS system is built around the Social Security number. And in most cases, the IRS doesn't have a way to expeditiously compare and verify taxpayer identity with W-2 information. The established system is clearly vulnerable. Just watch this clip from a 60 Minutes episode that aired in September.\r\n[Presentation]\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: William Cobb (Executives)】\nSo that 60 Minutes segment covered a lot of ground. So what you saw was a highly condensed clip of the original segment. But it captures the essence of the tax identity theft problem. So what exactly can consumers do now to prevent tax identity theft? Truthfully, not much. They can file their taxes as early as possible in hopes of beating the bad guys to the punch. But that doesn't work if they're waiting on key tax documents. They can work hard to protect their personal information, but that's often beyond their control. They can pay for general identity theft monitoring and alerts, which may be a good idea. But the truth is none of these currently protect consumers against tax identity theft, which is where H&R Block comes in. \r\nWe're doing something about this growing problem and that's why we're introducing our newest Tax Plus product, Tax Identity Shield. We worked hard over the last year to develop this innovative, affordable and effective solution to tax identity theft. Tax Identity Shield is exclusive to H&R Block, and we think our clients will welcome this solution to a growing problem. Here's what our product does. One, a pretax season scan to provide awareness of tax identity theft risk. Two, custom advice on how to reduce the risk. Three, a proactive defense to help protect future tax returns. Four, early detection of any fraudulent returns submitted via H&R Block with the tax e-file notification. And five, expert guidance and support with our restoration services in the event of tax identity theft. Another interesting point in this product is that we've partnered with Equifax to enable key capabilities such as the preseason tax identity theft risk assessment. We're very excited about Tax Identity Shield and really about being able to fill a need in the market. We'll be launching Tax Identity Shield in January nationwide. \r\nSo to wrap up, you can see that we continue to make significant investments in our technology, our people, our offices and in our Tax Plus products. And this is all geared toward maintaining our high relevance in a competitive market, to making sure we are well positioned for the future and that H&R Block remains the market leader. \r\n \r\nWe are now going to take a 15-minute break. Please return to your seats by 10:20. Thank you.\r\n[Break]\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nEverybody, if you could take your seats, we will get started in just about a minute. So if you can take your seats. Thank you.\r\n[Audio Gap]\r\n[Video Presentation]\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Mark Ciaramitaro (Executives)】\nGood morning. I'm Mark Ciaramitaro, and I lead our new business and new product initiatives, including our enterprise focus on the Affordable Care Act. \r\nSince the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010, the nexus of the law has been to enable health insurance enrollment for uninsured households. \r\nGoing forward however, you will soon see that the tax consequences will play an equally important role. In fact, the reality is that the Affordable Care Act has ushered in the biggest change to the federal tax code in decades. \r\nWith the upcoming tax season, millions of households will experience a new intersection between 2 highly complicated consumer arenas, healthcare and taxes. This intersection will take the form of new coverage requirements, tax credit reconciliations, potential tax penalties, and associated exemptions, new tax forms in just an overall increase in tax complexity.\r\nLast year, when we discussed ACA, we outlined the law's overall objective to increase coverage quality, affordability, and access using a number of tax-base carrot and stick mechanisms, including both the individual mandate and premium tax credits. \r\nWe also provided the preliminary view that a significant number of H&R Block tax clients could be directly impacted by ACA. At that time, there was and unfortunately still is, pervasive consumer confusion regarding the tax implications of this law. We also introduced our intentions to provide marketplace consumer enrollment assistance via our partnership with GoHealth.\r\nBecause the impact of the Affordable Care Act on the tax code is so pervasive, we believe that the combination of ACA with taxes will create new growth opportunities for H&R Block. \r\nWe also believe that we are well-positioned to capitalize, both in the tax category and with new related services. However, we are in the early stages with potential changes on the law -- to the law on the horizon. Therefore, it'll take time for this opportunity to fully unfold.\r\nOne of the biggest potential changes concerns the ongoing set of legal challenges to ACA. As many of  you know, there has been a history of litigation around ACA, both at the District Court and Supreme Court levels. \r\nWith regard to the upcoming Supreme Court case, King vs. Burwell, a decision for the plaintiff is coming somewhat could substantially disrupt the ability for millions of household to receive premium tax credits, in addition to undermining other key ACA provisions. \r\nThere is an enormous amount of talk and chatter on this topic, but frankly, no one knows what the outcome will be. What we do know for sure, is that regardless of the decision, there will be a significant tax impact into 2016.\r\nSo here is our game plan for today. We will start by reviewing the coverage results from 2014 with an eye towards understanding the magnitude of people that will be directly impacted by the tax consequences of ACA. \r\nWe will also share findings from a recent survey of our H&R Block tax clients regarding this new law. Then we will quite literally dive into a more detailed explanation of the major ACA tax impacts, and use a few consumer scenarios to illustrate the emotional dimension of these impacts. \r\nNext, we will lay out where we have made substantial investments in order to serve our tax clients and capitalize on this unique opportunity to demonstrate our tax expertise.\r\nWe will then provide a brief update regarding our enrollment services partnership with GoHealth, and we will close with our thesis regarding what we believe to be the headline opportunities that you as shareholders should care about.\r\nLet's start with 2014 coverage status. The technology issues associated with last year's launch of healthcare.gov have been well documented. While enrollments were initially slowed, by mid-April, over 8 million consumers had submitted applications nationwide. \r\nThe latest Health and Human Services reports indicate that as of November, 6.7 enrollees were paid up with their major medical plans, with about 85% receiving government assistance through advance premium tax credits. \r\nIt's important to keep in mind, however, that the total number of enrollees does not equate to the total number of tax returns because multiple family members could be included in a single application. \r\nBack in April, the congressional budget office projected 2015 enrollments would climb to 13 million and eventually to 24 million. But more recently, Secretary Burwell's staff provided their forecast of 9 million to 10 million paid enrollees for 2015. \r\nHHS now believes, it will take 4 to 5 years for the 24 million enrollment target to be achieved. The real take-home message to you, however, is that as marketplace enrollment numbers climb, so too will the specific tax impacts faced by tax filing households, which is one of the reasons, we believe, it will take time for the full effects of the Affordable Care Act to become evident. \r\nBeyond marketplace enrollment, there are other important ACA provisions that are influencing household coverage levels, namely the impact of expanded Medicaid in about 27 states. In fact, a recent study indicated that, in addition to the approximately 7 million who gain coverage via the marketplace enrollment process, another 3 million to 4 million gained coverage via Medicaid, for a total of approximately 10 million.\r\nRecent Gallup poll results reflected this impact with the reported drop in the overall uninsured rate from 18% to 13.4%. At the same time, the CBO and the joint committee on taxation issued a report that indicated, even with the growing marketplace and Medicaid enrollment, about 30 million people in America will likely continue to be uninsured. Thankfully for them, the majority should be eligible for exemptions, which would leave about 4 million people potentially paying penalties.\r\nWhile these studies provide a useful context around the magnitude of the ACA impacts, we wanted to gain a deeper insight into how our current H&R Block tax clients were affected. So we fielded a research study in August among a large sample of both our retail and digital tax clients. \r\nWe also weighted our results by age, income tax forms, and filing method to ensure a representative sample. The results from our study indicated that approximately 25% of our current clients, including both assisted and DIY, will directly confront ACA tax impacts either due to the need to reconcile premium tax credits, calculate penalties, or qualify for exemptions.\r\nMost were impacted by potential penalties or are likely to be eligible for exemptions. But this survey provided another important insight. Most experts who study ACA tend to see households in black-and-white terms that is either fully covered or uninsured. But our survey revealed a much messier reality, that almost half of affected households have much more complicated and frankly uneven coverage situations. In fact, we found that only half of households, were covered under the same health plan with many experiencing coverage changes throughout the year. I'll discuss this implication later, but in simple terms, it means many households will face multiple simultaneous tax impacts associated with the Affordable Care Act.\r\nFinally, our survey again exposed massive consumer confusion despite the law being in effect now for almost a year. You might ask, what's all the confusion about? Well, many are simply overwhelmed and mystified by all the information and frankly misinformation in the media. And those who are enrolled through the marketplace and received tax credits didn't even understand they received government assistance. \r\nAs a general rule, virtually, everyone is confused about the reconciliation process. For those without minimum essential coverage, many still don't understand how penalties are calculated, let alone the exemptions process or tax forms filing requirements.\r\nProbably the most important takeaway, we heard, was that now more than ever, our tax clients are counting on us to help them understand, first, if they are impacted by ACA; and second, if so, what that means to their personal tax situation, both now and in the future.\r\nWith that background, let's move on to providing a more detailed understanding of the major ACA tax impacts for the coming filing season. My intent here is to give you a deeper appreciation for what a typical impacted household might face come tax time. There are some in our industry, who would simply claim the Affordable Care Act is no big deal. While that may be the case for 75% of our client-base who have employer or government health coverage. For the remaining 25%, well, you can judge for yourself. Strap on your seatbelts, because as Han Solo famously said in Star Wars, \"we are going in; we are going in deep.\"\r\nLast year, we told you what we thought the tax impact would be; based upon our reading of the law, but we now have an even deeper understanding based on the first wave of formal IRS tax forms and instructions released in September. \r\nI say, first wave because we continue to work with the IRS around a number of areas where we still have important questions. Based on these instructions, we can now confidently take a deep review into this specific tax implications of ACA. We have provided each of you with a handout containing these forms and instructions just in case you have trouble sleeping at night.\r\nIn basic terms, there are 6 tax impacts related to the Affordable Care Act for filing households. First, there will be new tax documents that provide critical information regarding health plan coverage, and in some cases, premium tax credit payments. Next, all taxpayers will experience new questions regarding the status of each household member's insurance coverage for each month of 2014. As we discussed last year, there will be a defined process for reconciling the premium tax credits, households received when they enrolled via the marketplace portal based upon their actual household income. Those who are uninsured, for all the part of 2014, will face a new set of worksheets designed to calculate their shared responsibility payment or what we call the ACA tax penalty.\r\nAlong with the penalty comes a complicated maze of exemptions that many will likely qualify for, provided they filed the proper forms. And finally, ACA impacted consumers will have to deal with new tax form filing requirements, among the most notable being, restrictions around the use of the 1040EZ based tax form. \r\nLet's start with the new tax docs. First, we have the 1095-A, which for those that enrolled in either the Federal or state marketplaces is a critical document that indicates each household members coverage status and premium tax credit payments. \r\nThe 1095-A is actually a part of a new series of notices commonly referred to as the 1095 series. These notices come in the form of either an A, B, or C. A notices will be issued by the federal and state health insurance marketplaces, and you will see in a few minutes, that they are a must have filing documents. \r\nThe 1095-Bs and Cs will be issued by health insurance carriers, the military, the government, and employers. These notices are voluntary in 2015, but will become mandatory next year in 2016.\r\nAs with other similar notices, such as the 1098 or 1099, this information is not just provided to the household, it's also provided to the IRS for cross referencing. \r\nFor this year, consumers should receive their 1095-A notices from the marketplaces by late January, and we have been told electronic versions will also be available. \r\nThe 1095-A contains key information needed for the premium tax credit reconciliation process, such as covered family members, monthly tax credit amounts, and especially the premiums for the benchmark second lowest cost Silver Plan in the filers rating area.\r\nLet's now talk about how tax filers will verify their insurance coverage. As I mentioned, for the first time this coming tax season, each and every filer will be asked about their insurance coverage status. The good news is that household's fully covered through an employer, qualified private insurance or government plans will simply need to attest to this coverage. What this means is they will not have to provide evidence of insurance coverage, such as an insurance policy, and most will be able to simply check the box.\r\nAdditionally, tax professionals will not be accountable for any special IRS due diligence requirements associated with verifying coverage for family members. \r\nHowever, understanding the type of coverage, and who in the household was covered will be critical. Because if even 1 household member was not covered for any period of time, this check-box cannot be used.\r\nNext tax season, this all changes as all filers will need to provide coverage documentation. At this point, some of you may be thinking, okay, but what's going to prevent someone from lying about their coverage status? Well, the short answer is, probably nothing at the time of filing. However, the IRS has indicated to us that they have every intention of enforcing ACA tax provisions and they certainly have legal recourse to go back and take a deeper look in the case of suspected fraud for up to 10 years. \r\nThe more practical answer you will see in a few minutes, is why bother with lying when the vast majority of uninsured filers will be able to qualify for legitimate penalty exemptions. \r\nBefore talking about these exemptions, we will first turn to the reconciliation process.\r\nWhen 8 million-plus consumers enrolled via federal or state marketplaces, most qualified for advance payments of their premium tax credit. Come tax season, it's true-up time. \r\nIn order to fully understand reconciliation, however, we have to take a step back and talk about the premium tax credit, which is essentially government financial assistance intended to reduce the cost of insurance premiums for qualified households. \r\nTo qualify for a premium tax credit, the household must not currently have or have access to affordable qualified health insurance. By the way, qualified means the governments 10 -- it meets the governments 10 minimum essential coverage requirements. The good news is, most employer, government and private plans currently meet these requirements.\r\nSecondly, the household's income must be between a 100% to 400% of the federal property level. The actual credit they receive, ladders up or down based on income, family size, and zip code, because it's indexed to the second lowest cost silver plan premium in the applicant's rating area.\r\nNow historically, tax credits are typically claimed retroactively at the time of filing. However, in the case of ACA's premium tax credit, it's prospective, because the credit is estimated upfront and then actually advanced directly to the insurance company for each month the applicant is enrolled.\r\nFinally, anyone who receives premium tax credits must, by law, file a tax return. If they don't, they may lose the option going forward to qualify according to HHS. Now here are the typical Federal property level income bands that households must fall into to qualify for premium tax credits. \r\nIt surprises many when they see how high these income bands go. For instance, up to 94,000 for a family of 4. Also, household income for purposes of the premium tax credit is actually modified adjusted gross income, which is essentially your AGI plus tax exempt Social Security, tax exempt interest, and unearned foreign income. \r\nIt also includes a taxable income from all family members, not just the primary tax filer. In case you're interested, here's the actual formula used to determine a household's advance premium tax credit amount. Essentially, it multiplies the forecast of the enrollee's household income, times an applicable percentage ranging from 2% to 9.5%, and then subtracts that total from the premium of the second lowest cost silver plan in the households trading area, matched to the applicant's age, family, and composition. Got that? Don't worry, we do.\r\nWe are now ready to go a little deeper into the actual reconciliation process. \r\nStarting this year, tax filers must adjust the premium tax credit based upon their actual 2014 household income using a new form called the 8962. This process essentially follows 4 steps. Step 1 involves the determination of the premium tax credit the household was entitled to, based on their actual modified adjusted gross income on their tax return. Step 2, compares this determination to the advance payments actually received by the household, which if you recall, comes from their 1095-A. That's why it's a must-have document. Step 3, then adjusts the tax refund or taxes due based on the difference either with the repayment of the premium tax credit or an additional credit amount. Finally, for those facing a repayment, the law also created a tax liability limitation table. The table works like this. For those between a 100% to 400% of the FPL, there is a cap for any premium tax credit liability owed based on the household's filing status and income. \r\nHowever, household's whose income exceeds 400% of FPL will need to pay back the entire premium tax credit they received, which in some cases can amount to thousands of dollars. My guess is that you will hear lots of stories about these situations once tax season begins.\r\nThis reconciliation process has even deeper levels of complexity. For instance, there is a specific interview and allocation method for spreading the premium tax credit across separate tax filing households, such as for divorced couples. And there is an alternative process for handling, those who got married during the year. And for filers, whose household members changed or got employer coverage, but didn't notify the marketplace, well the 1095-A issued to them is actually not correct and a special approach will be required. But the law is ambiguous on this point. Any household that received advance premium tax credits must file a tax return with the 8962, and if they are married, they must file a joint return, and if they don't, their tax return will be held by the IRS delaying access to their tax refund.\r\nRemember, as I said earlier, when I talked about the 1095-A, the IRS knows who received tax credits, and is therefore expecting the 8962 with their return.\r\nIf they don't file a tax return they may be disallowed eligibility for future premium tax credits. And then finally, as I said, households near to 400% FPL level need to pay close attention to avoid paying back their entire premium tax credit. \r\nLet's turn now to tax penalties. As you know, the Affordable Care Act created a new mandate, which will institutionalize a new system of tax penalties for households without qualified health insurance coverage, which is applied on a per month basis. \r\nOur consumer research validated that while most households are aware of the penalty, unfortunately, their awareness was focused on the individual flat fee amount of $95 versus the percentage of income method. \r\nThe percentage method most often ends up with a higher penalty amount, and for that reason is probably the one, people should be paying attention to. \"Why?\" You may ask. Well, let's take a look at an example. Under the flat fee calculation, a 3 person household uninsured for all of 2014 with a taxable income of $50,000 would have a flat fee penalty of $285. However, under the percentage method, their calculated penalties are actually closer to $500. The IRS then takes the higher outcome of the 2 methods, and the $500 value gets carried from the worksheets into the tax return, assuming that household does not qualify for an exemption. \r\nIn sum, there are few key things to remember, we got in tax penalties. You'll sometimes hear the term, as I said, shared responsibility payment, when referring to the ACA tax penalties. That's its official name. Next year, those penalties will double to 2% of household taxable income or a flat fee of $325 per adult. \r\nBy the way, the maximum penalty is capped to the cost of a national average premium for an applicable bronze level plan, which is currently around $2,500 for an individual.\r\nThere's been a quite a bit of urban mythology around whether the IRS will even collect the tax penalty. But from what we know, the IRS has indicated it has every intention to fulfill its collection duties, even with some legal limitations. And if a household happens to incorrectly calculate their penalty, they will receive an IRS collection notice.\r\nNow let's pivot and talk about exemptions. There are varying estimates that 20 million to 25 million people will be theoretically subject to tax penalties in 2015 due to non-coverage. The not-so-secret reality is that most should qualify for an exemption to lower the cost of their ACA tax penalty or even eliminate it all together provided they complete and file using a new form 8965. However, from a tax filer perspective, the devil is in the details, as the challenge here is to find, calculate, and document which exemption they qualify for. Why? Well, because there is over 20 exemptions, and if you include the 14 hardship exemptions the number is well over 30, and each exemption type has different qualification requirements. There is 2 broad buckets of exemptions. Those that can be claimed on the tax return, and those that require a separate marketplace waiver application before the exemption can be claimed. The first bucket relates to the exemptions that can be claimed directly on the tax return and covers a wide range of circumstances, including unaffordability, short-term coverage gaps, government programs, residency status, and special group membership. By the way, those below the filing threshold are actually not required to file to claim an exemption.\r\nWe don't have time this morning to go into depth on each, but you can quickly see how many circumstances are actually addressed. The affordability exemption is an example of one that while potentially applicable to many households, is actually pretty tricky, because it requires the filer to document that the monthly premiums of either the marketplace plan or employer health plan available to them in 2014 exceeded 8% of their taxable household income.\r\nThe second bucket of exemptions includes those granted by the marketplace, and these actually have to be applied for separately before they can be claimed. \r\nGenerally, households that are members in particularly religious sects or those who have experienced to one of the long list of financial family or personal hardships may potentially qualify for marketplace exemptions. Within the hardship umbrella, itself, there are 14 distinct definitions ranging from eviction, foreclosure or utility shutoff to family hardships, to government program eligibility issues, all the way to the infamous \"Other\" category.\r\nThis is all well and good for deserving households, but the marketplace exemption process has 2 major issues from a consumer standpoint. The first is, simply lack of awareness since many of the uninsured household who experienced hardships would not have even gone to healthcare.gov to learn about them and apply. The second issue is the antiquated paper application process. Yes, I said paper. A few key points to remember for marketplace exemptions, is that each impacted household member needs to complete a 4-page paper application, which we've included in your handouts. There are specific documentation requirements for each hardship category, for instance copies of eviction notices or medical expenses would need to be attached to that application. \r\nThe time period of the family member's the exemption applies to also depends on the type of hardship. \r\nLastly, hardship exceptions are not permanent, and need to be applied for -- reapplied for each year. Here's a simplified flow diagram, outlining the steps involved in applying for a marketplace exemption. After completing the 4-part application, it needs to be mailed to an HHS service center in Kentucky. \r\nAt the present time, the marketplace is claiming a 2-week processing time, but we expect once tax season begins, that the processing time will take much longer, even up to 60 days, depending upon whether that application was properly completed. \r\nProvided the application is approved, the applying household will then receive a letter containing a specific exemption certificate number or ECN. \r\nThis number then has to be properly inserted on to a form 8965 and filed with the IRS in order for the tax filer to claim the marketplace exemption. \r\nLet me just state the obvious. This whole process is going to be confusing and frustrating for many tax filers. \r\nOrdinarily, clients who come in to our offices without an ECN in hand, would be looking at what we call the file now and amend later approach. \r\nHowever, there is some good late-breaking news, that the IRS will permit filers without an ECN in hand to claim their full refund using a pending code on Form 8965. This would avoid the inconvenience and expense of needing to come back and amend the tax return in order to claim the penalty exemption.\r\nHowever, the paper application would still need to be mailed to HHS. Given the complexity of the entire process -- exemption process, and the fact that few tax filers are even where they may qualify, we believe that helping our clients find and properly claim penalty exemptions is one of our biggest value-added opportunities for this coming tax season. In many cases, the value created by finding an exemption can exceed the entire cost of the tax return.\r\nThe sixth and final impact concerns new ACA-driven form filing requirements. The most prevalent change is that the 1040 easy-based form cannot be used for those filers who need to reconcile their premium tax credits. These filers will instead need to bump-up to a more complicated 1040 or 1040A. The good news is that while the easy cannot be used in conjunction with the premium tax credit, it can be used in situations where the filer is just verifying coverage, paying a penalty or claiming an exemption. \r\nFinally, I want to leave you with one last thought around ACA tax impacts. While discussing these impacts, you might have gotten the impression that each impacted household would face one of these tax consequences. Ah! If it was only that simple. On the contrary, we expect many tax filers will experience multiple simultaneous ACA tax impacts. How can that be? Well, you might, for instance have a household then enrolled in a plan via marketplace in January and then dropped coverage in July, or you might have some uninsured family members that qualify for exemptions and some that do not. As a result there can be many combinations of ACA forms and worksheets that may be needed.\r\nUnderstandably, your heads may be spinning at this point. So let's take a deep breath and summarize these key headlines. \r\nFirst, virtually all of the 8 million-or-so who enrolled in the health plan via federal or state-based marketplace will receive a new 1095-A tax doc this year. Next, every tax filer will be asked about their household coverage status with those that are covered with either an employer or government plan needing only to attest using a check-box. Anyone who received premium tax credits, when they enrolled on the marketplace, must file and when they file, they need to reconcile the credit using form 8962. \r\nUninsured households will face either a tax penalty or if they qualify, they will need to file for an exemption using form 8965, and ultimately, we believe, many families will confront multiple ACA tax impacts.\r\nWhat we have talked a lot about forms, check-boxes calculations, and formulas, there is another important dimension around these ACA tax impacts. \r\nI'm speaking to the confusion, frustration, and a range of emotions that consumers will experience this coming tax season as they confront this new law. \r\nWe felt the best way to convey this would be to walk you through a few real-life scenarios through the eyes of our clients that will illustrate the typical range of ACA situations that are likely to occur either at the tax desk or in front of the computer. \r\nLet's start with Dan and Lucy Green. Dan works as a retail store Manager for a small employer that doesn't provide health insurance. Dan and Lucy filed using a 1040EZ in 2013. When they heard about the new marketplaces, they were excited to be able to get affordable insurance, especially because Lucy is pregnant with their first child. When they enrolled on the federal marketplace, Dan was the sole earner in the household, and he estimated their household income for 2014 to be $38,000, because that's his annual salary. On that basis, the Green's qualified for advance premium tax credits that reduced the cost of their monthly insurance premiums. Now, let's fast-forward to January 2015, when the Green's receive in the mail a 1095-A document from the marketplace that indicates they received advanced tax credit payments of about $2,700. When the Green's get their taxes prepared, they learn that because they received advance premium tax credits, they will now need to reconcile the credit based on their actual household income for 2014. And because they received a tax credit, they also learned that they can no longer use the 1040EZ form and must now use a more complex 1040. Because the Green's year end household income, however, ends up being higher due to Lucy getting a part-time job, their reconciliation results in actually a $1,200 repayment to the government, which will be now be taken out of their tax refund. This was a refund that they were planning to use to buy a much-needed used car for Lucy. Both Dan and Lucy are surprised and frustrated because they now have to put that purchase on hold.\r\nNow, let's talk about Clyde and Vicki Mason. Clyde's an independent contractor and is currently uninsured. However, his spouse Vicki is covered under her employer's plan. Together the Mason's household income is about $65,000. Even though Clyde heard about the individual mandate, he does not believe the government will enforce it; and if they do, it's only going to cost him $95. When the Mason's come in to get their taxes prepared, they learn that because Clyde was uninsured for 2014, and he does not qualify for any exemptions, he will have to pay a shared responsibility payment to the government. Clyde's surprised, he will have to pay, but even more surprised when he learns that the tax penalty will be almost $450. \r\nClyde had never heard about the percentage of income method of calculating the penalty. The Mason's also learned that next year, if Clyde continues to be uninsured, their tax penalty will double to $900. As a result, Clyde is rethinking his plans for future insurance coverage. \r\nHere's our last case study. Michael and Tina Alvarez have a household income of about $23,000. Michael and Tina have 2 children and live in Texas, which is a non-expansion Medicaid state. Tina's mother lives with them as well, but does not have valid immigration documentation. Both parents and Tina's mom are uninsured, but their 2 children received coverage assistance from the government's Children Health Insurance Program or CHIP. When the Alvarez's family comes in for their taxes, their tax pro indicates that because both of them and Tina's mother were uninsured for 2014. They could face a $285 tax penalty, which scares them because they frankly need every penny of their refund to pay needed household expenses. However, after some digging, their tax professional indicates that they will qualify to receive a penalty exemption right at the tax desk due to their low income level, and because Tina's mom is not subject to ACA tax penalties.\r\nAs we walk through these scenarios, hopefully you saw some common themes play out: Confusion and strong emotions, especially frustration, born of lack of awareness or misperceptions. Increased tax complexity with new tax form filing requirements, surprise refund impacts for those filers who count on the refund each year for critical household expenses and the reality that while calculating the tax penalty is painful, finding an exemption represents a true value-added hero opportunity for the tax professional. Hopefully, it's now evident that for millions of filers this coming tax season, it's going to be whole new ballgame. And it's a new ballgame for H&R Block too. And addressing these new ACA tax impacts has required us to make some key investments in our core operating and client support model. Let's cover these in a little bit more detail. \r\nThese ACA-related investments fall into 5 categories: Training and support, Blockworks and DIY tax software, our GoHealth partnership, operations and support, and finally marketing programs. With ACA, we are looking at the biggest change to the federal tax code in decades. Fully preparing our tax professionals to effectively navigate the new ACA tax provisions is of paramount importance. Plain and simple, we are committed to making sure our tax pros have access to the most comprehensive ACA training in the industry. \r\nIn fact, all told, our tax professionals will received over 600,000 hours of ACA-specific training prior to tax season, including tax theory, client experience, and extensive case study work designed to prepare our tax pros to confidently handle the full range of situations they are likely to face and then some.\r\nAdditionally, we created a multilayered network of support tools and resources to ensure our tax professionals are kept up-to-date on new developments and get quick answers to their questions, especially around deeply complex areas of this law.\r\nEarlier, Bill introduced you to Blockworks, our new private cloud-based tax office software. Blockworks will also play a critical role guiding our tax professionals through all possible the ACA client situations. With Blockworks, our tax professionals will have access to a state-of-the-art tool with built-in guardrails and navigation designed to identify the optimal path for each and every client. \r\nIn addition to our office tax software, we also have enhanced our do-it-yourself text products to address the full range of ACA forms including reconciliation, penalties and exemptions as well as including the best help in the industry for user questions that may emerge during the tax interview. \r\nWhile H&R Block has enormous expertise around taxes, we don't have a lot of experience or expertise around health insurance. That's why we partnered with GoHealth. GoHealth is a privately held health insurance services software and outsourcing company with extensive experience with developing and managing consumer-based insurance exchange platforms. They have deep relationships with 200-plus insurance carriers and have full -- fully integrated call center capabilities, including agents licensed to sell throughout the United States. From a business standpoint, we split commissions with GoHealth for any enrolled client. \r\nACA will also impact our day-to-day retail operations. Clients who are directly impacted by ACA will likely take more tax preparation time, as well as frequent reminders to bring in the proper documentation.\r\nFor clients setting appointments this year, we're going to be asking them a few new questions upfront to determine if they are impacted and if so, we will be automatically adjusting their appointment times. We also plan to closely monitor key performance metrics and operational issues tied to ACA such as average wait times and tax returns that are on hold, waiting for the client to bring in the needed documentation.\r\nFinally, given the overall consumer confusion and angst around the tax impacts of the Affordable Care Act, we intend to aggressively promote our brand and our powerful ACA value proposition to America. Our plans include employing a wide array of marketing elements and media at national scale, including advertising, direct mail, search, office signage, digital assets, local marketing and PR events. In other words, we are not holding anything back when it comes to ACA as we believe now, more than ever, consumers will be looking for tax expertise that they can trust. \r\nNow let's talk about enrollment support. Compared to last year, thankfully, healthcare.gov and the state base marketplaces have operated much more smoothly. Nevertheless, the enrollment process continues to be daunting for many eligible households, especially with respect to finding, comparing and enrolling in the right health plan, with the right doctors and hospitals, with the right deductible level and the right prescription drug formulary. That is why we are continuing to offer enrollment assistance via our partnership with GoHealth.\r\nOpen enrollment began November 15. But compared to last year, the sign-up window is about half as long, lasting only until February 15. Besides the shorter time period, there's another issue with the February 15 end date. As practically, there will be many later filers who won't find out they are facing large penalties until later in the tax season. And as it now stands, they won't be able to enroll in a health plan unless they meet special enrollment qualifications. That is why we have formally requested that HHS consider extending the open-enrollment period for those facing penalties through the end of the tax season.\r\nAnd just as we did last year, during open enrollment, we will continue to provide free remote assistance by phone or online from licensed insurance agents who will walk clients step-by-step through the government application, help them with health plan selection and comparisons, officially enroll them in a plan and in some cases, even collect the first month's premium payment. \r\nI'm going to conclude by talking about the opportunity thesis for H&R Block. I stated at the outset that we believe this new intersection between ACA and taxes will create growth opportunities for H&R Block across multiple areas and over time. One of the immediate and direct opportunities ties to added tax form complexity for ACA-impacted filers and even more explicitly \r\n[Audio Gap] \r\nfocused on creating added tangible value via our are retail experience and our tax expertise. Practically, this means addressing client questions and concerns, finding tax penalty exemptions, helping them enroll in health plans and providing each client with information around ACA -- how ACA could impact them now and in the future. \r\nBy virtue of increased tax complexity and the overall confusion for a large swath of tax filers, we think the opportunities presented by the Affordable Care Act are significant. Including the opportunity to drive new client growth, whether that be from other tax preparers or DIY consumers who may be facing a more complicated tax interview that impacts their tax refund. We also see the potential to drive loyalty and retention and referrals by helping each of our clients understand if and how the Affordable Care Act impacts them in plain English. Combined with the immediate benefits of identifying valuable exemptions.\r\nAnd finally, we believe our enrollment assistance services extends our brand into new relevant consumer pinpoints that can provide block with additional revenue growth opportunities. \r\nIn closing, while many of you are focused on the impact of ACA and the upcoming tax season, the truth is that large-scale impacts of this law will unfold over time, and key interim changes could substantially alter the outcome. Likely coming in June will be the Supreme Court ruling, but there are other impacts that we need to keep an eye on as well, including increases in marketplace enrollments both this fall and next year, which will drive reconciliation activity. New coverage documentation requirements for all tax filers, the doubling of the tax penalties due to noncoverage and impact of the employer mandate both on businesses and employees.\r\nWe believe that H&R Block is set up to win with ACA. Because of our unrivaled brand strength, we will be the go-to-trusted source for all things ACA, because of our deep tax expertise and our industry-leading knowledge, training and support, because of our large pool of tax professionals operating out of an expansive national network of over 10,000 offices, because of our unique ability to serve a wide range of consumers across multiple channels and methods. And finally, because of our commitment to invest where and when we need to in training, technology, client service and marketing to serve clients better than any in the industry.\r\nThanks for hanging in there with me today and for your time.\r\n[Video Presentation]\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nSo I've watched Mark do that presentation several times and I have to tell you, I learn something new every time and it continues to amaze me. The complexity that this country's going to be going through in the near term.\r\nThe other thing I should point out before I begin my presentation is, I think this is the first time that all of you come to our Investor Meeting, we're actually giving you tax forms to take with you. So you can thank us later for that. \r\nAnyway, I'm Greg Macfarlane. I'm really here to take my time with you to wrap up everything together from what you've heard today. We've gone through a lot of material with you, but we do have an organization and a theme to it that I'll share with you. Before I do that, though, I do want to talk about our second quarter results that we released last evening. A lot of you had the chance to read that. \r\nSo with that, I'll start here with revenue. So revenues for the first quarter were $135 million. They were up slightly from the prior year. We had higher tax prep fees during the off-season in United States and Australia. Where in Australia, we actually just completed our 44th tax season and delivered another strong year, so congratulations to our Australia team. We also continue to improve our off-season usage of the Emerald Card, building on a Tax Plus momentum that you heard Bill talk about extensively earlier today. \r\nNext, adjusted pretax loss from continuing operations was $202 million, which was an increase of $19 million compared to the prior year. This increase in revenue was offset by an increase in operating expenses. This was primarily due to higher depreciation, amortization from acquisitions and planned office and technology upgrades. \r\nAdditionally, compensation and benefits were higher driven by the investments in people, Bill spoke to earlier today. A common theme you've heard throughout today's presentation is that we're investing back into our business. To capitalize on the opportunities that we've discussed earlier, we're investing in our technology, our people, our offices and our -- into Tax Plus. For the same reasons you're all attracted to the stock, we think these are good investments, which will drive significant return on investment. I'll speak to more about that later. \r\nOn an EPS basis, our seasonal adjusted net loss from continuing operations was $0.45 per share or $0.03 higher than the prior year. While our losses are trending modestly higher year-to-date, in a business as seasonal as ours, it's difficult to read too much into the off-season results. As many of you know, tax season performance during the fourth quarter represents a substantial majority of revenues and earnings for the year. \r\nSo with that, let me turn to discontinued operations. This includes the results of Sand Canyon. Here, our second quarter net income of $1 million compared to a loss of $2 million in the prior year. Sand Canyon remains engaged in bulk discussions with the counter parties from which it had received a significant majority of asserted claims. Just last week, Sand Canyon entered into a settlement agreement to resolve certain of those claims. Due to the timing and accounting rules around this, you will see a disclosure in our second quarter 10-Q later this week, but the actual accounting itself will not be included until the third quarter 10-Q. Importantly, the payment amount under the settlement agreement was fully included in the liability recorded at October 31, 2014, of $194 million. This represents progress for Sand Canyon and though there is still work ahead and it may take some time, Sand Canyon continues to make important stride to wind down its efforts. \r\nWith that, I now want to turn and talk more broadly about H&R Block. When I talk about H&R Block, for me, there are really 3 things that come to mind: First was we represent great growth opportunity for investors; second, we do that in a value environment; and third, we are consider to be a low-risk environment. Throughout today's presentation, you've heard a number of examples of those, but in summary, this is how we think about the growth opportunities. It's nice to work in an industry where you show up and every year, there's 1% to 2% more returns. This gets combined with the fact that in our industry, we have real pricing power and we know how to use it. \r\nIn terms of the favorable macro conditions, the economy continues to get stronger, homeownership percentages continue to get better and this is a nice tailwind for this company. Health care reform, after that presentation by Mark, you are now more understanding of health care reform in the United States than 99% of the people. If you don't understand the opportunities that present itself, then we need to do the presentation over for you. \r\nFourth is our Tax Plus. This has been a major part of our focus in the last several years, and we've seen good progress here. Importantly, building our successes upon last year, we move up from 20% to 24% attach rate. The continued progress in Emerald Card, we're introducing a new product to the market this year, the Taxes Identity Shield, which we're very excited about. \r\nJason Houseworth, early today, talked about our digital strategy in great amount of detail. Block is well positioned here. We invest real capital into this business. In fact, we overinvest in this area because we believe as this continued -- this industry continues to evolve that Block will naturally benefit.\r\nAnd lastly, as international growth. It represents a little bit less than 10% of our overall revenues but actually, it's growing at a greater rate from the rest of the company, and we expect that trend to continue. \r\nOn the value side, this company is a very profitable one. We generate a lot of cash here. So the #1 metric that we worry about is our ability to generate cash from this system. Importantly and increasingly, we're going to be talking about that as an efficient user of capital. Return on invested capital, ROE, is an important metric for us, and we generate a high level of return on the cash that we have. \r\nNext is our dividend track record and repurchased track record. We pay a healthy dividend. We've been paying a healthy dividend for more than 50 years. We also have a good track record of buying back shares smartly. As you all know, we've been in a period here for a couple of years where we've not been able to increase our dividend and/or buy back shares. \r\nIn terms of the low risk, we do have this mortgage issue that we're dealing with. I just shared an update with you on Sand Canyon's progress there. My perspective -- our perspective is this is a time-bounded issue. It will take time to resolve itself. But with this latest announcement, it's a good example of that forward progress that we are expecting. \r\nAnd lastly, but probably most importantly, is really stable management. For many of you investors and people that know this company, as friends of ours, that have been coming to these things for many years, I think it's a good sign when you see many -- the same members of management here in the stage with a consistent view year-to-year on our strategy and our execution. \r\nIn a business model that executes only one time a year for most of our clients, it is important to have a view of the medium and long term.\r\nSo with that, I wanted to go into a bit more detail with you. This is a tax industry view back to 1952, and what I'm showing you here is the number of returns get filed here in the United States. The same graph, by the way, is the same in Canada and Australia. Obviously, the x-axis would be different. There is a 97% R-squared correlation to nonfarm employment. This is an employment-driven industry. And it's nice to be in a business that despite recession and wars and economic cycles is pretty resilient at 1% to 2% growth. I mentioned just in the last page, this concept around pricing power. We measure pricing power in the assistive side at 0.1. What that means is for a 1% change in price, we would expect only a 10 basis point impact on volume. This is one of the realities of our business model and something that Block has invested a lot of effort into. It is a strategic opportunity for us to take that 1% to 2% base level volume growth and be able to grow on top of that. \r\nThis is a graph that shows you how people like to get their taxes done. We've shown this to you before, there's nothing new here. 60% of Americans like to get someone to help with their taxes, and 40% like to do it themselves. The emotions that drive that are listed on the right-hand side. These are very pervasive. This is a very big deal for people. It is a very clear categorization how people think about taxes. The only thing that has really changed, by the way, is in the DIY space. And I think Jason did an exceptionally good job of actually walking back through the history of this industry to show that when it started, all pen and paper to what it is today, is almost the exact same number. What has changed is those individuals that used to go to the post office, pick up the tax forms, kitchen table, shoebox, pencil and did their taxes. Those people have chosen to outsource their calculations to software, okay, initially, done through the DIY desktop, which was software in a box, but increasingly as Internet is more pervasive and people more comfortable with the cloud through SaaS based offerings, which is the online. The ability for that industry to grow is slowing down quickly as the remaining amount of pen and paper people are almost nonexistent. The only changes that we've seen in the last few years is the number of people doing DIY are driven by fraud. If it wasn't for the issue around fraud, specifically, the EIC migration, based on the unlevel playing field between assisted and DIY, the DIY industry would have actually shrunk. \r\nThe overall industry we operate in is a very big one at $19 billion. The vast majority of revenues here actually go through the assistance side. You've seen that from us several times, only 10% go through the DIY space. If you look at it by competitor, though, the map changes a lot. Although Block is the largest competitor in the space, we only have 15% of the share. All the other branded competitors, which include both assisted and software are a little bit less than we are in total. Our biggest opportunity, as time goes on, is to continue to address the issue that we see in the appended side. They  represent 44% of the market. And Sean did a really nice job talking to you at a very practical level about how we see that industry unfolding, the issues within that and the opportunities that we see in the short-term and, of course, in the long term, as we believe, standards will go up. \r\nBlock knows taxes better than anybody. Not only did we invent this industry, but we have been the source of every major innovation this industry has seen from day one. This is an industry, as you think about it playing over the next 10 years, you have to think about how each competitor's going to shake out of this conversation, and we believe that Block is the best position. \r\nOne of the reasons we say that is that we have a brand that's unmatched in the space. We have a brand awareness of 98%, which is on par with major well-known consumer brands across the country. This is a direct result of billions of dollars of investment in marketing over decades. It is the direct result of us doing hundreds of millions of people's taxes successfully over decades. If you want to compete in the tax-preparation space, you have to automatically understand how you're going to differentiate versus Block because we are the name in taxes. \r\nNext is our reach. As all of you know here in the U.S., we have about 10,400 locations, roughly 40% franchise run and 60% are company run. That number is not going to change a lot. What we have been through in the most recent years is a specific downsizing effort with our investment into Sears and Walmart. We're finished with that now. And if you went back before that, there was a period, which Block expanded very quickly our footprint, which was a mistake. We're past that now. As we look forward, we expect to grow our footprint modestly year in and year out, which will be a source of growth for us. This is based off of our understanding of our customers, our data models and our ability to execute an operational model that understands that with $40,000 or $60,000 to open up a new store, we know how to make that run successfully. The population shifting in the United States, the competitive environment continues to shift, and we have identified pockets of opportunity that will lead to some consistent growth over the next few years. \r\nOur tax professionals. This is, by the way, from my perspective, being with Block for 2.5 years as the most amazing part of this model. For our client that comes into our offices and sits down to do their work with us, H&R Block is the tax professional across the desk from them. The vast majority of those individuals are seasonal employees. This is Richard Gartland, he's the face of H&R Block. He's not just another pretty face. He's actually a tax professional. Works for us in Glendale, California. I don't know if you know this, but he actually does a couple of hundred returns per year. In fact, all the requirements we've been putting on him the last couple of years in terms of our shooting and ads and TV appearances and stuff is actually getting in his way of serving his clients, which he is, by the way, pretty upset about. We hire, train, develop, supervise, place, compensate and execute tens of thousands of seasonal people in a very fast time period. It's this time of the year that we're actually in the middle of it, and me who gets to sit on the side lines to see an organization that goes from coast-to-coast to find these people and ramp them, it was really amazing. This is the biggest barrier for any competitor in the space, to find and be able to place seasonal tax professionals that execute with quality, and Block does it better than anybody. \r\nRetentions another nice benefit about being in this industry, simply because most Americans, including yourselves, will likely only change the way they do their taxes 3 or 4 times in their lifetime. The main reason that someone changes the way they do their taxes is because of a change in a life event. You moved, you bought a home, you retired, you had a child, you got divorced. These are triggers in which you may want to reassess how you get your taxes done. But putting that aside, the average tax preparer knows, with some degree of certainty, 60% of their clients are going to come back next year, which is not a bad business to be in. As you can see here, Block actually does 70%, which is a full 10 points higher than our other branded competitors. This is a direct result of all the investment we make in our people, and our brand and how we execute with service. It's something that we are very proud of. \r\nIn the DIY space, we are investing a lot of money here. You saw a lot of the specific examples of that today as our journey continues here. We are going to continue to overinvest in this area because we believe that Block is a very good alternative for many Americans to do their taxes. As a reminder, we are the only company that actually says we just want to be here when you do your taxes. We're agnostic to how you want to do your taxes. Now me, as a CFO, of course, there's an economic difference between the two. But we're in this for a lifetime, and we think it's important to have a solution that starts in the DIY and goes all the way over to assisted and all the spaces within -- between them. We believe that in the next few years, that competitive environment you see in the circle of chart on the right-hand side is going to change, and you're going to have to think yourselves who will be the winners and who will be the losers. We obviously think that Block will be one of the winners.\r\nOne of the main things happening in this industry is this introduction of pricing. So for the first time last season, we saw the main competitor in the industry turned to pricing as a competitive differentiator, and we believe that has short-term and long-term implications for this industry. Historically, within the segment, there has been of value subsegment and a premium subsegment. That is now going to collide, and we think turn into 1 segment. Okay, Block is well positioned for that.  On the higher end, these are the people that have the more sophisticated returns that typically pay more for their software. What we see from the industry leaders, they are putting the price up fairly materially in certain areas to be able to afford dropping the price in the low end. We also think that Block will benefit, not just to our DIY potentially, but even some of our assisted clients -- assisted maybe more of an alternative percent of DIY clients. \r\nNext is international. So I reported earlier on Australia, so I'm not going to touch on that too much. In Canada, we're about to start the same tax season. Roughly in Canada, as we do in the United States, and we've been seeing good growth from that team. The main focus for Canada in the medium and long term is really to become a presence in the DIY space within Canada. You probably don't know this, but Canada has been, for Block, about 1% market share in the DIY side, with the main competitor in the U.S. being the largest provider in Canada, too. That's over -- so Block is now entering the software DIY space in Canada and it's a medium- and long-term investment for us. \r\nThere's other opportunities that we presented here, both in Brazil, India and expat. And for us, these are smart, long-term investments. As I said before, the best time to plant an oak tree was 100 years ago or today. We've been in Brazil and India now for several years. We continue to invest money there because we think there's long-term investment or long-term return. The amounts of money that we're talking about, however, fairly modest and measured in a few million dollars per year. But those Economies are changing quickly, and we think that Block has a long term solution that will help its citizens and the government navigate an increasingly complicated tax system. \r\nTax Plus is a very important part of our overall strategy and really starts with the foundational nature of our relationship with our client. Most of our clients will come in to our office and spend up to an hour with a tax professional sharing with them intimate financial information about their life. It is a trusted relationship. 85% of our clients walk out with a big smile on their face because they're getting a refund. And we have learned over the years that if you have the right financial products, you can add value to the client's life and make some money at the same time. We've had good success in the last few years as we focused on Emerald Card and Peace of Mind, in particular, but never forget that Emerald advance and refund transfer are very important ways that we add value to our clients' lives. We're happier for this year, we have a new thing we can add value to their lives on, which is the Tax Identity Shield. This is an important product that's dealing within a very specific issue. Last year, as you saw from our chart in Bill's section, there were over 3 million individuals whose identities were stolen and someone else filed their tax return on their behalf. This is a problem, and we have a solution. \r\nNext, specifically, is the Emerald Card. And I've always believed and I think, as you heard from Bill, that this is really the crown jewel within the Tax Plus suite of products. The #1 reason I believe that is because there's been the fundamental shift really since the 2008 crisis and how Americans need to get financial services. Many banks are looking at their client base and saying that we can no longer make money on these individuals, we're restricted on the fees we can charge them and they're pushing them out of the mainstream system.\r\nBlock's clients, about half of them in total, are considered either under-banked or not banked at all. And yet, these are individuals that still need to have access to buy airplane tickets and paying utilities and living their lives. And that's why this debit card product has been such an explosion in the last several years and Block has the third largest program out there: NetSpend and Green Dot are 1 and 2 here. We've worked really hard to improve the features and functions of this product to make it appeal to clients so that they can use that as their year-round card, and we have had some good success here. As you can see in the bottom right here, we've moved our revenue per card 2 years ago from $36 a card per year to last year at $44. That's almost a $10 increase in 2 years, and we expect that trend to continue. We don't know if we'll ever get up to entitlement. So if you look in the table above that, the revenue per account that a Green Dot or NetSpend gets, which is in the low 100s. It's unlikely we'll get into low 100s, but I think it's very realistic to expect $50 or $60 or plus dollars as we continue to develop this product. \r\nSo next, I want to talk about the bank. I know that Bill talked about this right upfront, but I want to make a few things clear to you. One, we are going to exit the banking system. We're focused on getting it done. We believe, second of all, that the transaction we presented to the OCC, with our partners at BofI, is a good transaction and its merits will be approved. We have to be patient. The point at which we have more information, as we have done to date, we'll get on the phone and have a conversation with you. We cannot predict what the regulatory time line is because that's not the way it works. \r\nThe ACA and the tax care -- and the taxes in the United States are intersection point this year, and so I actually think the graphic here is perfect because we're standing right now in the middle of that. Up until this past year, ACA has been a notion. It's been an idea. It's been a concept for most people. But for the first time when someone sits down to do their taxes this year, will be when they have to sit down and face into the realities of their situation that relates to health care, and this situation will only get more complicated as the next few years unravel. People will have new documents, they're going to have more questions, they're going to have more forms to fill in and this is a great opportunity for H&R Block to demonstrate the value that we bring. We are investing real money in this area. You've heard a number of examples from Mark, but as a CFO, I'll tell you that this costs real money. And the reason we're saying investment is very specifically, this is not an expense for us. This is something that we believe will have short term, medium term and long term return for us. As you've known, for those of you who followed us last few years, we've also invested money last year and the year before, and we thought that was a good investment then and we think it's a good investment now.\r\nWhen this investment pays off, what we think about will translate are these following factors: New client growth. Based on the description you heard from Mark, do you think it's likely that people who go to other assisted-tax preparers, especially a lot of the ones that you saw from Sean in those pictures, are not going to be satisfied with the level of understanding that tax professional may have? The fact that their return changed a lot? We think some of those people are going to come talk to us. We think a number of people who are going to sit in front of their computers, because that's what they are normally used to doing and are normally used to handling their taxes and change in the tax law that way. For the first time, they say, \"My return were changed in a more amount -- larger amount than I ever expected to do, and I don't understand why. Because for me, I was counting on that money. So maybe, for the first time, I'm going to talk to somebody about that.\" And we want Block to be well positioned for that. Of course, there's a third pool of people, which are those who have not been regular filers who are now, because of the rules of the healthcare reform, required to file. For what it's worth, we don't think there's a lot of those individuals, but there are some individuals that will fall under that category. All the investments that we're making in all the different areas I just talked about in the previous page will have benefits. We think our current clients will see that and will become more loyal. We think as we attract new clients who maybe sampling us just for 1 or 2 years may see the value of H&R Block. And so we think that over time, they will also be loyalty retention benefits. \r\nWe are a value-based pricing system, which you can also think of as a form-based pricing system. We showed you a number of new forms, we will be charging for them this season. We will not be telling you how much that is because the reality is, a lot of the competitors are listening to this call right now, want to know what we're charging in and they'll take their position off of that, okay? There is pricing opportunity here for us for sure. \r\nAnd lastly is enrollment services. A number of people are very confused by the complexity of selecting health care. If you've ever had a chance to go on and look at  the health care sites, you'll only knew about 5 minutes to realize. This is a very daunting thing for many people. Should I go with the silver level? Should I go with the bronze level? What did they spend last year? What am I may going to spend this year? What's my co-pay amount going to be? I don't understand why there's so many options here. We think that Block is a trusted source and we've validated that through our research. Our ability introduced clients to -- as additional value add as a way for us to help them and, of course, make money and this is the partnership with GoHealth that we're very positive about. GoHealth has been a good partner, and we expect to have a lot of opportunities as we look forward. \r\nSo with that, let me switch more to the financial overview of the company and really start with some of the basics. This is just a graph that goes back to 1996. What you're seeing here is our pretax earnings. Generally, a good story, I mean, especially in the last few years, as we continue to work on this. Last year, we increased our pretax segment earnings from 2012 to '14 by $162 million. It's a good story. Our EBITDA margin, which is something I get a lot of questions on, I thought I'd addressed that, but everyone kind of knows we did last year, we reported 31% EBITDA margins, which was up from the year before and dramatically up from the year before. So as you can see from 2012 to 2014, we've increased EBITDA margin by 5 full points to 31%. If you actually take that number and compare it to the S&P 500, or we've also shown here the consumers index, we say we have envious margins for a reason. So these are the average S&P EBITDA margins, which are reported at, typically, in the high teens, 19% or so. Not a bad business to be in.\r\nThe other thing that I talked about is an expected range of margin with you. And up until this past year, I've talked about a range of 27% to 32% as a range. We've done a lot of work on that and unfortunately or fortunately out of that, there's been a minor change to that model. We're now going to say 28% to 32%, for what it's worth. \r\nThis page shows free cash flow and so the -- I'm sorry, the total graph actually shows operating cash in total and from that, you have CapEx. As you all know, we've been spending a little bit more in CapEx. Our normal expected range in CapEx is 2% to 3% of revenues. That's ticked up specifically, and I'll address that here in a page. Once we get past CapEx, of course, we have a dividend that we're very proud of paying. We take that out. But even then, we still have a lot of free cash flow. Free cash flow is a very important metric for Block and one that Bill and the management team are very focused on. \r\nNext, I want to talk, actually, specifically, about our CapEx investment. We do, as I said, expect CapEx historically to be about 2% to 3% of revenues, which reflects a mature business model that also is a service-based model, whose main investments typically are furniture and computers and software, but nothing in a material sense like many other industries. We do expect CapEx, again, this year to be about 5% of revenues. But having said that, and I'll talk about this at the end to confirm it, we expect that the tick back down to a normal range. \r\nNow at some point, as you all know, there's a difference between the way the cash gets spent and the way it gets accounted for. And so the other line shows you depreciation and amortization. And I want to be clear that we expect a big step up in depreciation and amortization this year. Last year was $160 [ph] million. This year, we're expecting at $165 million.\r\nIn addition to the elevated levels of CapEx in the last few years, there are 2 other reasons why that's going up. Secondly, is the fact the nature of the assets that we're buying have a shorter lifespan. And so as you can expect, the amortization, depreciation tables are a little bit more accelerated. The third, and actually probably larger driver than the second one, is the fact we've been actually buying back a number of our franchisees is here in the last year. In fact, this year, by the time it's finished, we'll expect to have invested over $100 million in buying back former company territories that we refranchised and are now buying back. We believe that's a good solid investment, but it has a depreciation and amortization impact on the short term. \r\nI mentioned this earlier and it's a topic that you'll be hearing from us increasingly as time goes on, which is return on invested capital. We think it's a better metric, but it's very similar to, obviously, ROE here. And we've shown you back to 2009, per year, what our ROIC is, so last year, reported 25% return on invested capital. By the way, this is with the well-capitalized bank and, the fact, we've been building up capital, okay? It's a number that we're focused on. When you make that -- and you continue the story and really talk about what's the inherent cost of capital and, of course, we do this math on a regular basis, it's one of the things I get paid to do is worry about how to optimize our cost of capital, you can see us, we're typically right around 9%. This is a very good investment return for people, and something that we're very focused on. \r\nAnd another thing I wanted to do on ROIC is provide some context for you here. So this slide actually shows you Block, we're in a green bubble. So 2013, and we have to do this on calendar year not fiscal years, 25%. The red circle represents the average ROIC for the S&P 500 and the bar -- the top of the bar is the 75th percentile and the bottom bar is the 25th percentile. So we actually will now talk about our speed [ph] having enviable ROIC margins and this is the basis for that conclusion. This is a good investment. It's a good, efficient generator of -- use of capital to generate the returns that we do. \r\nNext is dividends. As you all know in the last 2 years, we have actually been prohibited increasing our dividend. Right now, we pay $0.80 per share per year, which represents based on today's shift share price, roughly 2.3% yield. Historically, we've always been higher than the S&P 500, which I don't think is a bad thing for a mature company that generates this level of cash flow. At the point at which we exit the bank will be a chance for us to reexamine our dividend policy. \r\nNext, which is a little bit of the building on the concept of dividends is also the concept to share repurchases. For the same reasons, we've been prohibited from increasing the dividend. We've also been prohibited from buying back shares really for the last 2 years. If you put that aside though and really look since 2012, between dividends and share repurchases, we've actually returned to you $1.2 billion, which for a company that has a market capitalization of $9 billion is not a bad number. The other thing I like about this chart is we've indicated in the bottom line the average price we bought those shares back. So if you look back in those 2 last windows in '12 and '13 when we were buying back shares, we typically bought them back about $14 or so. Given the share price right now sits in the low 30s, mid-30 range, that wasn't a bad investment. Importantly at the point in the future where we may have the ability to buy back shares, we will always look to intrinsic values as a guideline about efficient capital and ways of optimizing value for you.\r\nThe broader concept of capital allocation is a simple model. I've shared this with you before, but just to reiterate, Job 1 for us is to make sure we pay the bills. This is a very profitable business, and we need to make sure that we continue to invest back into it. So step 1 is to making sure that we fund the operational liquidity needs of the tax business.\r\nOnce we get past that, we do think it's a smart investment to invest in the future. Today was a great example a number of those investments in real life. I want to be very clear with you though from a financial perspective. Many of these investments, in combination with the fact that we get to do business once per year with many of our clients, have multi years to pay back. They're smart investments, they have multiyear paybacks, but they do cost money in the short term. Once we get past the strategic initiatives, we, of course, then support our dividend. Our dividend payout ratio is approximately 45%. After that, we've always had cash left over. We have historically -- traditionally bought back shares, but obviously -- but the other thing is at this point with the bank, it really is a moot point from what we would do at this point. Job one for us, really from a capital perspective, is to effectively close this bank transaction and then we can talk about what level 4 will be. \r\nAnother idea that I get a lot of questions on so I thought we put a slide in today is really just talk about how we align value with you, our shareholders, with the management team you see here on the stage. We are a medium and long term based business model because of the nature of what we do, and we've tried to do -- work hard with the board to really understand what the right way to compensate is. On the left-hand side, you see the way that the CEO gets compensated and the right is myself and my colleagues. There's a bias here towards the long term and I think that's a good thing. \r\nNow in closing, I have 2 last slides for you, specifically, first is a market outlook and then the second one will be an H&R Block outlook. \r\nOn the market outlook, we do not know when the tax season will start this year. The IRS has not yet communicated that, but we do expect it to be late January, which is in line with the last 2 seasons. For many of you who follow tax season for a long time, the tax season has traditionally opened in the middle of January and it's really just been in the last 2 years that it shifted to be the end of January. We think that's likely to stay more permanent in nature. Why that matters for us is because our fiscal third quarter ends the end of January. So the implication of this is the majority of our transactions -- our economics and accounting will now be in the fourth quarter. \r\nThe next thing we want to talk about is what our expectations over the tax filing increase. It will be 1% to 2% in the industry this year, really based off of employment growth. However, within the 2 sub-segments, we think the assisted side will grow somewhere between zero to 1% and the digital side will be 4% to 5%. For the next few years, past this year, we continue to expect 1% to 2% overall. We think assisted will continue to be around 0% to 1%, but the digital will continue to moderate as the pen and paper filers continue to disappear. \r\nLast thing on this page is really about complexity, the complexity in tax law changes. This year is the heart of complexity when we deal with ACA that will, of course, unfold to the next few years. We also talk a lot about immigration reform and some other pieces of legislation. We also, by the way, have to worry about state levels, who increasingly or using the tax code as a way to generate additional income without actually increasing taxes. We think complexity is likely to continue, not simplify. How much, it's hard to tell. \r\nSo with that, let me turn more specifically to H&R Block here, and I'll kind of do this line by line with you because I know a number of you like this from a model perspective. So first, our compensation and benefits. A lot of the investments that we're making that you heard about today is really about people. We are increasing the number of people that are working for us and we're paying them more. You saw that a little bit here in the second quarter and that trend will continue. We expect this year for a dilution of roughly $0.04 a share. Once we get past this year, which is really the height of some of these investments, it will then moderate back to typical wage inflation, which would be 2% to 3% and we wouldn't really spec it out at that point in time. Secondly is training costs. As you heard from the ACA, but also this new system we're putting in, Blockworks, we're expecting and are seeing a big increase in our training budget, which, again, is an investment in our future. That specifically will be a dilution this year of about $0.05 per share that will moderate over the next few years to $0.02 to $0.03 of dilution. Those 2 things, in combination with a number of other things, which includes of course costs from productivity work that we're doing, will result in a drop of our EBITDA margin from last year of about 31%, we expect it to be about 30% this year. Just to be clear, the compensation and benefits and training costs I've outlined are included in that number. Once we get past this year, we continue to believe that EBITDA margin percentage will be somewhere between 28% to 32%. I want to be very clear on a major point here. Our objective is not to have EBITDA margin continue to grow by itself. Our goal is to get revenue to grow at a greater than 4% rate. And we're prepared to invest productivity back into getting that number to be more sustainable over time. That will then have natural margin expansion at that point in time. A lot of what we're doing is the cost we're taking out of the company, we are reinvesting back in the top line growth we think will pay back over the next few years. \r\nNext is CapEx. I talked about this earlier, but just to confirm, we expect this year to spend about 5% of revenues on CapEx, but that will go down here very shortly to 2% to -- 3% to 4% of revenues. And depreciation, to confirm the number for this year, we think somewhere between $160 million to $170 million. That number will stay elevated because of the 3 reasons I mentioned earlier all the way through fiscal year '19. This is one number that we see have several models a little bit out of sync on, so we want to be very explicit with you today on. \r\nNext is interest expense. Many of you know that we had a medium term note that was due here this October at a principal amount of $400 million. We chose to pay that down and that will result in interest savings for us this year. This ultimately, of course, gets wrapped up into what does our capital structure look like in a world where we don't have a bank. We don't have the answers to that right now. We felt, given the fact that we have an abundance of capital available to us, refinancing some debt just to say we're refinanced, it wasn't a smart thing for you, our shareholders, and that's why in the short term, we chose to pay down. It's not -- by any means, you shouldn't read that as a permanent change in our capital structure. Next is our tax rate. This year, we're expecting our tax rate to be somewhere between 35.5% to 36.5%. That is now going to be 3 years in a row where we've been in and around that range. Importantly, though, this year and the previous 2 years, that was really driven by a number of onetime events that we were able to structure and realized, which had good economic impact, it also allowed us to repatriate cash into the U.S. in a very smart way. Having said that, our long term objective is to focus on our base tax rate of 39% and bring that down. And we do have a number of things we're doing to bring that down. And at some point in the future, I'll talk to you more specifically about that. \r\nAnd then lastly, just to confirm, I think the obvious here, because of our inability to buy back shares, we expect the number of diluted shares outstanding to be about 278 million which is no real big change, and as we look out past this year, it's certainly to be contingent on the bank sale on the capital allocation. So hopefully, that helps from a more model perspective. But really just in closing, I think it's important to summarize what we talked about with you today. We think that Block represents a great growth opportunity, provides real value to you along the way, and generally, we think this is all done in a low-risk environment. Thank you, again, for braving the weather, spending your time with us this morning. We're going to take a very quick break, put some chairs up here and then open up for Q&A. So again, thank you.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: William Cobb (Executives)】\nSo we are set up here and we'll get started here in just 1 second. Just wanted to quickly remind everyone that the slides for today's presentations will be posted to our Investor Relations website later this afternoon and the transcript will be posted Monday. As we come around, so we will have microphones for all those of you who are asking questions. We just like for you to state your name, your company and then ask your question. We'll call on you at that time. \r\nOkay. So if you have a question, just raise your hand, we'll come around and get you. Scott?",
      "transcript_text3": "Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. I guess we'll start off with the news of last evening with regard to Sand Canyon. Greg, could you just elaborate a little bit more on that? I don't think it's fully understood what the development is that you reported last night. So any further color will be helpful.\n\n---\n\nYes, so it's an awkward time-line because it kind of happened after the end of the quarter, but before we released the quarterly report. But that doesn't really matter. What matters is obviously Sand Canyon's making forward progress on this issue. We are restricted in actually the specifics in which we can talk about, so unfortunately, I have to be a little bit vague. But specifically, there was a material development from a settlement with a counter party, that was involved from a [indiscernible] warrant claim, in our view in a positive way. I can't quantify that other than say it was a material amount of the reserve and the actual reserve in itself was fully contemplated in the reserves. There's no broader implication of the reserve amount.\n\n---\n\nAnd just to follow up. I'm not sure if you can answer this, but it represents past claimants and those who may still be pursuing. Should we infer that this would cover all as of this date who are putting forth claims, and therefore, could be a permanent solution? Or would there still be incremental opportunity for others once this agreement is concluded?\n\n---\n\nSo let me backtrack a little bit if that's okay. When we had shared this with you, which is probably 1.5 years ago the 6-year statute of limitations, which is what we believe is a matter of law has well expired at this point in time. So any new claimant that may show up at this point will have a very difficult time and the reality has been really no new claims to talk about. So really what this issue with Sand Canyon is focused on a limited number of counter parties that have a asserted claims that Sand Canyon felt was productive to enter into these towing [ph] arrangements, which was a way to stop the clock, and what we've announced yesterday was really one of those situations resolving.\n\n---\n\nThomas?\n\n---\n\nSo there's been a lot of chatter in the investment bank community about immigration reform and the potential benefits to you. You didn't touch much on it. Can we just get a little more -- couple of more thoughts on it?\n\n---\n\nSo couple of things on that. First of all, the President came out with that speech a couple of weeks ago. There's a lot of conversation about that whole area. So -- excuse me, we're still watching that to see what that is. What I wouldn't say is I think we're really well positioned here because we are the #1. \r\n[Audio Gap] \r\nWe are the leader in terms of the number of Latino returns that we do today. We have made a big step up over the last 2 years in terms of the number of bilingual tax pros we have. And I think similar to ACA, we had anticipated that something like this would come. I do think this will happen. I think it's to the benefit of, frankly, both parties, that something happen before 2016. But specific to the proposal that came out a couple of weeks ago, we're going to wait and see where that settles out. But we think, in general, this is going to be a net benefit to us.\n\n---\n\nIf you look at the details of their announcement, it's hard to understand how there'd be a direct benefit this tax season, specifically.\n\n---\n\nAnd then follow-up. So on the bank sale, I mean there's been some chatter that the increased scrutiny of prepaid debit cards by the CFPB, and maybe some other regulatory changes is what's slowing down the process. Can you answer that comment or those thoughts?\n\n---\n\nGreg, help me out if I don't phrase this right. I don't think it has any impact on the -- that's the CFPB and we're dealing with the OCC.\n\n---\n\nThe CFPB guidance just came out. Obviously, we looked at it in detail and the good thing about product is we are pretty much in full compliance right now. There's always been broader concerns, in general, about debit cards, but specific to our application, we think they're independent.\n\n---\n\nAll right.\n\n---\n\nAnd there's no increased scrutiny by -- on any of your other financial products, or you think any changes in regulatory frameworks that could have an impact?\n\n---\n\nI couldn't hear the questions.\n\n---\n\nJust in terms of changes in the regulatory process, on your other products and on Emerald Advance and Emerald One, and I guess, refund transfer. No changes in the environment that should be slowing down?\n\n---\n\nI mean these has been regulated for a number of years. We're operating the bank. Obviously, we're operating all those products. So no, I don't see any change to structure of our products or that this has any impact on the pending bank transaction.\n\n---\n\nAnd just to be clear, I mean, I completely agree with Bill. I mean, we don't think there's an issue. But we've said very clear, to the regulator -- if there is an issue, you need to tell us because and we'd be happy to change the product very quickly to accommodate that.\n\n---\n\nAnd the regulators have said anything to you?\n\n---\n\nThere's been no request to do anything.\n\n---\n\nAs a reminder, if you don't mind, state your name and your company before asking the question. That'd be helpful.\n\n---\n\n[indiscernible]. Could you discuss the decision-making factors and the relative economics between buying an independent, taking in a franchise and adding a new store, first? And then secondly, can we assume that following the '15 tax season, you will have commensurately more excess capital relative to the $850 million to $1 billion that you discussed previously?\n\n---\n\nSo Greg, why don't you -- I realize it's in Shawn's area, but I think this is more a financial question. So why don't you take that and Shawn, if there's anything you want to add at the end. Why don't you let Greg lead?\n\n---\n\nYes, I mean specifically the first part you've got, do we open a new store? Do we buy back -- or do we  buy an independent buy back a franchise? All 3 represent compelling financial returns from our perspective and one thing about us right now is we have an abundance of capital. So realistically, on the second of the -- on items 2 and 3, it's really -- well I should say really on the independents it's really a quality issue, so we work hard to find a limited number of deals because the quality is such a big issue for us, the franchise really is a onetime opportunity. This was a refranchise strategy the company pursued several years back. That was mistaken. We're fixing that and we're pretty much fixed at this point. So that's kind of close as an issue. In terms of opening up new stores, what we have learned from our history of opening up stores is slow and methodical is better than fast and hasty, because the operational structure, the quality tax professionals, the supervision of the district managers are very important. So we're going to be methodical and slow in that area, and as we continue to develop this as a muscle, we'll talk about maybe going a little bit faster.\n\n---\n\nBut if the company is within 5 miles of 85% of the population, is it fair to say that acquiring independents is a higher priority than opening new stores?\n\n---\n\nIt's going to be a combination of the two. And this is actually when Kathy did a really nice job of talking about how we're taking our data and understanding at a much level of greater detail with better analysis, and we're able to identify sides of the street corners, what part of town -- we're able to extrapolate projections of population shifting and have a much more finite view of opportunity. And when we identify opportunity, you have to be growing new store, do we buy a local entrepreneur or some combination of the two.\n\n---\n\nAnd the thing is, in the retail business, trade area has changed and the like, and with the large footprint we have, you are correct, we are -- we're in a lot of locations, but we also want to be where populations expand. We certainly, with the changing demographics of the country, want to be in certain locations. So there's still opportunity for us to grow the footprint. But I think Greg's point is the right one, which is we don't see and we don't have a dramatic, \"I'm going to come out with a number\" and make sure you get that number. I think it's better. I think we've really evolved, similar to what we talked about in Shawn's area with the -- what we call the acquisition and development process, our real estate process is much more sophisticated now as we go forward. So I think we have a good sense that there are incremental opportunities. Obviously, from a net perspective, we pulled out of Sears and Walmart and we think that was the right decision on every level.\n\n---\n\nGil Luria, Wedbush Securities. In terms of your vision for how the digital market is going to evolve. You talked a little bit about the fact that Intuit is bifurcating, it's lowering the price on the low-end, raising the price for a new chunk of -- new type of filings. But I think your commentary was that you expect in the future for the categories to converge. Could you explain why you think that would happen, and if it does, and if the category gets even more bifurcated, how does that impact your vision?\n\n---\n\nIt's definitely based on the idea that price is no longer a differentiator, because if you look at the value competitors, there's very little to them except price and that was why I think I said it 3 or 4 times and I said these are really web for -- tax forms as a webpage. There's very little more than that. And so you might say that that is of value to me if it's the lowest price, but if price is no longer something that differentiates, then my view is that those consumers have the same expectations at that point as the premium consumer. And then to your point about the bifurcation of the market leaders pricing strategy, that pricing strategy last year was used in online to both have a lower entry-level price for simple filers and then to the charge more for the more complex. And we're seeing it again in desktop. This year, the desktop SKUs have already launched. There in some stores, but they're already online, and if you look, there are multiple changes in the basic and deluxe product SKUs for the market leader, but the basic is probably the most pronounced and it's the example that I'll give you, but that product was $29.99 last year. This year, it's opening at $14.99. But it's only 1040EZ and 1040A. The schedule A and the 1040 was taken out of the basic product. So if I go in and buy that, I may see it as a good value, but there's a lot less there. At $14.99 now, if I'm a schedule A user, which 30% DIY-ers are, then I'm forced to upgrade to the $59.99 deluxe product. So that's really why I believe that in both the value and the premium that there are changes going on that leave us very well positioned, Gil.\n\n---\n\nLast year, the result of Intuit taking this strategy, was that they had a double-digit volume increase, but revenue per filing for them and by definition, for the industry came down. Aren't you concerned that, that's the trend going forward if they continue on this strategy?\n\n---\n\nWell, I think Bill said that we look at our own metric around growing. Tax Plus revenue is our primary objective. We've gained share in revenue 4 years in a row. Where I view the categories going is you've got to do both. I think that in order to lead in this area, you're going to have to do both and price as a lever is only really a onetime shot.\n\n---\n\nAnj Singh from Credit Suisse. This is for Greg and Shawn. I think I heard you guys say you're looking to acquire 650 franchised urban centers. I was wondering if you can discuss what sort of pace you anticipate that rolling out and if you can quantify a revenue opportunity there. More importantly, I was wondering, were these stores originally company-owned, then franchised, now company-owned again? Sort of what are the decisions that have driven that back and forth?\n\n---\n\nSo why don't you guys -- why don't you start, Greg?\n\n---\n\nSo I'll give you a bit of history. Block, as it began to expand 50 years ago, really said we're going to control the cities and the suburbs and franchising is the right solution for rural development. And there's real good reasons for that: Our average franchise only has 1 or 2 stores because the distance between them is 40, 50 miles. Husband runs one, the wife runs the other one. We find real synergies of management and control by being in the suburbs and cities. As times gone on, obviously, suburbs continue to expand. 4, 5 years ago, there was a decision that in some of the smaller markets like Raleigh, North Carolina, Scottsdale, Arizona, Springfield, Missouri, to take that city and its suburbs and sell them to franchise. As a gain on sale opportunity that obviously we didn't think created real value. That was a mistake from our perspective. Our franchisees do not run the stores better than we do. We believe that we can actually run a little bit better than they can. We don't have to put a lot of capital into it. So we're going back and looking at all those sales and saying, we think there's opportunity for us to create value here. This past 12 months, we've actually gone back and taken care most of those refranchising that happened, and so as we go into this tax season, not all them but the majority of them that were refranchised 4, 5 years ago are now back part of the H&R Block company system. So that means there are few sort of this transaction to go next year. We're not going to quantify much more than $100 million for now. I think at the end of the tax season, we'll give you some more information on that.\n\n---\n\nGot it. And as a follow-up, I'm not sure if I missed it, but at this juncture, do you have any better thinking around the incremental leverage opportunity that you've talked about, or is that something that's still too early to discuss?\n\n---\n\nYou're talking about the leverage for the whole company?\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nYes, I mean the answer is, unfortunately, similar to what we've talked about before, we're a low investment-grade rating rated company. We spend a lot of time thinking about that. We've announced publicly that we think there's value in maintaining that investment grade rating. We haven't given very specific guidance what exactly that means other than we want to maintain that investment grade rating post the bank transaction.\n\n---\n\nBut we have said that upon completion of that, the board and I have agreed that we're going to -- we will -- we were taking on incremental net debt. So we've talked about the excess capital and the incremental net debt and that's really the position we've taken at this point.\n\n---\n\nMichael?\n\n---\n\nI'm Michael Millman from Millman Research Associates. Kind of following up on some of the questions, particularly, the franchisee. Can you give us an idea of what the free cash flow is for a franchised system as opposed to an owned system?\n\n---\n\nAre you talking about from the company perspective, Mike?\n\n---\n\nFrom a company perspective.\n\n---\n\nWell, the economics are different. I mean right now, Block, on a franchise agreement, typically has a 30% royalty off revenues. We do incur costs around that, so it's not just doesn't go right to the bottom line. In fact, we've spent a fair amount of money on supporting our franchise. When it comes into the system, there's an initial outlay to buy that, but the ongoing fixed assets are relatively modest. You've seen 2% to 3% of revenues is the right model to think about. So we're trying to balance revenue growth at appropriate levels of margin, which translates still to superior ROIC, and so when we are well above our cost to capital, we think that's a compelling return for investors of excess capital.\n\n---\n\nAnd I think the other thing I would add in term of this decision, I mean, in the simplest terms, we do think that there is operating efficiency that having franchisees focus primarily in rural areas, while the company focuses urban and suburban does create a lot of efficiencies of management in the system. And on top of that, with the margin structure we're fortunate to have in this company, the ability to get 100% of the revenue from a company perspective, yet still return a very -- have a very healthy return at the bottom makes it pretty attractive for us equally to lean to the company side versus the franchise side. Having said that, 30% royalty rate with the efficiencies of them operating in small towns and communities really is a great combination for us. So a lot of times, people ask about the mix, we think the mix will stay, generally, how it is today.\n\n---\n\nAnd to change the subject a little bit, price -- can you talk about what you see over the next few years as your revenue per return, excluding some of these extras that we discussed today?\n\n---\n\nYou want to take that, Greg?\n\n---\n\nYes, I mean we've talked about this. We have pricing leverage and synergies are one of the benefits. We talked about the price last [indiscernible] number. What we have realized in the last 10 years at Block is greater than the rate of inflation. We're not going to give specific guidance for competitive reasons, but you should expect greater than the rate of inflation from pricing going forward on -- just all things being equal.\n\n---\n\nCan we go back to Scott.\n\n---\n\nScott Schneeberger again from Oppenheimer. Two if I could sneak it in. One on Identity Shield. Its new, it's differentiated versus your peers. I'm curious, what type of revenue opportunity, I know you may not want to speak to this year, but over the longer term, sounds like it might be a kin to your warranty product, which is about a $35 price point, $90 million of revenue a year. Is that the way to think about it? Trying to sell into the population and grow it as such?\n\n---\n\nYes, let me kick it off and then let Jason or Greg want to add anything. The context for this is the growing problem in the country that tax identity theft has suddenly emerged, as bad guys have figured out, \"Wow! There's $4,800 and $35 according to the 60-minute segment that I can get in what seems to be in pretty simple terms.\" So part of this is tied to what steps are taken to combat this particular issue. If it continues the way it is trending right now, we think it will be a very good addition to our Tax Plus strategy. But in terms of revenue projections or exactly what the pricing is, we're not prepared, we're not ready to go into that right yet. I don't know if anybody's got anything to add.\n\n---\n\nWell I think we're really excited about this product. What it gives the consumer is it gives them prevention, protection and remediation in case this happens. It's a growing problem. We're excited because we've got a great partner who knows a lot about the identity space and the identity theft space, but not specifically tax identity, which is really where we, specifically, see this hitting and it's similar to [indiscernible] and that it will really go out and be something that consumers like at all segments. This is the ones that Kathy mentioned earlier.\n\n---\n\nAnd then just a separate topic altogether. Bill, I'm curious, usually Latin market gets a lot of lip service every year at Investor Day and from all companies across the business. We saw at tobacco, across the presentations. Could you tie it together perhaps with regard to this buying back or this expansion of office strategy and the hiring numbers you provided and if you could just kind of put a bow on what the approach is this year and how you think you'll be differentiated there?\n\n---\n\nYes, and then I'll let Kathy add some information from the segmentation perspective. But I think that you've got the thesis. We have invested in our offices and a lot of those are in -- we have something called Latino designated offices where we have a number of a bilingual tax pros, we have a lot of materials that are bilingual. We're hiring more tax pros, we're training them, they're becoming more experienced, and then there's certainly a marketing investment.\n\n---\n\nSo interestingly enough, when we looked at the segmentation results, what we saw is that Latinos were spread equally across all the segments. Again, because the segmentation is based on needs and it's not a demographic segmentation. We saw that there were Latinos, very equally distributed across all of the segments, which really helps us, again, in our marketing efforts to those people; knowing who they are, what is relevant to them and how to best reach them.\n\n---\n\nAnd in our marketing efforts, you saw the one -- we have José who's kind of the emblem in the Latino community, we buy national media and UniVision and extensive radio efforts.\n\n---\n\nSo we have our Latino air coverage just like we have our general market air cover.\n\n---\n\nI think there is time for another question, down at the back there?\n\n---\n\nThis is Steve Rogers with Citi. Can you talk more about the simple filer tax market that people that would file a 1040EZ or 1040A and just talk about how do you win there and how do you see the market dynamics currently?\n\n---\n\nSo do you want to start with that, Kathy? And then maybe Jason or Mark, if you want to add something, because, obviously, Mark brought up the point that the 1040EZ market, probably by definition, almost will shrink this year because of -- you won't be able to file if you're in the Marketplace. Why don't you start for the segmentation?\n\n---\n\nSo again, if you look back at the segmentation and I mentioned this, but behavior or I guess, I should say form type or demographics do not really -- are not indicative of consumer behavior. So what we've seen, again, is that regardless of age, regardless of income and regardless of form type, consumers behave different ways. And so we're able to really reach them more on how we think that they're going to behave. You'll see that we have, effectively, with our one-to-one marketing, we've been able to identify who those early-season or those 1040EZ filers may be and reach them with the right message and the right offer at the right time, just to make sure that we're hitting them when it's most relevant, most timely.\n\n---\n\nAnd really, when we think about designing our products, we do think first in terms of the needs based and what jobs the consumers want. And so for instance, we don't just think about an EZ, we think about all the taxpayers who are DIY and their interest primarily in getting a refund. And so for instance this year, we have a new feature, it's called Refund Reveal. And this will be unique a product innovation that's unique to Block in the marketplace and it not only shows the consumer what their refund is, but it shows them how it was calculated. This is really -- that box in the upper left-hand corner that the user watches, they see it go up and down, but what we found during our research was there's a mystery about how it goes. What makes it go up and down so that was one of the insects as we think about the needs-based approach as opposed to a forms-based approach that led us to that innovation.\n\n---\n\nI would just also say don't confuse simple forms with what consumer's perception is about their taxes and just because you're using an EZ doesn't necessarily mean you would see your taxes as simple, and with the Affordable Care Act, Bill already mentioned, obviously, some of those EZ clients are no longer qualify for those forms and that number's going to go up as more people enroll in the Marketplace. Eventually, if it hits the HHS number of 25 million, you're going to see a substantial shrinking of the EZ market. But importantly, even EZ clients are going to be faced with potential refund effects from either penalty calculations, verification of their insurance coverage or exemptions. And so that's going to confront them as well even though they may be using what we call a simple-based tax form, and so we expect some of those do-it-yourself people that are confronting with that are going to have questions and they're going to need answers because their refund's going to be affected.\n\n---\n\nOkay, maybe one more in the back there?\n\n---\n\nThis is Jesse Rosenthal from CreditSights. Just a very quick question for Greg. Follow up on the leverage issue, I appreciate that you're just kind of getting through the bank deal first, but I was wondering if you had any preliminary discussions with the rating agencies or any plans to discuss with them once you kind of get to the point where you're trying to dimension exactly where you want to be.\n\n---\n\nYes and just to be clear, the ratings agency's joined us today, although I think I saw Ed [ph] sneak out, but anyway, we have regular conversations with the ratings agencies. It's part of just our relationship with them. We've had good open dialogue with them. We're proactive in sharing our ideas and thoughts with them, but we're not going to talk about specifics at this point.\n\n---\n\nOkay, there are no other questions. Just want to say, once again, thank you so much for coming out. We do appreciate your involvement today, and you all have a great day. Thank you.\n\n---\n\nThank you.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Scott Schneeberger (Analysts)】\nScott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. I guess we'll start off with the news of last evening with regard to Sand Canyon. Greg, could you just elaborate a little bit more on that? I don't think it's fully understood what the development is that you reported last night. So any further color will be helpful.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nYes, so it's an awkward time-line because it kind of happened after the end of the quarter, but before we released the quarterly report. But that doesn't really matter. What matters is obviously Sand Canyon's making forward progress on this issue. We are restricted in actually the specifics in which we can talk about, so unfortunately, I have to be a little bit vague. But specifically, there was a material development from a settlement with a counter party, that was involved from a [indiscernible] warrant claim, in our view in a positive way. I can't quantify that other than say it was a material amount of the reserve and the actual reserve in itself was fully contemplated in the reserves. There's no broader implication of the reserve amount.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Schneeberger (Analysts)】\nAnd just to follow up. I'm not sure if you can answer this, but it represents past claimants and those who may still be pursuing. Should we infer that this would cover all as of this date who are putting forth claims, and therefore, could be a permanent solution? Or would there still be incremental opportunity for others once this agreement is concluded?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nSo let me backtrack a little bit if that's okay. When we had shared this with you, which is probably 1.5 years ago the 6-year statute of limitations, which is what we believe is a matter of law has well expired at this point in time. So any new claimant that may show up at this point will have a very difficult time and the reality has been really no new claims to talk about. So really what this issue with Sand Canyon is focused on a limited number of counter parties that have a asserted claims that Sand Canyon felt was productive to enter into these towing [ph] arrangements, which was a way to stop the clock, and what we've announced yesterday was really one of those situations resolving.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nThomas?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thomas Allen (Analysts)】\nSo there's been a lot of chatter in the investment bank community about immigration reform and the potential benefits to you. You didn't touch much on it. Can we just get a little more -- couple of more thoughts on it?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nSo couple of things on that. First of all, the President came out with that speech a couple of weeks ago. There's a lot of conversation about that whole area. So -- excuse me, we're still watching that to see what that is. What I wouldn't say is I think we're really well positioned here because we are the #1. \r\n[Audio Gap] \r\nWe are the leader in terms of the number of Latino returns that we do today. We have made a big step up over the last 2 years in terms of the number of bilingual tax pros we have. And I think similar to ACA, we had anticipated that something like this would come. I do think this will happen. I think it's to the benefit of, frankly, both parties, that something happen before 2016. But specific to the proposal that came out a couple of weeks ago, we're going to wait and see where that settles out. But we think, in general, this is going to be a net benefit to us.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nIf you look at the details of their announcement, it's hard to understand how there'd be a direct benefit this tax season, specifically.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thomas Allen (Analysts)】\nAnd then follow-up. So on the bank sale, I mean there's been some chatter that the increased scrutiny of prepaid debit cards by the CFPB, and maybe some other regulatory changes is what's slowing down the process. Can you answer that comment or those thoughts?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nGreg, help me out if I don't phrase this right. I don't think it has any impact on the -- that's the CFPB and we're dealing with the OCC.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nThe CFPB guidance just came out. Obviously, we looked at it in detail and the good thing about product is we are pretty much in full compliance right now. There's always been broader concerns, in general, about debit cards, but specific to our application, we think they're independent.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nAll right.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thomas Allen (Analysts)】\nAnd there's no increased scrutiny by -- on any of your other financial products, or you think any changes in regulatory frameworks that could have an impact?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nI couldn't hear the questions.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thomas Allen (Analysts)】\nJust in terms of changes in the regulatory process, on your other products and on Emerald Advance and Emerald One, and I guess, refund transfer. No changes in the environment that should be slowing down?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nI mean these has been regulated for a number of years. We're operating the bank. Obviously, we're operating all those products. So no, I don't see any change to structure of our products or that this has any impact on the pending bank transaction.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nAnd just to be clear, I mean, I completely agree with Bill. I mean, we don't think there's an issue. But we've said very clear, to the regulator -- if there is an issue, you need to tell us because and we'd be happy to change the product very quickly to accommodate that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thomas Allen (Analysts)】\nAnd the regulators have said anything to you?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nThere's been no request to do anything.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nAs a reminder, if you don't mind, state your name and your company before asking the question. That'd be helpful.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\n[indiscernible]. Could you discuss the decision-making factors and the relative economics between buying an independent, taking in a franchise and adding a new store, first? And then secondly, can we assume that following the '15 tax season, you will have commensurately more excess capital relative to the $850 million to $1 billion that you discussed previously?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nSo Greg, why don't you -- I realize it's in Shawn's area, but I think this is more a financial question. So why don't you take that and Shawn, if there's anything you want to add at the end. Why don't you let Greg lead?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nYes, I mean specifically the first part you've got, do we open a new store? Do we buy back -- or do we  buy an independent buy back a franchise? All 3 represent compelling financial returns from our perspective and one thing about us right now is we have an abundance of capital.

And this is actually when Kathy did a really nice job of talking about how we're taking our data and understanding at a much level of greater detail with better analysis, and we're able to identify sides of the street corners, what part of town -- we're able to extrapolate projections of population shifting and have a much more finite view of opportunity.

But I think Greg's point is the right one, which is we don't see and we don't have a dramatic, \"I'm going to come out with a number\" and make sure you get that number. I think it's better. I think we've really evolved, similar to what we talked about in Shawn's area with the -- what we call the acquisition and development process, our real estate process is much more sophisticated now as we go forward. So I think we have a good sense that there are incremental opportunities. Obviously, from a net perspective, we pulled out of Sears and Walmart and we think that was the right decision on every level.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gil Luria (Analysts)】\nGil Luria, Wedbush Securities. In terms of your vision for how the digital market is going to evolve. You talked a little bit about the fact that Intuit is bifurcating, it's lowering the price on the low-end, raising the price for a new chunk of -- new type of filings. But I think your commentary was that you expect in the future for the categories to converge. Could you explain why you think that would happen, and if it does, and if the category gets even more bifurcated, how does that impact your vision?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nIt's definitely based on the idea that price is no longer a differentiator, because if you look at the value competitors, there's very little to them except price and that was why I think I said it 3 or 4 times and I said these are really web for -- tax forms as a webpage. There's very little more than that. And so you might say that that is of value to me if it's the lowest price, but if price is no longer something that differentiates, then my view is that those consumers have the same expectations at that point as the premium consumer. And then to your point about the bifurcation of the market leaders pricing strategy, that pricing strategy last year was used in online to both have a lower entry-level price for simple filers and then to the charge more for the more complex. And we're seeing it again in desktop. This year, the desktop SKUs have already launched. There in some stores, but they're already online, and if you look, there are multiple changes in the basic and deluxe product SKUs for the market leader, but the basic is probably the most pronounced and it's the example that I'll give you, but that product was $29.99 last year. This year, it's opening at $14.99. But it's only 1040EZ and 1040A. The schedule A and the 1040 was taken out of the basic product. So if I go in and buy that, I may see it as a good value, but there's a lot less there. At $14.99 now, if I'm a schedule A user, which 30% DIY-ers are, then I'm forced to upgrade to the $59.99 deluxe product. So that's really why I believe that in both the value and the premium that there are changes going on that leave us very well positioned, Gil.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gil Luria (Analysts)】\nLast year, the result of Intuit taking this strategy, was that they had a double-digit volume increase, but revenue per filing for them and by definition, for the industry came down. Aren't you concerned that, that's the trend going forward if they continue on this strategy?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nWell, I think Bill said that we look at our own metric around growing. Tax Plus revenue is our primary objective. We've gained share in revenue 4 years in a row. Where I view the categories going is you've got to do both. I think that in order to lead in this area, you're going to have to do both and price as a lever is only really a onetime shot.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Anjaneya Singh (Analysts)】\nAnj Singh from Credit Suisse. This is for Greg and Shawn. I think I heard you guys say you're looking to acquire 650 franchised urban centers. I was wondering if you can discuss what sort of pace you anticipate that rolling out and if you can quantify a revenue opportunity there. More importantly, I was wondering, were these stores originally company-owned, then franchised, now company-owned again? Sort of what are the decisions that have driven that back and forth?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nSo why don't you guys -- why don't you start, Greg?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nSo I'll give you a bit of history. Block, as it began to expand 50 years ago, really said we're going to control the cities and the suburbs and franchising is the right solution for rural development. And there's real good reasons for that: Our average franchise only has 1 or 2 stores because the distance between them is 40, 50 miles. Husband runs one, the wife runs the other one. We find real synergies of management and control by being in the suburbs and cities. As times gone on, obviously, suburbs continue to expand. 4, 5 years ago, there was a decision that in some of the smaller markets like Raleigh, North Carolina, Scottsdale, Arizona, Springfield, Missouri, to take that city and its suburbs and sell them to franchise. As a gain on sale opportunity that obviously we didn't think created real value. That was a mistake from our perspective. Our franchisees do not run the stores better than we do. We believe that we can actually run a little bit better than they can. We don't have to put a lot of capital into it. So we're going back and looking at all those sales and saying, we think there's opportunity for us to create value here. This past 12 months, we've actually gone back and taken care most of those refranchising that happened, and so as we go into this tax season, not all them but the majority of them that were refranchised 4, 5 years ago are now back part of the H&R Block company system. So that means there are few sort of this transaction to go next year. We're not going to quantify much more than $100 million for now. I think at the end of the tax season, we'll give you some more information on that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Anjaneya Singh (Analysts)】\nGot it. And as a follow-up, I'm not sure if I missed it, but at this juncture, do you have any better thinking around the incremental leverage opportunity that you've talked about, or is that something that's still too early to discuss?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nYou're talking about the leverage for the whole company?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Anjaneya Singh (Analysts)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nYes, I mean the answer is, unfortunately, similar to what we've talked about before, we're a low investment-grade rating rated company. We spend a lot of time thinking about that. We've announced publicly that we think there's value in maintaining that investment grade rating. We haven't given very specific guidance what exactly that means other than we want to maintain that investment grade rating post the bank transaction.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nBut we have said that upon completion of that, the board and I have agreed that we're going to -- we will -- we were taking on incremental net debt. So we've talked about the excess capital and the incremental net debt and that's really the position we've taken at this point.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Colby Brown (Executives)】\nMichael?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Millman (Analysts)】\nI'm Michael Millman from Millman Research Associates. Kind of following up on some of the questions, particularly, the franchisee. Can you give us an idea of what the free cash flow is for a franchised system as opposed to an owned system?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nAre you talking about from the company perspective, Mike?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Millman (Analysts)】\nFrom a company perspective.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nWell, the economics are different. I mean right now, Block, on a franchise agreement, typically has a 30% royalty off revenues. We do incur costs around that, so it's not just doesn't go right to the bottom line. In fact, we've spent a fair amount of money on supporting our franchise. When it comes into the system, there's an initial outlay to buy that, but the ongoing fixed assets are relatively modest. You've seen 2% to 3% of revenues is the right model to think about. So we're trying to balance revenue growth at appropriate levels of margin, which translates still to superior ROIC, and so when we are well above our cost to capital, we think that's a compelling return for investors of excess capital.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nAnd I think the other thing I would add in term of this decision, I mean, in the simplest terms, we do think that there is operating efficiency that having franchisees focus primarily in rural areas, while the company focuses urban and suburban does create a lot of efficiencies of management in the system. And on top of that, with the margin structure we're fortunate to have in this company, the ability to get 100% of the revenue from a company perspective, yet still return a very -- have a very healthy return at the bottom makes it pretty attractive for us equally to lean to the company side versus the franchise side. Having said that, 30% royalty rate with the efficiencies of them operating in small towns and communities really is a great combination for us. So a lot of times, people ask about the mix, we think the mix will stay, generally, how it is today.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Millman (Analysts)】\nAnd to change the subject a little bit, price -- can you talk about what you see over the next few years as your revenue per return, excluding some of these extras that we discussed today?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nYou want to take that, Greg?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nYes, I mean we've talked about this. We have pricing leverage and synergies are one of the benefits. We talked about the price last [indiscernible] number. What we have realized in the last 10 years at Block is greater than the rate of inflation. We're not going to give specific guidance for competitive reasons, but you should expect greater than the rate of inflation from pricing going forward on -- just all things being equal.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Colby Brown (Executives)】\nCan we go back to Scott.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Schneeberger (Analysts)】\nScott Schneeberger again from Oppenheimer. Two if I could sneak it in. One on Identity Shield. Its new, it's differentiated versus your peers. I'm curious, what type of revenue opportunity, I know you may not want to speak to this year, but over the longer term, sounds like it might be a kin to your warranty product, which is about a $35 price point, $90 million of revenue a year. Is that the way to think about it? Trying to sell into the population and grow it as such?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nYes, let me kick it off and then let Jason or Greg want to add anything. The context for this is the growing problem in the country that tax identity theft has suddenly emerged, as bad guys have figured out, \"Wow! There's $4,800 and $35 according to the 60-minute segment that I can get in what seems to be in pretty simple terms.\" So part of this is tied to what steps are taken to combat this particular issue. If it continues the way it is trending right now, we think it will be a very good addition to our Tax Plus strategy. But in terms of revenue projections or exactly what the pricing is, we're not prepared, we're not ready to go into that right yet. I don't know if anybody's got anything to add.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jason Houseworth (Executives)】\nWell I think we're really excited about this product. What it gives the consumer is it gives them prevention, protection and remediation in case this happens. It's a growing problem. We're excited because we've got a great partner who knows a lot about the identity space and the identity theft space, but not specifically tax identity, which is really where we, specifically, see this hitting and it's similar to [indiscernible] and that it will really go out and be something that consumers like at all segments. This is the ones that Kathy mentioned earlier.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Schneeberger (Analysts)】\nAnd then just a separate topic altogether. Bill, I'm curious, usually Latin market gets a lot of lip service every year at Investor Day and from all companies across the business. We saw at tobacco, across the presentations. Could you tie it together perhaps with regard to this buying back or this expansion of office strategy and the hiring numbers you provided and if you could just kind of put a bow on what the approach is this year and how you think you'll be differentiated there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nYes, and then I'll let Kathy add some information from the segmentation perspective. But I think that you've got the thesis. We have invested in our offices and a lot of those are in -- we have something called Latino designated offices where we have a number of a bilingual tax pros, we have a lot of materials that are bilingual. We're hiring more tax pros, we're training them, they're becoming more experienced, and then there's certainly a marketing investment.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kathy Collins (Executives)】\nSo interestingly enough, when we looked at the segmentation results, what we saw is that Latinos were spread equally across all the segments. Again, because the segmentation is based on needs and it's not a demographic segmentation. We saw that there were Latinos, very equally distributed across all of the segments, which really helps us, again, in our marketing efforts to those people; knowing who they are, what is relevant to them and how to best reach them.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nAnd in our marketing efforts, you saw the one -- we have José who's kind of the emblem in the Latino community, we buy national media and UniVision and extensive radio efforts.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kathy Collins (Executives)】\nSo we have our Latino air coverage just like we have our general market air cover.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nI think there is time for another question, down at the back there?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\nThis is Steve Rogers with Citi. Can you talk more about the simple filer tax market that people that would file a 1040EZ or 1040A and just talk about how do you win there and how do you see the market dynamics currently?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nSo do you want to start with that, Kathy? And then maybe Jason or Mark, if you want to add something, because, obviously, Mark brought up the point that the 1040EZ market, probably by definition, almost will shrink this year because of -- you won't be able to file if you're in the Marketplace. Why don't you start for the segmentation?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kathy Collins (Executives)】\nSo again, if you look back at the segmentation and I mentioned this, but behavior or I guess, I should say form type or demographics do not really -- are not indicative of consumer behavior. So what we've seen, again, is that regardless of age, regardless of income and regardless of form type, consumers behave different ways. And so we're able to really reach them more on how we think that they're going to behave. You'll see that we have, effectively, with our one-to-one marketing, we've been able to identify who those early-season or those 1040EZ filers may be and reach them with the right message and the right offer at the right time, just to make sure that we're hitting them when it's most relevant, most timely.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nAnd really, when we think about designing our products, we do think first in terms of the needs based and what jobs the consumers want. And so for instance, we don't just think about an EZ, we think about all the taxpayers who are DIY and their interest primarily in getting a refund. And so for instance this year, we have a new feature, it's called Refund Reveal. And this will be unique a product innovation that's unique to Block in the marketplace and it not only shows the consumer what their refund is, but it shows them how it was calculated. This is really -- that box in the upper left-hand corner that the user watches, they see it go up and down, but what we found during our research was there's a mystery about how it goes. What makes it go up and down so that was one of the insects as we think about the needs-based approach as opposed to a forms-based approach that led us to that innovation.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jason Houseworth (Executives)】\nI would just also say don't confuse simple forms with what consumer's perception is about their taxes and just because you're using an EZ doesn't necessarily mean you would see your taxes as simple, and with the Affordable Care Act, Bill already mentioned, obviously, some of those EZ clients are no longer qualify for those forms and that number's going to go up as more people enroll in the Marketplace. Eventually, if it hits the HHS number of 25 million, you're going to see a substantial shrinking of the EZ market. But importantly, even EZ clients are going to be faced with potential refund effects from either penalty calculations, verification of their insurance coverage or exemptions. And so that's going to confront them as well even though they may be using what we call a simple-based tax form, and so we expect some of those do-it-yourself people that are confronting with that are going to have questions and they're going to need answers because their refund's going to be affected.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Colby Brown (Executives)】\nOkay, maybe one more in the back there?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jesse Rosenthal (Analysts)】\nThis is Jesse Rosenthal from CreditSights. Just a very quick question for Greg. Follow up on the leverage issue, I appreciate that you're just kind of getting through the bank deal first, but I was wondering if you had any preliminary discussions with the rating agencies or any plans to discuss with them once you kind of get to the point where you're trying to dimension exactly where you want to be.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nYes and just to be clear, the ratings agency's joined us today, although I think I saw Ed [ph] sneak out, but anyway, we have regular conversations with the ratings agencies. It's part of just our relationship with them. We've had good open dialogue with them. We're proactive in sharing our ideas and thoughts with them, but we're not going to talk about specifics at this point.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Colby Brown (Executives)】\nOkay, there are no other questions. Just want to say, once again, thank you so much for coming out. We do appreciate your involvement today, and you all have a great day. Thank you.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nThank you.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you, Laurie, and good morning, everyone. I want to thank you for joining us today for Brown-Forman's Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Paul Varga, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Jane Morreau, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Fitzgerald, Chief Accounting Officer.\r\nThis morning's conference call contains forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Numerous risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or projected in these statements.\r\nMany of the factors that will determine future results are beyond the company's ability to control or predict. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, and the company undertakes no obligation to update any of these statements whether due to new information, future events or otherwise.\r\nThis morning, we issued a press release containing our results for the second quarter of fiscal 2015, and the release can be found on our website under the section titled Investor Relations. In the press release, we have listed a number of the risk factors that you should consider in conjunction with our forward-looking statements. Other significant risk factors are described in our Form 10-K, Form 8-K and Form 10-Q reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\r\nDuring this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures and the reasons management believes they provide useful information to investors regarding the company's financial conditions and results of operations are contained in the press release.\r\nAnd with that, I will turn the call over to Jane for her prepared remarks. Jane?\n\n---\n\nThanks, Jay, and thanks for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. I'm planning on covering 2 topics today, which should leave plenty of time to address Q&A after our prepared remarks: first, I will review our first half results, including recent trends in the second quarter; and second, I'll discuss our updated outlook for fiscal 2015. \r\nSo let's get started by reviewing our recent results. As expected, second quarter underlying net sales of 7% represented a solid acceleration from our first quarter's 3% growth and resulted in first half underlying net sales growth of approximately 5.5%. You'll recall that the first quarter was negatively impacted by trade inventory adjustments in the United States, United Kingdom and Germany. \r\nSo let's look at the United States, where underlying net sales rebounded from flat sales growth in the first quarter to an increase of 10% in the second quarter, as U.S. retail trade inventory levels began to normalize. This resulted in our first half underlying net sales growth of 5% in the U.S. On prior calls, we have discussed our efforts to drive a more balanced mix of price and volume growth in the United States in fiscal 2015, and U.S. syndicated data from Nielsen and NABCA suggest we're accomplishing this goal. Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey blended 3-month value trends are up over 6%, a 3.5 point acceleration from the 12-month trends we were experiencing at the start of the fiscal year. Lower gas prices appear to be helping to drive better on-premise trends and a modest acceleration in TDS. \r\nMoving now to our developed markets outside of the U.S. Underlying net sales increased 8% in the second quarter, a significant improvement from the first quarter's 1% decline and driving our year-to-date underlying net sales growth of 4%. A strong sequential acceleration in underlying net sales growth in the United Kingdom led to a high single-digit increase in the first half. Underlying net sales in Germany grew slightly in the second quarter, but our year-to-date results in that market are still down mid-single digits due to continued variability in trade buying patterns.\r\nFrance and our [indiscernible] Swiss markets grew double digits. Canada continued to grow nicely, while results in Japan were flat and Australia declined slightly. \r\nUnderlying sales in emerging markets grew 8% year-to-date. Results were particularly strong in Turkey, Brazil, Ukraine, sub-Sahara Africa and Indonesia. It's worth noting that our recent initiatives in South Africa are driving strong gains in a very competitive marketplace. Russia's growth stalled in October due in part to a depreciating currency and waning consumer confidence, which have negatively impacted consumer demand in that market. Mexico's underlying net sales grew slightly in the first half following the first quarter's growth on easy comparisons. Poland's underlying net sales declined double digits as the market continued to struggle as -- at the large excise tax increase taken at the start of calendar 2014. Excluding Poland and Mexico, our emerging markets grew underlying net sales 22% in the first half. \r\nWe estimate that after accounting for retail inventory adjustments in the U.S. and Germany, our overall first half underlying net sales grew over 6%, in line with the low end of our outlook we shared with you for fiscal 2015. \r\nOn a brand basis, our results accelerated sequentially due largely to the Jack Daniel's family of brands, which grew underlying net sales by 9% in the second quarter, up from the 5% in the first quarter. Woodford Reserve and Old Forester also enjoyed strong double-digit gains as favorable dynamics continued to support the growth of our authentic American whiskey brands. Finlandia  Vodka's underlying net sales declined 6% year-to-date due to continued softness in Poland. Southern Comfort's underlying net sales declined 4%. And el Jimador and Herradura's underlying net sales both grew nicely in the first half, up 4% and 19%, respectively. \r\nMoving now to the reconciliation of underlying to reported growth for our first 6 months. The big story is the rapid appreciation of the U.S. dollar, which is driving a large difference between our reported and underlying results throughout the P&L even after considering our hedges. The movement of our key currencies has been significant over the last few months with most of them depreciating versus the U.S. dollar. The euro, for example, is down roughly 7% since our call for the first quarter in late August. \r\nLet's start by looking at sales, where our top line grew 5.5% on an underlying basis fueled by equal contributions of volume growth and price/mix. Foreign exchange negatively impacted our reported net sales by 3 percentage points in the second quarter and 1 percentage point year-to-date. \r\nUnderlying gross profit grew faster than net sales, up 7% as improving price/mix helped drive a 40 basis point improvement in gross margin. \r\nUnderlying A&P spend increased 5%, while underlying SG&A grew 10%. The increase in SG&A was driven primarily by our France route-to-market investments, some onetime items and the investments in our people, processes and systems to drive our company's continued globalization. We expected elevated SG&A growth to not subside -- we expect elevated SG&A growth to not subside until we move into the fourth quarter and lap such items as the January 1 route-to-market investments we have been making in France. \r\nSo putting this all together, we delivered 6% underlying income growth in the first half of fiscal 2015. Foreign exchange headwinds hurt our reported operating income growth more than reported sales through the combined and roughly equal effects of a transactional impact on net exposure and revaluation of net current assets denominated in foreign currencies. As our non-U.S. business has expanded, so have our overseas net assets, particularly cash, and most notably in Europe. These revaluations are captured in the $17 million negative swing in the other income and expense line on the P&L. \r\nFor the first half of fiscal year, foreign exchange negatively affected operating income by $33 million, equivalent to a 7 percentage point hit to our operating income growth and a $0.10 drag on reported EPS, which came in at $1.67. \r\nSo now moving on to my second and final topic for this morning, an update on our outlook for fiscal 2015. We have a significant presence in the American whiskey category, which is enjoying favorable trends. Global demand for the category continues to grow, and we believe that we have the best American whiskey portfolio in the world measured by breadth, global appeal and leadership of the category's development. \r\nWe continue to invest in our brands, our people and our markets with an eye towards delivering market-leading returns for our shareholders. And with consumer takeaway trends in the U.S. acting as a tailwind, coupled with our disciplined approach to innovation, we believe we are well positioned to drive long-term growth through further development of our whiskey brands. \r\nToday, we are reconfirming the ranges we shared with you for our full year outlook for underlying net sales growth of 6% to 8%. This rate of growth would represent significant outperformance of our competitive set, given their flat to modest declines over the last 12 months. The 6% to 8% range also assumes continued momentum in our U.S. business, stable economic conditions in Europe and no further disruption from markets such as Russia. \r\nWe also announced today the nationwide rollout of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire later this fiscal year after several months of strong and very positive response from consumers and the trade. We believe that this brand extension will help us seize one of the largest and fastest-growing opportunities in flavored whiskeys with a premium cinnamon-flavored whiskey under the Jack Daniel's trademark. But given the time needed to gain distribution and build momentum with consumers, we expect minimal impact on our underlying net sales and underlying operating income growth rates this fiscal year. And most of the positive impact from pipeline fill in the fourth quarter will be offset by investments to support the successful launch of the brand. \r\nWe also anticipate delivering 9% to 11% growth in underlying operating income. So while we will remain thoughtful in how we invest in A&P and SG&A, the pace and timing of our P&L investments will determine where within the range we land as we continue to find good opportunities to drive long-term growth through investments in our brands and our people. \r\nMoving now to foreign exchange. Assuming current spot rates as well as our existing hedges, the foreign exchange headwinds that hurt our first half reported results are expected to continue to negatively impact our reported results in the back half of fiscal 2015. We anticipate foreign exchange will adversely impact our full year operating income by approximately $45 million to $50 million, removing 4 to 5 points from reported growth in fiscal 2015 and about $0.15 from EPS. This EPS headwind is $0.09 worse than our first quarter outlook of a $0.06 negative impact from foreign exchange. This is the principal driver for our revised EPS outlook for the year of $3.15 to $3.35. \r\nAs a sensitivity, assuming our foreign currency cash exposure collectively moves 10% in either direction, our EPS over the balance of the year would be impacted by approximately $0.07. \r\nSo to summarize, our underlying business fundamentals remain robust, and we are confident about our future growth prospects despite the challenging trading environment for the industry. We are investing heavily to meet future demand as seen through the large-scale distillery, warehouse and home place investments at Jack Daniel's Woodford Reserve and Old Forester. Meanwhile, we continue our track record of returning capital to shareholders through dividend growth as well as our share buybacks. \r\nSo before I turn the call over to Paul for his comments, we wanted to say how much we're looking forward to spending more time with you next Wednesday, December 10, in New York, where we plan to share our perspective on Brown-Forman's future growth prospects and positioning in the marketplace and our continued excitement for our American whiskey portfolio. Paul?\n\n---\n\nThanks, Jane. Good morning, everybody. I'll be brief here, but I just wanted to add a couple of additional comments. \r\nOverall, I was pleased with the quarter, as we did see the acceleration in underlying net sales that we had anticipated when we spoke with you back in the summer. It was nice -- particularly nice to see the U.S. Jack Daniel's Black Label acceleration. It has been some time since we've seen quarterly takeaway growth in the U.S. at this level. So this has been particularly encouraging for all of us. \r\nYou would have seen that the adverse impact of foreign exchange is an unwelcome reality for the company just now, but I am heartened by the fact that the first half underlying results generally met our expectations. And as Jane mentioned, they continue to compare quite favorably to what we observe from our global competitive set. \r\nNow as we've commented many times in the past, our wonderful Jack Daniel's brand is the primary driver of this differential performance, and I'm going to cite just 3 of the ways in which we believe Jack does this. \r\nFirst, as the undisputed leader of American whiskey, premium priced or otherwise, Jack Daniel's, along with some of our other well-performing premium bourbon brands, like Woodford Reserve and Old Forester, disproportionally skew the company to one of the hottest categories in our industry right now. And we continue to believe that American whiskey is still at a relatively early stage of global development. \r\nSecondly, Jack Daniel's widespread global consumer appeal is the source of the company's exceptional geographic balance and diversification today. The benefits of this geographic breadth are not only that it provides Brown-Forman with a larger consumer marketplace and much longer runway for growth than a more limited geographic scope might, but it also enables us to weather those periodic regional or country setbacks that inevitably come along over time. Poland and Russia are 2 such examples in the results we've reported today. This vast geographic footprint also carries with it foreign exchange volatility that is also evident today. But we consider this a very acceptable risk for the benefits of geographic diversification. \r\nAnd then third, the strength of the parent Jack Daniel's Black Label brand provides the foundation for thoughtful, meaningful line extensions such as Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey, which has been a noteworthy contributor to the company's growth over the last few years. And with today's announcement that we'll be expanding Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire nationally in the U.S., we are hopeful that it will follow the successful lead provided by Gentleman Jack, Tennessee Honey and the Jack Daniel's RTDs over the last 20 years or so. \r\nSo favorable category concentration, geographic breadth and diversification and impactful innovation, all driven by Jack Daniel's, are 3 of the primary factors that we believe account today for our company's favorable and differential performance. Accordingly, we will continue to invest in these areas and, of course, behind the Jack Daniel's trademark. \r\nThis concludes our prepared remarks for this morning, and we're now happy to take any questions that you have.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Jason Koval (Executives)】\nThank you, Laurie, and good morning, everyone. I want to thank you for joining us today for Brown-Forman's Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Paul Varga, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Jane Morreau, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Fitzgerald, Chief Accounting Officer.\r\nThis morning's conference call contains forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Numerous risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or projected in these statements.\r\nMany of the factors that will determine future results are beyond the company's ability to control or predict. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, and the company undertakes no obligation to update any of these statements whether due to new information, future events or otherwise.\r\nThis morning, we issued a press release containing our results for the second quarter of fiscal 2015, and the release can be found on our website under the section titled Investor Relations. In the press release, we have listed a number of the risk factors that you should consider in conjunction with our forward-looking statements. Other significant risk factors are described in our Form 10-K, Form 8-K and Form 10-Q reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\r\nDuring this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures and the reasons management believes they provide useful information to investors regarding the company's financial conditions and results of operations are contained in the press release.\r\nAnd with that, I will turn the call over to Jane for her prepared remarks. Jane?\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nThanks, Jay, and thanks for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. I'm planning on covering 2 topics today, which should leave plenty of time to address Q&A after our prepared remarks: first, I will review our first half results, including recent trends in the second quarter; and second, I'll discuss our updated outlook for fiscal 2015. \r\nSo let's get started by reviewing our recent results. As expected, second quarter underlying net sales of 7% represented a solid acceleration from our first quarter's 3% growth and resulted in first half underlying net sales growth of approximately 5.5%. You'll recall that the first quarter was negatively impacted by trade inventory adjustments in the United States, United Kingdom and Germany. \r\nSo let's look at the United States, where underlying net sales rebounded from flat sales growth in the first quarter to an increase of 10% in the second quarter, as U.S. retail trade inventory levels began to normalize. This resulted in our first half underlying net sales growth of 5% in the U.S. On prior calls, we have discussed our efforts to drive a more balanced mix of price and volume growth in the United States in fiscal 2015, and U.S. syndicated data from Nielsen and NABCA suggest we're accomplishing this goal. Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey blended 3-month value trends are up over 6%, a 3.5 point acceleration from the 12-month trends we were experiencing at the start of the fiscal year. Lower gas prices appear to be helping to drive better on-premise trends and a modest acceleration in TDS. \r\nMoving now to our developed markets outside of the U.S. Underlying net sales increased 8% in the second quarter, a significant improvement from the first quarter's 1% decline and driving our year-to-date underlying net sales growth of 4%. A strong sequential acceleration in underlying net sales growth in the United Kingdom led to a high single-digit increase in the first half. Underlying net sales in Germany grew slightly in the second quarter, but our year-to-date results in that market are still down mid-single digits due to continued variability in trade buying patterns.\r\nFrance and our [indiscernible] Swiss markets grew double digits. Canada continued to grow nicely, while results in Japan were flat and Australia declined slightly. \r\nUnderlying sales in emerging markets grew 8% year-to-date. Results were particularly strong in Turkey, Brazil, Ukraine, sub-Sahara Africa and Indonesia. It's worth noting that our recent initiatives in South Africa are driving strong gains in a very competitive marketplace. Russia's growth stalled in October due in part to a depreciating currency and waning consumer confidence, which have negatively impacted consumer demand in that market. Mexico's underlying net sales grew slightly in the first half following the first quarter's growth on easy comparisons. Poland's underlying net sales declined double digits as the market continued to struggle as -- at the large excise tax increase taken at the start of calendar 2014. Excluding Poland and Mexico, our emerging markets grew underlying net sales 22% in the first half. \r\nWe estimate that after accounting for retail inventory adjustments in the U.S. and Germany, our overall first half underlying net sales grew over 6%, in line with the low end of our outlook we shared with you for fiscal 2015. \r\nOn a brand basis, our results accelerated sequentially due largely to the Jack Daniel's family of brands, which grew underlying net sales by 9% in the second quarter, up from the 5% in the first quarter. Woodford Reserve and Old Forester also enjoyed strong double-digit gains as favorable dynamics continued to support the growth of our authentic American whiskey brands. Finlandia  Vodka's underlying net sales declined 6% year-to-date due to continued softness in Poland. Southern Comfort's underlying net sales declined 4%. And el Jimador and Herradura's underlying net sales both grew nicely in the first half, up 4% and 19%, respectively. \r\nMoving now to the reconciliation of underlying to reported growth for our first 6 months. The big story is the rapid appreciation of the U.S. dollar, which is driving a large difference between our reported and underlying results throughout the P&L even after considering our hedges. The movement of our key currencies has been significant over the last few months with most of them depreciating versus the U.S. dollar. The euro, for example, is down roughly 7% since our call for the first quarter in late August. \r\nLet's start by looking at sales, where our top line grew 5.5% on an underlying basis fueled by equal contributions of volume growth and price/mix. Foreign exchange negatively impacted our reported net sales by 3 percentage points in the second quarter and 1 percentage point year-to-date. \r\nUnderlying gross profit grew faster than net sales, up 7% as improving price/mix helped drive a 40 basis point improvement in gross margin. \r\nUnderlying A&P spend increased 5%, while underlying SG&A grew 10%. The increase in SG&A was driven primarily by our France route-to-market investments, some onetime items and the investments in our people, processes and systems to drive our company's continued globalization. We expected elevated SG&A growth to not subside -- we expect elevated SG&A growth to not subside until we move into the fourth quarter and lap such items as the January 1 route-to-market investments we have been making in France. \r\nSo putting this all together, we delivered 6% underlying income growth in the first half of fiscal 2015. Foreign exchange headwinds hurt our reported operating income growth more than reported sales through the combined and roughly equal effects of a transactional impact on net exposure and revaluation of net current assets denominated in foreign currencies. As our non-U.S. business has expanded, so have our overseas net assets, particularly cash, and most notably in Europe. These revaluations are captured in the $17 million negative swing in the other income and expense line on the P&L. \r\nFor the first half of fiscal year, foreign exchange negatively affected operating income by $33 million, equivalent to a 7 percentage point hit to our operating income growth and a $0.10 drag on reported EPS, which came in at $1.67. \r\nSo now moving on to my second and final topic for this morning, an update on our outlook for fiscal 2015. We have a significant presence in the American whiskey category, which is enjoying favorable trends. Global demand for the category continues to grow, and we believe that we have the best American whiskey portfolio in the world measured by breadth, global appeal and leadership of the category's development. \r\nWe continue to invest in our brands, our people and our markets with an eye towards delivering market-leading returns for our shareholders. And with consumer takeaway trends in the U.S. acting as a tailwind, coupled with our disciplined approach to innovation, we believe we are well positioned to drive long-term growth through further development of our whiskey brands. \r\nToday, we are reconfirming the ranges we shared with you for our full year outlook for underlying net sales growth of 6% to 8%. This rate of growth would represent significant outperformance of our competitive set, given their flat to modest declines over the last 12 months. The 6% to 8% range also assumes continued momentum in our U.S. business, stable economic conditions in Europe and no further disruption from markets such as Russia. \r\nWe also announced today the nationwide rollout of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire later this fiscal year after several months of strong and very positive response from consumers and the trade. We believe that this brand extension will help us seize one of the largest and fastest-growing opportunities in flavored whiskeys with a premium cinnamon-flavored whiskey under the Jack Daniel's trademark. But given the time needed to gain distribution and build momentum with consumers, we expect minimal impact on our underlying net sales and underlying operating income growth rates this fiscal year. And most of the positive impact from pipeline fill in the fourth quarter will be offset by investments to support the successful launch of the brand. \r\nWe also anticipate delivering 9% to 11% growth in underlying operating income. So while we will remain thoughtful in how we invest in A&P and SG&A, the pace and timing of our P&L investments will determine where within the range we land as we continue to find good opportunities to drive long-term growth through investments in our brands and our people. \r\nMoving now to foreign exchange. Assuming current spot rates as well as our existing hedges, the foreign exchange headwinds that hurt our first half reported results are expected to continue to negatively impact our reported results in the back half of fiscal 2015. We anticipate foreign exchange will adversely impact our full year operating income by approximately $45 million to $50 million, removing 4 to 5 points from reported growth in fiscal 2015 and about $0.15 from EPS. This EPS headwind is $0.09 worse than our first quarter outlook of a $0.06 negative impact from foreign exchange. This is the principal driver for our revised EPS outlook for the year of $3.15 to $3.35. \r\nAs a sensitivity, assuming our foreign currency cash exposure collectively moves 10% in either direction, our EPS over the balance of the year would be impacted by approximately $0.07. \r\nSo to summarize, our underlying business fundamentals remain robust, and we are confident about our future growth prospects despite the challenging trading environment for the industry. We are investing heavily to meet future demand as seen through the large-scale distillery, warehouse and home place investments at Jack Daniel's Woodford Reserve and Old Forester. Meanwhile, we continue our track record of returning capital to shareholders through dividend growth as well as our share buybacks. \r\nSo before I turn the call over to Paul for his comments, we wanted to say how much we're looking forward to spending more time with you next Wednesday, December 10, in New York, where we plan to share our perspective on Brown-Forman's future growth prospects and positioning in the marketplace and our continued excitement for our American whiskey portfolio. Paul?\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nThanks, Jane. Good morning, everybody. I'll be brief here, but I just wanted to add a couple of additional comments. \r\nOverall, I was pleased with the quarter, as we did see the acceleration in underlying net sales that we had anticipated when we spoke with you back in the summer. It was nice -- particularly nice to see the U.S. Jack Daniel's Black Label acceleration. It has been some time since we've seen quarterly takeaway growth in the U.S. at this level.

Accordingly, we will continue to invest in these areas and, of course, behind the Jack Daniel's trademark. \r\nThis concludes our prepared remarks for this morning, and we're now happy to take any questions that you have.",
      "transcript_text3": "So my first question has to do with the strong acceleration that you saw in the United States, in particular for Jack Daniel's. From time to time, we've discussed potential for a competitive disruption to the brown spirit renaissance from your vodka competitors. So can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing from the competitive stance, in particular from the white spirit players in the market?\n\n---\n\nSure. I mean, as I just commented, we were pleased to see this acceleration not only in the results that Jane discussed but also at some of the syndicated data that supports improved consumer takeaway. I mean, as I think about it, there are a couple of things that we might point to. Of course, the category continues to do very, very well, but the category has been doing well for some time. And the jump that we've seen in the Jack Daniel's Black Label trends recently, we think, may be attributable to a couple of factors. One is this year, relative to past, we think we just have improved relative pricing. We had been quite aggressive in the U.S. and consistent over the last couple of years of taking prices. And I think in some places around the country, we got ahead of some of our competitive set and particularly at a time when the consumer might not have had as much disposable income. So you put together the fact that we have improved relative pricing, even though we haven't been like dramatically lowering prices, it's just that others have caught up to us as we've been less aggressive with pricing this year. And you put that together with maybe this benefit that the consumer is seeing from lower fuel prices, which might be giving them better discretionary income, and I think we might be at a sweet spot where it's easier for our consumer, who drinks this on occasion, to trade up more frequently, is maybe the bottom line. And then I would add to it, entering FY '15, we consciously mobilized our U.S. sales and marketing teams in the United States with a renewed focus on the Jack Daniel's Black Label brand. I mean, we -- in some ways, we're -- I would call it asserting our category leadership. I mean, just making sure we weren't taking for granted the fact that Brown-Forman was the leader of the American whiskey business in the United States at a time when it was booming and that, therefore, it made it, of course, more competitive. And I just think in some ways, through either investment, focus, just the heavy reminder of the importance of Jack Daniel's Black Label to Brown-Forman in its home country at a time that's very important for the category has really helped to focus attention promotionally and, from an investment standpoint, to also add to it. So I think the combination of that improved relative pricing, maybe improved posture from the consumer and then our promotional efforts around it may be the primary factors contributing to the uptick.\n\n---\n\nThat's very helpful. Can you just remind us what your hedging strategy is, whether today's transactions, translation, a little bit of both? And then to follow up on that, the implications for lapping some of the expense hits that you're seeing right now as you go into '16.\n\n---\n\nSure. So just to give you a little background on our hedging philosophy, I think that's what you're asking for, is first of all, we aren't in the market for speculating about FX. We have never done that. And we don't hedge in excess of our underlying net exposures either, and we don't fully hedge our transaction exposures. So in other words, we're not in to take a -- get a 100% mitigated exposure all taken care of or we wouldn't go the other way and have none. So what instead we do, we do something that we call more like you're used to, dollar cost averaging, so that we're -- over any period of time, a 12-month period of time, you would see about 50% of our transactional exposure, if you will, hedged. And so I thought -- while I'm here, I thought I might just spend a little bit more talking about FX because I'm sure there's going to be more color to this. And think about what happened in our first half of the year, the $0.10. And I thought I'm going to spend a minute and break it down a bit more, because what I was just referring to largely centered around our transactional exposure. And our transactional exposure I'm referring to is really our business, our ongoing business or our sales of our product less the expenses to sell those products, so our people, our advertising and spending that we would do in foreign currency as well as any cost that might be incurred in a local market. And so when I look at that $0.10 that we had hurt our results in the first half, about half of it was due to that and that -- and was -- if you looked at the currency shifts, as I said early on, how much they moved in just a couple of months' period of time, it was pretty dramatic. The other half of it -- but it worked as we planned in terms of how we hedge and what we would have been expecting in terms of our net exposure. The other half of it is what I was referring to that shows up on the other income and expense line item, and it is referred to as our net assets, largely cash in this case. And I think I referred to in the first quarter, we had -- so out of that other $0.05 hit we had a like $0.02 hit in the first quarter that was onetime in nature that related to an intercompany transaction. The remaining $0.03 was really driven by the revaluation of cash balances that we have, growing cash balances that would become bigger overseas. So when I look ahead and think about what to expect for the rest of the year, this piece that I'm talking about, the $0.05 piece I'm talking about, I would say that, that is done and behind us. It's the transactional piece that you still have exposure on, meaning at today's spot rates and you compare to what we're looking to do for the rest of the year compared to those spot rates, you've got downside. And that's where the $0.05 was coming from. So when you think about the FX and how much is ongoing versus how much is onetime in nature, I would split them in 2 pieces and then think of the rest of this year as $0.05. You're right in terms of the following year. Until we start lapping these rates, you'll still have some downside in F '16. So...\n\n---\n\nThat's -- exactly. That's very helpful. My last question has to do on Australia. I think recently, Diageo announced that they had reduced the ADD [ph] on some of their ready-to-drink products. I know that's a big ready-to-drink market for you guys as well. Have you guys made any adjustments to your ADD [ph]?\n\n---\n\nYes. And so Vivien, that's something that we constantly look at. We're looking at our proof and consumers and what they're looking for and what they see in the products and what they're wanting in our products all the time. We actually are currently, and have been for a number of years -- the SoCo RTDs, our Southern Comfort RTDs, in that market have been at that rate that Diageo was lowering their Smirnoff down to and Captain Morgan -- they did some time ago -- we're already there. And so -- but we don't have any plans for our premium Jack Daniel's RTDs, to reduce them to those rates at this time. But it's an ongoing thing that we always look at and consider the consumers while we're at it. It's interesting to note, we do have an RTD, that we do have at a lower proof than even the Diageo one. And it's more for special events, like your camps and mining and different things like that where the alcohol products are allowed to be sold, but at a much lower rate. So -- but no plans right now.\n\n---\n\nAnd I'll tell you -- I will add that, that move by Diageo is, I suspect, a direct reflection of them trying to remain competitive given what's been going on in that country with what I consider to be excessive excise taxation. And so one of the tools available to any of the brand owners is to reformulate in order to make the products to continue to be affordable and attractive to consumers. So you do end up having a trade-off between alcohol content and price. And so their move, in my view, is understandable.\n\n---\n\nYes, absolutely.\n\n---\n\nYes. Just a couple of quick questions for me. On the pricing, you had a -- it looked like a real nice result. Just I was wondering if you can break it down for us in terms of rate and mix. And just provide some context around that. And then the second and third questions, just quickly, are you guys doing Jack -- Winter Jack this season? I usually buy for Thanksgiving. I didn't see it in the stores. So just curious if you guys are going to have that back out there as we think about comparisons versus 1 year ago. And then just the last question is, the guidance really looks like it's implying a nice acceleration in the back half of the year. And if Jack Fire is not really the --  going to be a big driver of that, I'm just curious on what will be the driver.\n\n---\n\nYes. By the way, where do you live? We're going to make sure that in your liquor stores, we've got Jack Daniel's Winter Jack.\n\n---\n\nIt will be available, yes, right.\n\n---\n\nIt should be, yes.\n\n---\n\nMaybe it was sold out.\n\n---\n\nYes, there you go. But yes, we are planning on selling it. In terms of the -- of pricing, recall at the beginning of the year when we communicated that, and I think we're very much on track to deliver this price/mix that we've been talking about. But we took very -- Paul already alluded to it. After 2 years of really hefty, strong pricing in the U.S. in 4% to 5% range, 2 consecutive years of those rates, we chose in the U.S. to moderate, take time out, get some of the competitors to catch up from a relative perspective. And so it's very low, about a percent is all we were planning. But we were still planning pricing outside the U.S. And so we are still seeing pricing coming in from -- coming from outside of the U.S. And we're expecting, I believe, when we talked about this early on, that we were expecting about 1/3 of our growth in net sales to come from pricing for the year. So I think we're still on target on that. And then your question in terms of the acceleration on the back half of the year, I think one of the things you have to think about is what happened in the first quarter. We -- there was only a 3% growth rate in the first quarter. We had tough comps in the first quarter. We talked to what was going on. It was largely retail inventory, if you will, and we adjusted for that, and we come along -- we knew we were going to get an acceleration in the second quarter. We grew 7% in the second quarter. I don't expect that 7% to slow down for the balance of the year. So -- in fact, when we get to our fourth quarter, we had a pretty weak fourth quarter in a couple of markets. Particularly, we've been talking about for some time in Poland and Germany, and we're expecting a rebound in both of those places. They had some buy-ins in their third quarter of last year. And so that -- we're not even including Fire in that. These are the things that we're talking about that will give us a lift in our sales growth, so.\n\n---\n\nAlong with the U.S. acceleration that we've been seeing. I mean, I think that...\n\n---\n\nAnd the U.S. [indiscernible].\n\n---\n\nWe're certainly dependent on that continued performance in the U.S. from Jack Daniel's Black Label as one of the contributing factors, whereas -- again, it was another piece of the business that...\n\n---\n\nWas slower.\n\n---\n\nWas slower in the first quarter than it will be through the remainder of the 9 months. So when you think about key markets in Europe and you think about the U.S. and then focus on the results for second quarter and think about that over the remainder of the second half, it can account for the kind of guidance we're giving you.\n\n---\n\nYes, exactly. And back on your question on Fire, though. Again, just to reiterate what we said in terms of the timing of this, this is a late fiscal year introduction. The time that it's going to take to get into the system from a distribution, and really for the consumer to start pulling in and so forth like that, we really are -- we've written down ...\n\n---\n\nVery modest.\n\n---\n\nVery, very minimal, if any, a very small amount in the forecast. And then we know there will be a pipeline. So our reported results will get some benefit from that at the top. By the time you get to the bottom, it's minimal, too, because we want to introduce this brand in the best way we can and, to be successful, invest -- we're investing a lot to support the launch.\n\n---\n\nI had a couple of questions, really more around your markets outside the U.S. So first, maybe just touch on the U.K. and Germany related to, number one, if all of the trade inventory volatility, if that's behind us now, so we see more normalized buying patterns going forward. And then if you strip out the inventory movement, what are you really seeing from an underlying perspective? And then the second question is really related to Russia. I know it's only 2% of your business, but clearly a pretty volatile situation. So how much of risk are you factoring in as you look out for the next 6 months, 12 months? And what are you -- what have you noticed so far just in terms of your trends in that market?\n\n---\n\nLots of questions. Great, Judy. Yes, in terms of the -- what we're seeing in the markets outside the U.S., particularly you're focusing on the U.K. and Germany and those were the 2 markets we called out in our first quarter outside the U.S. that were having some disruptions in trade inventory adjustments. The U.K. is back in balance. So in our numbers, they had a great second quarter, and they're back in balance. They're growing half single digits year-to-date.\n\n---\n\nDid very well in Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey, too.\n\n---\n\nAbsolutely. Thanks, Paul. And then Germany is still going through a period of, I would call it buying disruptions, if you will. It's an interesting market right now. The economy is pretty difficult. We have set for ourselves a -- what we believe is the right strategy as it relates to the price positioning of our brands. The retail market there, as you can imagine, is very challenged with the economy and looking to take prices down. And so we continue to work through this situation with them, with our retail partners in that market. But we have not worked through all that yet. So as I've noted in our script today, we still have a little bit of hangover, if you will, from retail adjustments in the U.S. and in Germany. And so if we take in consideration -- those are the 2 primary markets left that we have that occurring in. If you take the 5.5% underlying growth that we reported this morning and adjust for these 2 things, you're over 6% underlying growth.\n\n---\n\nOkay.\n\n---\n\nGot it, okay. And then...\n\n---\n\nYou had 2 questions. Oh, yes, the Russian.\n\n---\n\nYes, and Russia, yes.\n\n---\n\nI think on Russia, Jane alluded to it a bit in her comments. But I think the thing that we're focused on, I mean, it's a place where of course, as it relates to any relevance for our company as it relates to the trade disputes that are going on between Russia and the United States, I mean, we're just -- we're continuing, as we said in the first quarter, to cooperate fully. There's no news for us to report on that today. The thing that we would have seen in Q2 relative to Q1 was -- one, very much prevalent in a lot of people's results, was just weakening economic conditions within Russia associated with the consumer level; but then also, for brands who've been in the press like some of ours, some hesitancy at the trade level associated with buying and putting into inventory the brands while there's uncertainty around the government's actions. So I think the combination of those. Then you add to it the -- when you look at our reported results, what's happened with the ruble, you get sort of 3 factors influencing what's been going on in the last 90 days in Russia for us. So as we have updates to report on, anything as it relates to the Russian regulatory agencies and how that affects our business, we'll certainly bring those forward to you all.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then just following up on the national expansion of Fire. Any color just in terms of, is there any changes to the approach you're taking here versus Honey, whether it's faster rollout of the national expansion? Given that you've already invested behind the Honey flavor line, is there less investment to be made here? Just any color just in terms of the difference between how you're approaching Fire expansion versus Honey.\n\n---\n\nSure. Let me give you a little background on this. Because it's a -- and we're, of course, number one, by nature conservative on this front because we're dealing with the Jack Daniel's trademark. And I think we're just, as you would expect -- and I hope you would expect that we really want to measure, not just short term, but continue to monitor long term the impact of the these line extensions off of Jack Daniel's. And I think one of the reasons we've largely, over a very long period of time, done it well, is because the conservative approach to it has served -- I mean, it has really served us well. Now having said that, there's this what we think a great opportunity out there for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire associated with what's going on in the -- particularly in the U.S. right now with the flavored whiskey segment. And so I'll just draw a couple of comparisons between Tennessee Fire and Tennessee Honey. One is that Tennessee Honey itself is a brand that today is in excess of 1 million cases, approximates $25 a bottle and is growing in excess of 30%. And so, number one, we just think we want to make sure we keep our eye on that because the statistics I just cited there, those 3 things, are very unusual, to have brands of that size, at that price point, at that growth rate. And so first and foremost, we wanted to make sure and continue to make sure that Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey has every opportunity to realize its full potential. And I'll remind everybody it's in year, I think, 4, 4.5, I guess, of -- maybe in the United States, it would be early ...\n\n---\n\nStarting its fourth.\n\n---\n\nYes, starting its fourth year. So part of this is to not have these things be a flash in the pan and to make sure they're nice, enduring, profitable, growing brands of Brown-Forman. So if you think about that and you approach Tennessee Fire, it being a second line extension in the flavored area, in a short amount of time, we're being cautious. That's why we went and tested it. For Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey, we immediately went to a launch nationally in the United States in a relatively short amount of time. So with this, we wanted to make sure that what we were doing was well received in the consumer marketplace and...\n\n---\n\nAnd understand what it was doing to our own brand.\n\n---\n\nYes, you bet. And understand cannibalization, understand competitive reference, understand how the trade puts the brands into distribution and promotes them. So all these things that are just a little more complicated on the second one. Now the one thing I will say that is really encouraging to us, that has sort of enabled us to go ahead and announce the national rollout is how well it has done in test market. I mean, we've seen exceptionally strong test market results. And of course, we're reading not only what's happening volumetrically in the marketplace with sales and trial and all that, but really also focusing in on brand equity perceptions, doing a couple of ways of research to understand how the consumer is viewing Tennessee Fire. And I will just say, of course, one of the most important things that really points to great opportunity is that there's already a very large player in the cinnamon whiskey market that is both a potential source of volume, but also creates the opportunity for additional entrants. Now the one thing about it is the leader in this case is popular-priced. And we're going in at the premium level, and that's something we accept as a reality. But even with that, one thing that we've learned from the research is that Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire against the marketplace today is seen as having great advantage on really important dimensions, at least they're very important to us, such as taste, premiumness, quality, authenticity, masculinity. So those are the types of things that we look to, to help us make these decisions. So price will always be an inhibitor for some on any product, and we would expect that to be one of the things that we, for any period of time, would be dealing with as it relates to this particular product. But nonetheless, we've been really encouraged by what we've seen. And just remember the other thing. The results of Tennessee Fire in its test markets have been as strong or stronger than what we would have seen for Tennessee Honey in its early days. And what really heartens us is that we really have had no media support behind it to speak of. It's mostly been promotional, some social media and word of mouth and in-store. So as we go national, we think there's an opportunity to build awareness and appeal at a higher level, similar to what we did with Tennessee Honey's launch. So I hope that gives you some background on why we've approached it the way we have. We'll continue to be both enthusiastic and optimistic about it but also appropriately conservative about it.\n\n---\n\nCan you just talk about cash flow in the quarter? I think a lot of it had to do with like the accrued tax liability, but it seems like you had negative cash from operations in the quarter. So can you just tell us if it's timing or something else? And then maybe the outlook for the rest of the year.\n\n---\n\nSure. So if we look at -- you're right, our cash flow was down, I think, about -- as -- cash flow from operations is really the driver. If you look at it, it was down about $130 million from same period last year. And if you think about what drove that, I think -- I like to break it down in a couple of buckets. The first piece is what you would expect. You're going to have a small piece of it just due to just normal seasonality or, in our case, working capital increases because we've got a growing business and we're laying down more whiskey for our expected demand as we get out 3, 4, 5, 6 years from now. So set that aside. The majority of it, as you pointed out, 80% to 85% of it, was due to tax payments. And essentially, really all of it is timing. But let me explain the timing to you a bit. About 40% of that timing will clear itself out in the current fiscal year. And the remaining pieces of onetime in nature, that relates to some restructuring that we did in our European business, that onetime item is really spread over this year, where we had a payment that we made, last year where we got a benefit and next year where we're going to get a small benefit. So those 3 things together, net to the onetime item, is really just timing, if you will. And so when we look at the rest of the year, expect our cash flows to grow year-on-year, if you will. And our forecasts would suggest that as our business grows. So nothing unusual as you look at the rest of the year. I hope that helps you.\n\n---\n\nI guess just a follow-up first on Bill's question. Just -- and I might have missed it, but did you give an update on your capital spending guidance for the year?\n\n---\n\nI did not, but I'll be glad to. We're still projecting somewhere in the $120 million to $140 million range.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then I guess a second question just related to some of the earlier questions you had related to the sales outlook for the balance of the year. And I guess just the one thing, if you could help maybe shape how the environment -- I mean, if you look at all the variables that went into projecting sales over the balance of this year from where we stand today versus sort of where they would have been when the year started, the -- are there more negatives or positives in terms of kind of what you're looking at going forward today versus maybe what you were thinking about at the beginning of the year? And, I mean, I guess as I go through the list in my head, it just seems like Russia and maybe some emerging markets a little bit worse, Germany maybe a touch worse from a macro perspective. But on the other hand, you've seen some positive momentum in terms of some of the actions you've taken in the U.S., and then, of course, we're layering Fire on. So I'm just trying to get a sense, just sort of maybe your confidence in the 6% to 8% now maybe versus where it would have been at the start of the year relative to maybe some of those headwinds and tailwinds.\n\n---\n\nI'll try. I mean, I think, well, the first thing, of course, Bryan, is that we've got 6 months behind us. So -- but I think by nature, you're more confident about 6 months ahead of you versus 12. You always have the holiday season that you in this industry particularly you worry about it. But I think it's about the same. I think you had mentioned most of the -- and I would say they largely offset each other. If I think about my own confidence level, I think U.S. is probably stronger, and it's a big -- it's our #1 country. I would say I feel stronger about it today than I would have back in, say, May or something. And -- but I think you're right to call out Russia and actually the prolonged nature of the excise tax increases in Poland. I would have hoped there would have been a -- the consumer and the trade would have adjusted more rapidly than we've seen them. But again, that gives us some of the confidence in the back half because you'll go against some pretty soft comps in the fourth quarter there particularly. And part of it is, too, this will be a year away from the sort of sticker shock that comes from these excise taxes. So I think you hit it about right. I mean, you have some regional reallocations. But generally, I mean, I kind of said at the beginning, I like -- continue to like the balance of our growth across the globe. And that diversification we have allows us to make adjustments. The other thing is, they're smaller levels, but things like Herradura continuing to do better and the premium products, Woodford Reserve. I mean, if you just look at, over the years, particularly a brand like Woodford Reserve is just getting bigger and bigger. And so something like at that size, it's growing 30%-plus, starts to have an impact. And so I think a lot of it -- we'll, of course, reevaluate this after we see the December results because it's such a big period for us. But we do think we're going to have pretty favorable comps in Q4 for the company generally. And so that gives us a lot of confidence about the range we've provided today.\n\n---\n\nYes. And that perspective on Tennessee Fire was very helpful, Paul. I guess a few questions. Firstly, Jane, the $0.05 you mentioned from FX in the quarter, can you just repeat what that was? It's not going to be recurring here at least as far as you can tell for the second half?\n\n---\n\nSure. The $0.05 that I was referring to was actually the first half, $0.02 of which happened in the first quarter related to a onetime item, intercompany item. The other $0.03 relates to our net current assets, primarily cash, in Europe, by the way, that are denominated in euros and exchanged to U.S. dollars. So it's just the revaluation impact on that. And so this -- again, we have to use today's spot and say, okay, here's what your exposure is. And we've got that all captured, whereas if you look at your transactional aspect of it at today's spot rate, you still have downside relative to the prior year as a result of the spot rate.\n\n---\n\nGot it, great.\n\n---\n\nDoes that help? Yes, so it helps, yes.\n\n---\n\nYes, it does. And that's great. And then on Germany, I -- really a follow-on to Judy's question. You're talking about the fourth quarter benefiting there. Can you speak to takeaway or give us a little more color on why you expect this down performance to reverse in the second half and into next fiscal year?\n\n---\n\nAnd so -- actually, I want to start with Poland. We actually have seen some recent takeaway trends that are showing some positive improvement on both Finlandia and Jack from a takeaway perspective. So they are growing again. So that bodes well for the rest of the year. Plus in that market, as well as Germany, because of the price increases, so there was a large buy-in, in the third quarter in both those markets in advance of price increases on January 1. One was excise tax driven. That was Poland. And the second one was a price increase on -- in the German market on our brands. There was a large buy-in, in the market on both those brands in the third quarter, which resulted in, of course, in Poland the sticker shock. There was a buy-in, in the fourth quarter. So we know we will back -- we'll get back in balance in terms of our inventory levels. And if we see takeaway trends accelerating, we would expect to see our results to have a benefit, not only cycling against a weak comp, where no activity was going on or very little activity was going on, to where we're seeing some growth now.\n\n---\n\nAlso I think in Germany, there -- just the retail activity itself is -- the retailers in that market, I mean, the takeaway trends have been softer this year than they were 1 year ago. And -- but part of that, I think, is associated with, since there are some very large retailers there and a couple have changed -- one in particular has changed their manner in which they price to the consumer, I mean, where you and I might call it one of these sort of everyday low pricing version of that. And that always, I think, takes the marketplace time to adjust to their -- at the consumer level -- time to adjust to new buying patterns as well. So some of those show up in our consumer takeaway numbers, of course. And so I think part of it is just time away from higher prices. As you move from month-to-month or quarter-to-quarter, I think your confidence level raises. And that's beyond the levels of just favorable comps because there was buy-ins and then basically very low sales afterwards. But I do think some of it is really, in the end, one of focus on the consumer level, and we think just time away from those higher places and acclimation to them helps.\n\n---\n\nGot it. And can you speak to order of magnitude, what takeaway rates you're seeing right now in Germany?\n\n---\n\nHang on just a second. We can refer to -- let's see if we've got something we can refer to.\n\n---\n\nYes. So Germany, categories are growing -- whiskey category itself was growing in the mid- to high single digits. And in Poland, whiskey's back growing in high single digits.\n\n---\n\nSo a very good backdrop here once you got these inventory adjustments taken care of. That's great. Okay.\n\n---\n\nYes. And acclimation to prices, yes.\n\n---\n\nThat's great. Okay. And then 2 final ones. One is vodka segment here in the United States heading into the holidays. Anything notable in terms of pricing behavior among the competition? Any changes there? And then finally, capital allocation. You authorized another round of repurchase. You're below 1x EBITDA in terms of leverage. I think you're going to continue to be below 1x when you look out a year absent any deals. Can you just speak to why you're not returning more cash more aggressively to shareholders?\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nWhy we're not returning more cash to shareholders? I think...\n\n---\n\nYes, taking the opportunity to lever up a bit, nothing crazy. But get a little more leverage and return more cash.\n\n---\n\nYes, I mean, we always look at that, as you've seen. I mean, we tend to look at that over much longer periods of time than just what's happening in a particular year or quarter. But, I would certainly say that over the past several years, we've been returning more shareholders than, for example, making acquisitions -- returning more to shareholders than making acquisitions. And of course, that's been a good investment on behalf of the company and the shareholders. But we'll always look at that. I just think that compared to what we've seen out there as the uses of cash, particularly around the acquisition area, it's been pretty thin as it relates to things that we've found attractive and advisable. So -- and that's reflected in sort of the absence of really any acquisitions in some time at the company. On the -- contrast, we've been very successful with innovation. So as companies think through how to win in the marketplace, you always have the opportunity to buy it or to build it. And in the case of the last few years, we've been successful in innovating. Around vodka, I mean, my general comment about that globally is it is brutally competitive right now. I mean, the -- if you think about the large markets for it, you've got Russia, Poland, the United States as being the premier markets. And we've already talked about Russia and Poland quite a bit here. So with excise taxes and people repositioning or innovating to hit lower price points, I mean, it's just very, very competitive, particularly in Poland and Russia. And then I would say over in the United States, I mean, a lot -- it's really been interesting to watch. It's harder to get prices these days. The flavored aspect of the U.S. vodka market has gone soft here in the last couple of years, and the winning brands happen to be coming from -- as was the case 5 years ago, to the established brands -- from upstarts. And so there's -- it's undeniable that Tito's is the sort of leading growth brand. And it's not in the flavored business, it's benefiting from the organic and local, and sort of craft benefit -- there's -- and so one of the lessons that you see over time from vodka is that you -- once you think you have an established brand, because there's very few barriers to entry, particularly in this U.S. market -- you really see new brands come in and capture the imagination of consumers. It's true of both Tito's and this Gallo entrant, New Amsterdam, so.\n\n---\n\nThat's great. And one quick follow-up on that. On the margin here in the U.S., price competition, similar to what it was 3 months ago? What's the dynamic here in the U.S. on price in vodka?\n\n---\n\nOh, it's stable. I mean, tough to get prices, it looks like to me. I think the big dynamic that's influencing growth in vodka right now is the flavors have, in terms of their ability to add to growth versus the prior year, have become soft. And it's always been the case that the ability to get price in whiskey was far greater than it was in vodka in most of the key markets.\n\n---\n\nThis is actually Stephanie on for Bill. Just kind of going off of Judy's question earlier, first in terms of what's going on in Russia. Now is this primarily impacting just the vodka sales? Or is it more broad- based across brands? And then secondly, just on your rollout of Tennessee Fire, are we going to start seeing maybe shipments for like half the country starting in the third quarter, with the majority of the launch in the fourth quarter? Or is it all kind of primarily in 4Q?\n\n---\n\nOn the last question, you should just expect Q4.\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nIt'd be -- it'll be sort of February and beyond for us. And on Russia, the impact, I mean, I'd break it into the consumer impact, because of the weakening Russian economy, would apply to all categories. I mean, it's just really -- it would be difficult -- whatever impacts the consumer will influence their purchasing patterns generally. I mean, overall, the whiskeys in that market tend to be more premium- priced than the vodkas, generally because there's so many local -- important vodka brands in Russia. But the -- as it relates to our company, some of the concerns and risks we've identified through this first half have been more associated with some of the things that have been, in the public side, related to Jack Daniel's and would not have applied as much to Finlandia. So in Finlandia, we would worry more about the competitiveness and the economy in Russia, whereas, on Jack Daniel's, we'd worry about that, we'd worry about also some of these regulatory concerns we've surfaced and, on both of them, of course, for our company, worry about the translation effect of the ruble, so.\n\n---\n\nGot it. That's very helpful. And then just quickly on housekeeping, are you still expecting the 29.5% tax rate for the year? Because I noticed it was just a little bit higher in the second quarter.\n\n---\n\nJust I would pencil in -- just use 30%.\n\n---\n\n30%? Okay.\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nOkay.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Thank you, Paul and Jane. And thanks to all of you for joining us today for our second quarter earnings call. Many of you have already RSVP-ed for our Investor Day on December 10. But for those of you who haven't yet, please feel free to follow up after our call, and we'll make sure you have all the details. Have a great week, and we look forward to seeing you next week in New York. Thanks.\n\n---\n\nThanks.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Vivien Azer (Analysts)】\nSo my first question has to do with the strong acceleration that you saw in the United States, in particular for Jack Daniel's. From time to time, we've discussed potential for a competitive disruption to the brown spirit renaissance from your vodka competitors. So can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing from the competitive stance, in particular from the white spirit players in the market?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nSure. I mean, as I just commented, we were pleased to see this acceleration not only in the results that Jane discussed but also at some of the syndicated data that supports improved consumer takeaway. I mean, as I think about it, there are a couple of things that we might point to. Of course, the category continues to do very, very well, but the category has been doing well for some time. And the jump that we've seen in the Jack Daniel's Black Label trends recently, we think, may be attributable to a couple of factors. One is this year, relative to past, we think we just have improved relative pricing. We had been quite aggressive in the U.S. and consistent over the last couple of years of taking prices. And I think in some places around the country, we got ahead of some of our competitive set and particularly at a time when the consumer might not have had as much disposable income. So you put together the fact that we have improved relative pricing, even though we haven't been like dramatically lowering prices, it's just that others have caught up to us as we've been less aggressive with pricing this year. And you put that together with maybe this benefit that the consumer is seeing from lower fuel prices, which might be giving them better discretionary income, and I think we might be at a sweet spot where it's easier for our consumer, who drinks this on occasion, to trade up more frequently, is maybe the bottom line. And then I would add to it, entering FY '15, we consciously mobilized our U.S. sales and marketing teams in the United States with a renewed focus on the Jack Daniel's Black Label brand. I mean, we -- in some ways, we're -- I would call it asserting our category leadership. I mean, just making sure we weren't taking for granted the fact that Brown-Forman was the leader of the American whiskey business in the United States at a time when it was booming and that, therefore, it made it, of course, more competitive. And I just think in some ways, through either investment, focus, just the heavy reminder of the importance of Jack Daniel's Black Label to Brown-Forman in its home country at a time that's very important for the category has really helped to focus attention promotionally and, from an investment standpoint, to also add to it. So I think the combination of that improved relative pricing, maybe improved posture from the consumer and then our promotional efforts around it may be the primary factors contributing to the uptick.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Vivien Azer (Analysts)】\nThat's very helpful. Can you just remind us what your hedging strategy is, whether today's transactions, translation, a little bit of both? And then to follow up on that, the implications for lapping some of the expense hits that you're seeing right now as you go into '16.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nSure. So just to give you a little background on our hedging philosophy, I think that's what you're asking for, is first of all, we aren't in the market for speculating about FX. We have never done that. And we don't hedge in excess of our underlying net exposures either, and we don't fully hedge our transaction exposures. So in other words, we're not in to take a -- get a 100% mitigated exposure all taken care of or we wouldn't go the other way and have none. So what instead we do, we do something that we call more like you're used to, dollar cost averaging, so that we're -- over any period of time, a 12-month period of time, you would see about 50% of our transactional exposure, if you will, hedged. And so I thought -- while I'm here, I thought I might just spend a little bit more talking about FX because I'm sure there's going to be more color to this. And think about what happened in our first half of the year, the $0.10. And I thought I'm going to spend a minute and break it down a bit more, because what I was just referring to largely centered around our transactional exposure. And our transactional exposure I'm referring to is really our business, our ongoing business or our sales of our product less the expenses to sell those products, so our people, our advertising and spending that we would do in foreign currency as well as any cost that might be incurred in a local market. And so when I look at that $0.10 that we had hurt our results in the first half, about half of it was due to that and that -- and was -- if you looked at the currency shifts, as I said early on, how much they moved in just a couple of months' period of time, it was pretty dramatic. The other half of it -- but it worked as we planned in terms of how we hedge and what we would have been expecting in terms of our net exposure. The other half of it is what I was referring to that shows up on the other income and expense line item, and it is referred to as our net assets, largely cash in this case. And I think I referred to in the first quarter, we had -- so out of that other $0.05 hit we had a like $0.02 hit in the first quarter that was onetime in nature that related to an intercompany transaction. The remaining $0.03 was really driven by the revaluation of cash balances that we have, growing cash balances that would become bigger overseas. So when I look ahead and think about what to expect for the rest of the year, this piece that I'm talking about, the $0.05 piece I'm talking about, I would say that, that is done and behind us. It's the transactional piece that you still have exposure on, meaning at today's spot rates and you compare to what we're looking to do for the rest of the year compared to those spot rates, you've got downside. And that's where the $0.05 was coming from. So when you think about the FX and how much is ongoing versus how much is onetime in nature, I would split them in 2 pieces and then think of the rest of this year as $0.05. You're right in terms of the following year. Until we start lapping these rates, you'll still have some downside in F '16. So...\n\n---\n\n【質問: Vivien Azer (Analysts)】\nThat's -- exactly. That's very helpful. My last question has to do on Australia. I think recently, Diageo announced that they had reduced the ADD [ph] on some of their ready-to-drink products. I know that's a big ready-to-drink market for you guys as well. Have you guys made any adjustments to your ADD [ph]?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nYes. And so Vivien, that's something that we constantly look at. We're looking at our proof and consumers and what they're looking for and what they see in the products and what they're wanting in our products all the time. We actually are currently, and have been for a number of years -- the SoCo RTDs, our Southern Comfort RTDs, in that market have been at that rate that Diageo was lowering their Smirnoff down to and Captain Morgan -- they did some time ago -- we're already there. And so -- but we don't have any plans for our premium Jack Daniel's RTDs, to reduce them to those rates at this time. But it's an ongoing thing that we always look at and consider the consumers while we're at it. It's interesting to note, we do have an RTD, that we do have at a lower proof than even the Diageo one. And it's more for special events, like your camps and mining and different things like that where the alcohol products are allowed to be sold, but at a much lower rate. So -- but no plans right now.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nAnd I'll tell you -- I will add that, that move by Diageo is, I suspect, a direct reflection of them trying to remain competitive given what's been going on in that country with what I consider to be excessive excise taxation. And so one of the tools available to any of the brand owners is to reformulate in order to make the products to continue to be affordable and attractive to consumers. So you do end up having a trade-off between alcohol content and price. And so their move, in my view, is understandable.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nYes, absolutely.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Nik Modi (Analysts)】\nYes. Just a couple of quick questions for me. On the pricing, you had a -- it looked like a real nice result. Just I was wondering if you can break it down for us in terms of rate and mix. And just provide some context around that. And then the second and third questions, just quickly, are you guys doing Jack -- Winter Jack this season? I usually buy for Thanksgiving. I didn't see it in the stores. So just curious if you guys are going to have that back out there as we think about comparisons versus 1 year ago. And then just the last question is, the guidance really looks like it's implying a nice acceleration in the back half of the year. And if Jack Fire is not really the --  going to be a big driver of that, I'm just curious on what will be the driver.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nYes. By the way, where do you live? We're going to make sure that in your liquor stores, we've got Jack Daniel's Winter Jack.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nIt will be available, yes, right.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nIt should be, yes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nMaybe it was sold out.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nYes, there you go. But yes, we are planning on selling it. In terms of the -- of pricing, recall at the beginning of the year when we communicated that, and I think we're very much on track to deliver this price/mix that we've been talking about. But we took very -- Paul already alluded to it. After 2 years of really hefty, strong pricing in the U.S. in 4% to 5% range, 2 consecutive years of those rates, we chose in the U.S. to moderate, take time out, get some of the competitors to catch up from a relative perspective. And so it's very low, about a percent is all we were planning. But we were still planning pricing outside the U.S. And so we are still seeing pricing coming in from -- coming from outside of the U.S. And we're expecting, I believe, when we talked about this early on, that we were expecting about 1/3 of our growth in net sales to come from pricing for the year. So I think we're still on target on that. And then your question in terms of the acceleration on the back half of the year, I think one of the things you have to think about is what happened in the first quarter. We -- there was only a 3% growth rate in the first quarter. We had tough comps in the first quarter. We talked to what was going on. It was largely retail inventory, if you will, and we adjusted for that, and we come along -- we knew we were going to get an acceleration in the second quarter. We grew 7% in the second quarter. I don't expect that 7% to slow down for the balance of the year. So -- in fact, when we get to our fourth quarter, we had a pretty weak fourth quarter in a couple of markets. Particularly, we've been talking about for some time in Poland and Germany, and we're expecting a rebound in both of those places. They had some buy-ins in their third quarter of last year. And so that -- we're not even including Fire in that. These are the things that we're talking about that will give us a lift in our sales growth, so.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nAlong with the U.S. acceleration that we've been seeing. I mean, I think that...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nAnd the U.S. [indiscernible].\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nWe're certainly dependent on that continued performance in the U.S. from Jack Daniel's Black Label as one of the contributing factors, whereas -- again, it was another piece of the business that...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nWas slower.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nWas slower in the first quarter than it will be through the remainder of the 9 months. So when you think about key markets in Europe and you think about the U.S. and then focus on the results for second quarter and think about that over the remainder of the second half, it can account for the kind of guidance we're giving you.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nYes, exactly. And back on your question on Fire, though. Again, just to reiterate what we said in terms of the timing of this, this is a late fiscal year introduction. The time that it's going to take to get into the system from a distribution, and really for the consumer to start pulling in and so forth like that, we really are -- we've written down ...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nVery modest.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nVery, very minimal, if any, a very small amount in the forecast. And then we know there will be a pipeline. So our reported results will get some benefit from that at the top. By the time you get to the bottom, it's minimal, too, because we want to introduce this brand in the best way we can and, to be successful, invest -- we're investing a lot to support the launch.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Judy Hong (Analysts)】\nI had a couple of questions, really more around your markets outside the U.S. So first, maybe just touch on the U.K. and Germany related to, number one, if all of the trade inventory volatility, if that's behind us now, so we see more normalized buying patterns going forward. And then if you strip out the inventory movement, what are you really seeing from an underlying perspective? And then the second question is really related to Russia. I know it's only 2% of your business, but clearly a pretty volatile situation. So how much of risk are you factoring in as you look out for the next 6 months, 12 months? And what are you -- what have you noticed so far just in terms of your trends in that market?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nLots of questions. Great, Judy. Yes, in terms of the -- what we're seeing in the markets outside the U.S., particularly you're focusing on the U.K. and Germany and those were the 2 markets we called out in our first quarter outside the U.S. that were having some disruptions in trade inventory adjustments. The U.K. is back in balance. So in our numbers, they had a great second quarter, and they're back in balance. They're growing half single digits year-to-date.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nDid very well in Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey, too.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nAbsolutely. Thanks, Paul. And then Germany is still going through a period of, I would call it buying disruptions, if you will. It's an interesting market right now. The economy is pretty difficult. We have set for ourselves a -- what we believe is the right strategy as it relates to the price positioning of our brands. The retail market there, as you can imagine, is very challenged with the economy and looking to take prices down. And so we continue to work through this situation with them, with our retail partners in that market. But we have not worked through all that yet. So as I've noted in our script today, we still have a little bit of hangover, if you will, from retail adjustments in the U.S. and in Germany. And so if we take in consideration -- those are the 2 primary markets left that we have that occurring in. If you take the 5.5% underlying growth that we reported this morning and adjust for these 2 things, you're over 6% underlying growth.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nOkay.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Judy Hong (Analysts)】\nGot it, okay. And then...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nYou had 2 questions. Oh, yes, the Russian.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Judy Hong (Analysts)】\nYes, and Russia, yes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nI think on Russia, Jane alluded to it a bit in her comments. But I think the thing that we're focused on, I mean, it's a place where of course, as it relates to any relevance for our company as it relates to the trade disputes that are going on between Russia and the United States, I mean, we're just -- we're continuing, as we said in the first quarter, to cooperate fully. There's no news for us to report on that today. The thing that we would have seen in Q2 relative to Q1 was -- one, very much prevalent in a lot of people's results, was just weakening economic conditions within Russia associated with the consumer level; but then also, for brands who've been in the press like some of ours, some hesitancy at the trade level associated with buying and putting into inventory the brands while there's uncertainty around the government's actions. So I think the combination of those. Then you add to it the -- when you look at our reported results, what's happened with the ruble, you get sort of 3 factors influencing what's been going on in the last 90 days in Russia for us. So as we have updates to report on, anything as it relates to the Russian regulatory agencies and how that affects our business, we'll certainly bring those forward to you all.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Judy Hong (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then just following up on the national expansion of Fire. Any color just in terms of, is there any changes to the approach you're taking here versus Honey, whether it's faster rollout of the national expansion? Given that you've already invested behind the Honey flavor line, is there less investment to be made here? Just any color just in terms of the difference between how you're approaching Fire expansion versus Honey.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nSure. Let me give you a little background on this. Because it's a -- and we're, of course, number one, by nature conservative on this front because we're dealing with the Jack Daniel's trademark. And I think we're just, as you would expect -- and I hope you would expect that we really want to measure, not just short term, but continue to monitor long term the impact of the these line extensions off of Jack Daniel's. And I think one of the reasons we've largely, over a very long period of time, done it well, is because the conservative approach to it has served -- I mean, it has really served us well. Now having said that, there's this what we think a great opportunity out there for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire associated with what's going on in the -- particularly in the U.S. right now with the flavored whiskey segment. And so I'll just draw a couple of comparisons between Tennessee Fire and Tennessee Honey. One is that Tennessee Honey itself is a brand that today is in excess of 1 million cases, approximates $25 a bottle and is growing in excess of 30%. And so, number one, we just think we want to make sure we keep our eye on that because the statistics I just cited there, those 3 things, are very unusual, to have brands of that size, at that price point, at that growth rate. And so first and foremost, we wanted to make sure and continue to make sure that Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey has every opportunity to realize its full potential. And I'll remind everybody it's in year, I think, 4, 4.5, I guess, of -- maybe in the United States, it would be early ...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nStarting its fourth.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nYes, starting its fourth year. So part of this is to not have these things be a flash in the pan and to make sure they're nice, enduring, profitable, growing brands of Brown-Forman. So if you think about that and you approach Tennessee Fire, it being a second line extension in the flavored area, in a short amount of time, we're being cautious. That's why we went and tested it. For Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey, we immediately went to a launch nationally in the United States in a relatively short amount of time. So with this, we wanted to make sure that what we were doing was well received in the consumer marketplace and...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nAnd understand what it was doing to our own brand.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nYes, you bet. And understand cannibalization, understand competitive reference, understand how the trade puts the brands into distribution and promotes them. So all these things that are just a little more complicated on the second one. Now the one thing I will say that is really encouraging to us, that has sort of enabled us to go ahead and announce the national rollout is how well it has done in test market. I mean, we've seen exceptionally strong test market results. And of course, we're reading not only what's happening volumetrically in the marketplace with sales and trial and all that, but really also focusing in on brand equity perceptions, doing a couple of ways of research to understand how the consumer is viewing Tennessee Fire. And I will just say, of course, one of the most important things that really points to great opportunity is that there's already a very large player in the cinnamon whiskey market that is both a potential source of volume, but also creates the opportunity for additional entrants. Now the one thing about it is the leader in this case is popular-priced. And we're going in at the premium level, and that's something we accept as a reality. But even with that, one thing that we've learned from the research is that Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire against the marketplace today is seen as having great advantage on really important dimensions, at least they're very important to us, such as taste, premiumness, quality, authenticity, masculinity. So those are the types of things that we look to, to help us make these decisions. So price will always be an inhibitor for some on any product, and we would expect that to be one of the things that we, for any period of time, would be dealing with as it relates to this particular product. But nonetheless, we've been really encouraged by what we've seen. And just remember the other thing. The results of Tennessee Fire in its test markets have been as strong or stronger than what we would have seen for Tennessee Honey in its early days. And what really heartens us is that we really have had no media support behind it to speak of. It's mostly been promotional, some social media and word of mouth and in-store. So as we go national, we think there's an opportunity to build awareness and appeal at a higher level, similar to what we did with Tennessee Honey's launch. So I hope that gives you some background on why we've approached it the way we have. We'll continue to be both enthusiastic and optimistic about it but also appropriately conservative about it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: William Schmitz (Analysts)】\nCan you just talk about cash flow in the quarter? I think a lot of it had to do with like the accrued tax liability, but it seems like you had negative cash from operations in the quarter. So can you just tell us if it's timing or something else? And then maybe the outlook for the rest of the year.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nSure. So if we look at -- you're right, our cash flow was down, I think, about -- as -- cash flow from operations is really the driver. If you look at it, it was down about $130 million from same period last year. And if you think about what drove that, I think -- I like to break it down in a couple of buckets. The first piece is what you would expect. You're going to have a small piece of it just due to just normal seasonality or, in our case, working capital increases because we've got a growing business and we're laying down more whiskey for our expected demand as we get out 3, 4, 5, 6 years from now. So set that aside. The majority of it, as you pointed out, 80% to 85% of it, was due to tax payments. And essentially, really all of it is timing. But let me explain the timing to you a bit. About 40% of that timing will clear itself out in the current fiscal year. And the remaining pieces of onetime in nature, that relates to some restructuring that we did in our European business, that onetime item is really spread over this year, where we had a payment that we made, last year where we got a benefit and next year where we're going to get a small benefit. So those 3 things together, net to the onetime item, is really just timing, if you will. And so when we look at the rest of the year, expect our cash flows to grow year-on-year, if you will. And our forecasts would suggest that as our business grows. So nothing unusual as you look at the rest of the year. I hope that helps you.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Bryan Spillane (Analysts)】\nI guess just a follow-up first on Bill's question. Just -- and I might have missed it, but did you give an update on your capital spending guidance for the year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nI did not, but I'll be glad to. We're still projecting somewhere in the $120 million to $140 million range.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Bryan Spillane (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then I guess a second question just related to some of the earlier questions you had related to the sales outlook for the balance of the year. And I guess just the one thing, if you could help maybe shape how the environment -- I mean, if you look at all the variables that went into projecting sales over the balance of this year from where we stand today versus sort of where they would have been when the year started, the -- are there more negatives or positives in terms of kind of what you're looking at going forward today versus maybe what you were thinking about at the beginning of the year? And, I mean, I guess as I go through the list in my head, it just seems like Russia and maybe some emerging markets a little bit worse, Germany maybe a touch worse from a macro perspective. But on the other hand, you've seen some positive momentum in terms of some of the actions you've taken in the U.S., and then, of course, we're layering Fire on. So I'm just trying to get a sense, just sort of maybe your confidence in the 6% to 8% now maybe versus where it would have been at the start of the year relative to maybe some of those headwinds and tailwinds.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nI'll try. I mean, I think, well, the first thing, of course, Bryan, is that we've got 6 months behind us. So -- but I think by nature, you're more confident about 6 months ahead of you versus 12. You always have the holiday season that you in this industry particularly you worry about it. But I think it's about the same. I think you had mentioned most of the -- and I would say they largely offset each other. If I think about my own confidence level, I think U.S. is probably stronger, and it's a big -- it's our #1 country. I would say I feel stronger about it today than I would have back in, say, May or something. And -- but I think you're right to call out Russia and actually the prolonged nature of the excise tax increases in Poland. I would have hoped there would have been a -- the consumer and the trade would have adjusted more rapidly than we've seen them. But again, that gives us some of the confidence in the back half because you'll go against some pretty soft comps in the fourth quarter there particularly. And part of it is, too, this will be a year away from the sort of sticker shock that comes from these excise taxes. So I think you hit it about right. I mean, you have some regional reallocations. But generally, I mean, I kind of said at the beginning, I like -- continue to like the balance of our growth across the globe. And that diversification we have allows us to make adjustments. The other thing is, they're smaller levels, but things like Herradura continuing to do better and the premium products, Woodford Reserve. I mean, if you just look at, over the years, particularly a brand like Woodford Reserve is just getting bigger and bigger. And so something like at that size, it's growing 30%-plus, starts to have an impact. And so I think a lot of it -- we'll, of course, reevaluate this after we see the December results because it's such a big period for us. But we do think we're going to have pretty favorable comps in Q4 for the company generally. And so that gives us a lot of confidence about the range we've provided today.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Swartzberg (Analysts)】\nYes. And that perspective on Tennessee Fire was very helpful, Paul. I guess a few questions. Firstly, Jane, the $0.05 you mentioned from FX in the quarter, can you just repeat what that was? It's not going to be recurring here at least as far as you can tell for the second half?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nSure. The $0.05 that I was referring to was actually the first half, $0.02 of which happened in the first quarter related to a onetime item, intercompany item. The other $0.03 relates to our net current assets, primarily cash, in Europe, by the way, that are denominated in euros and exchanged to U.S. dollars. So it's just the revaluation impact on that. And so this -- again, we have to use today's spot and say, okay, here's what your exposure is. And we've got that all captured, whereas if you look at your transactional aspect of it at today's spot rate, you still have downside relative to the prior year as a result of the spot rate.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Swartzberg (Analysts)】\nGot it, great.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nDoes that help? Yes, so it helps, yes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Swartzberg (Analysts)】\nYes, it does. And that's great. And then on Germany, I -- really a follow-on to Judy's question. You're talking about the fourth quarter benefiting there. Can you speak to takeaway or give us a little more color on why you expect this down performance to reverse in the second half and into next fiscal year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nAnd so -- actually, I want to start with Poland. We actually have seen some recent takeaway trends that are showing some positive improvement on both Finlandia and Jack from a takeaway perspective. So they are growing again. So that bodes well for the rest of the year. Plus in that market, as well as Germany, because of the price increases, so there was a large buy-in, in the third quarter in both those markets in advance of price increases on January 1. One was excise tax driven. That was Poland. And the second one was a price increase on -- in the German market on our brands. There was a large buy-in, in the market on both those brands in the third quarter, which resulted in, of course, in Poland the sticker shock. There was a buy-in, in the fourth quarter. So we know we will back -- we'll get back in balance in terms of our inventory levels. And if we see takeaway trends accelerating, we would expect to see our results to have a benefit, not only cycling against a weak comp, where no activity was going on or very little activity was going on, to where we're seeing some growth now.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nAlso I think in Germany, there -- just the retail activity itself is -- the retailers in that market, I mean, the takeaway trends have been softer this year than they were 1 year ago. And -- but part of that, I think, is associated with, since there are some very large retailers there and a couple have changed -- one in particular has changed their manner in which they price to the consumer, I mean, where you and I might call it one of these sort of everyday low pricing version of that. And that always, I think, takes the marketplace time to adjust to their -- at the consumer level -- time to adjust to new buying patterns as well. So some of those show up in our consumer takeaway numbers, of course. And so I think part of it is just time away from higher prices. As you move from month-to-month or quarter-to-quarter, I think your confidence level raises. And that's beyond the levels of just favorable comps because there was buy-ins and then basically very low sales afterwards. But I do think some of it is really, in the end, one of focus on the consumer level, and we think just time away from those higher places and acclimation to them helps.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Swartzberg (Analysts)】\nGot it. And can you speak to order of magnitude, what takeaway rates you're seeing right now in Germany?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nHang on just a second. We can refer to -- let's see if we've got something we can refer to.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nYes. So Germany, categories are growing -- whiskey category itself was growing in the mid- to high single digits. And in Poland, whiskey's back growing in high single digits.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Swartzberg (Analysts)】\nSo a very good backdrop here once you got these inventory adjustments taken care of. That's great. Okay.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nYes. And acclimation to prices, yes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Swartzberg (Analysts)】\nThat's great. Okay. And then 2 final ones. One is vodka segment here in the United States heading into the holidays. Anything notable in terms of pricing behavior among the competition? Any changes there? And then finally, capital allocation. You authorized another round of repurchase. You're below 1x EBITDA in terms of leverage. I think you're going to continue to be below 1x when you look out a year absent any deals. Can you just speak to why you're not returning more cash more aggressively to shareholders?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nWhy we're not returning more cash to shareholders? I think...\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Swartzberg (Analysts)】\nYes, taking the opportunity to lever up a bit, nothing crazy. But get a little more leverage and return more cash.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nYes, I mean, we always look at that, as you've seen. I mean, we tend to look at that over much longer periods of time than just what's happening in a particular year or quarter. But, I would certainly say that over the past several years, we've been returning more shareholders than, for example, making acquisitions -- returning more to shareholders than making acquisitions. And of course, that's been a good investment on behalf of the company and the shareholders. But we'll always look at that. I just think that compared to what we've seen out there as the uses of cash, particularly around the acquisition area, it's been pretty thin as it relates to things that we've found attractive and advisable. So -- and that's reflected in sort of the absence of really any acquisitions in some time at the company. On the -- contrast, we've been very successful with innovation. So as companies think through how to win in the marketplace, you always have the opportunity to buy it or to build it. And in the case of the last few years, we've been successful in innovating. Around vodka, I mean, my general comment about that globally is it is brutally competitive right now. I mean, the -- if you think about the large markets for it, you've got Russia, Poland, the United States as being the premier markets. And we've already talked about Russia and Poland quite a bit here. So with excise taxes and people repositioning or innovating to hit lower price points, I mean, it's just very, very competitive, particularly in Poland and Russia. And then I would say over in the United States, I mean, a lot -- it's really been interesting to watch. It's harder to get prices these days. The flavored aspect of the U.S. vodka market has gone soft here in the last couple of years, and the winning brands happen to be coming from -- as was the case 5 years ago, to the established brands -- from upstarts. And so there's -- it's undeniable that Tito's is the sort of leading growth brand. And it's not in the flavored business, it's benefiting from the organic and local, and sort of craft benefit -- there's -- and so one of the lessons that you see over time from vodka is that you -- once you think you have an established brand, because there's very few barriers to entry, particularly in this U.S. market -- you really see new brands come in and capture the imagination of consumers. It's true of both Tito's and this Gallo entrant, New Amsterdam, so.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Swartzberg (Analysts)】\nThat's great. And one quick follow-up on that. On the margin here in the U.S., price competition, similar to what it was 3 months ago? What's the dynamic here in the U.S. on price in vodka?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nOh, it's stable. I mean, tough to get prices, it looks like to me. I think the big dynamic that's influencing growth in vodka right now is the flavors have, in terms of their ability to add to growth versus the prior year, have become soft. And it's always been the case that the ability to get price in whiskey was far greater than it was in vodka in most of the key markets.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Stephanie Benjamin (Analysts)】\nThis is actually Stephanie on for Bill. Just kind of going off of Judy's question earlier, first in terms of what's going on in Russia. Now is this primarily impacting just the vodka sales? Or is it more broad- based across brands? And then secondly, just on your rollout of Tennessee Fire, are we going to start seeing maybe shipments for like half the country starting in the third quarter, with the majority of the launch in the fourth quarter? Or is it all kind of primarily in 4Q?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nOn the last question, you should just expect Q4.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nIt'd be -- it'll be sort of February and beyond for us. And on Russia, the impact, I mean, I'd break it into the consumer impact, because of the weakening Russian economy, would apply to all categories. I mean, it's just really -- it would be difficult -- whatever impacts the consumer will influence their purchasing patterns generally. I mean, overall, the whiskeys in that market tend to be more premium- priced than the vodkas, generally because there's so many local -- important vodka brands in Russia. But the -- as it relates to our company, some of the concerns and risks we've identified through this first half have been more associated with some of the things that have been, in the public side, related to Jack Daniel's and would not have applied as much to Finlandia. So in Finlandia, we would worry more about the competitiveness and the economy in Russia, whereas, on Jack Daniel's, we'd worry about that, we'd worry about also some of these regulatory concerns we've surfaced and, on both of them, of course, for our company, worry about the translation effect of the ruble, so.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Stephanie Benjamin (Analysts)】\nGot it. That's very helpful. And then just quickly on housekeeping, are you still expecting the 29.5% tax rate for the year? Because I noticed it was just a little bit higher in the second quarter.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nJust I would pencil in -- just use 30%.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Stephanie Benjamin (Analysts)】\n30%? Okay.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nOkay.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jason Koval (Executives)】\nOkay. Thank you, Paul and Jane. And thanks to all of you for joining us today for our second quarter earnings call. Many of you have already RSVP-ed for our Investor Day on December 10. But for those of you who haven't yet, please feel free to follow up after our call, and we'll make sure you have all the details. Have a great week, and we look forward to seeing you next week in New York. Thanks.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nThanks.",

      "transcript_text1": "Good morning, and thank you for joining us. This morning, CIBC's senior executives will review CIBC's Q4 2014 results that were released earlier today.\r\nThe documents referenced on this call including CIBC's Q4 news release, investor presentation and financial supplement, as well as CIBC's annual report, can all be found on our website at www.cibc.com. In addition, an archive of this audio webcast will be available on our website later today.\r\nThis morning's agenda will include opening remarks from Victor Dodig, CIBC's President and Chief Executive Officer. Kevin Glass, our Chief Financial Officer, will follow with a financial review. And Laura Dottori-Attanasio, our Chief Risk Officer, will close the formal remarks with a risk management update. After the presentations, there will be a question-and-answer period that will conclude by 9 a.m.  Also with us for the question-and-answer period are CIBC's business leaders, including Geoff Belsher, Harry Culham, Steve Geist and David Williamson as well as other senior officers.\r\nBefore we begin, let me remind you that any individual speaking on behalf of CIBC on today's call may make forward-looking statements that are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. These statements may include material factors or assumptions that could cause CIBC's actual results in future periods to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the note about forward-looking statements in today's press release.\r\nWith that, let me now turn the meeting over to Victor.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Geoff. And good morning, everyone.\r\nThis morning, CIBC reported a strong finish to 2014, with all of our businesses delivering solid results. Adjusted net income was $3.7 billion, up 2% over 2013. And earnings per share were $8.94, an increase of 3% over last year. We delivered a return on equity of over 20% and maintained a strong Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 10.3%. In fiscal 2014, CIBC returned approximately 60% of capital generated by earnings to our shareholders while maintaining capital ratios that are amongst the highest in the industry.\r\nWe achieved these results by staying on our stated strategy of deepening client relationships and investing in our core businesses. Looking forward, our priority is to build further strength in our businesses by focusing on our culture, our clients and our shareholders. We are committed to continuing on our path of delivering consistent, sustainable earnings and to growing our bank both organically and through targeted strategic acquisitions.\r\nDuring 2014, we delivered several notable accomplishments. In Retail and Business Banking, we continue to be a leader in innovation, being the first Canadian bank to offer check deposits using smartphones. To date, over 2 million checks have been deposited by our clients using CIBC's eDeposit app. We released a new credit card with a unique 2-button technology that combines credit and rewards functionality with our Double Double card, in partnership with Tim Hortons and Visa. In addition to this innovative card, our Aventura travel rewards card has been a big hit with our clients.\r\nWe have also made a substantial investment in technology in our retail branch channel to improve productivity and customer service, to deepen client relationships and to promote cross-selling. In 2014, we completed a national rollout of the first phase of a new branch-based technology platform that enables our advisers to strengthen and deepen relationships with new and existing clients. We've named the new platform COMPASS because it directs clients to what's most appropriate for them to meet their financial needs. It's early days, but feedback on this new platform has been very encouraging. Our advisers find it easy to use, and the average time taken to sell 5 CIBC products and services has been cut in half from 1 hour to 0.5 hours. In 2015, we will continue to invest in our infrastructure and to evolve our culture to be a more client-focused organization. As well, we will improve our processes to make it easier to bank with us and leverage our data to offer a differentiated and personalized experience to our clients. My colleague David Williamson is here this morning to answer questions about Retail and Business Banking.\r\nOur wholesale bank has also done very well over the last number of years, delivering consistent earnings to our shareholders. It's a high-quality franchise with a very competent team that deploys capital in a prudent manner, something we will continue to do. We have leading expertise in the energy, mining, infrastructure and real estate finance sectors. We are also key market participants in transacting foreign exchange, fixed income and commodities. Our strategy is to leverage our industry expertise and client relationships in Canada and to deepen our global presence by supporting our clients when they make investments outside of Canada.\r\nWe continue to be highly ranked by third parties in our capital markets in corporate and investment banking activities, where we have received the following awards: #1 IPO underwriter in Canada; the leader in Canadian equity trading by volume, value and number of trades; the #1 bank in Canadian syndicated loan market by value and number of deals led; and being named the Canadian derivatives house of the year at the 2014 global capital markets -- GlobalCapital Americas Derivatives Awards. My colleagues Harry Culham and Geoff Belsher, our Co-heads of Wholesale Banking, are here this morning to answer questions.\r\nCIBC also has a strong Wealth Management franchise in Canada. CIBC asset management crossed a milestone in 2014 when our assets under management exceeded $100 billion for the first time. As well, we reported the 23rd consecutive quarter of positive net flows of long-term mutual funds in our fourth quarter. We will continue to enhance the client experience and attract new clients in Canada. But with our Canadian business' scale, we will also seek to grow outside of our home market.\r\nWe will look at investments that are in natural progression for CIBC. They will be in businesses that we understand at home and businesses with an industry structure in a market that we like and where we believe we can create shareholder value. We understand private banking and Wealth Management, including asset management, very well. And we've identified the U.S. to be a particularly attractive market for us to pursue. Not only are the U.S. private banking and Wealth Management markets substantially larger than in Canada, but they're also highly fragmented. To date, as you know, we've made 2 foundational investments in U.S. Wealth Management, and both have performed very well.\r\nOur recent acquisition of Atlantic Trust, an award-winning private wealth management firm, closed in early 2014. We retained 99.6% of our client assets and 100% of our team. Assets have grown from USD 20 billion at the time of our investment to over USD 26 billion today. Our plan for Atlantic Trust is to expand our reach across the U.S. beyond the 12 offices we currently have. We're looking at other states where we don't have a presence, and we are actively recruiting highly qualified, experienced professionals to support our client growth.\r\nAs you know, in 2011, we acquired a 40% interest in American Century, a U.S.-based asset manager. It has been a very good investment for us. Assets have grown from USD 111 billion at the time of our investment to over USD 145 billion today, and American Century now manages over $5 billion of CIBC's investment products in Canada. We have a very strong relationship with the management team there, and we believe it's a platform that can continue to grow both organically and through strategic acquisitions. My colleague Steve Geist, our Head of Wealth Management, is here to answer questions this morning as well.\r\nSo looking to 2015 and beyond, our goal at CIBC is clear, and we'll build directly on everything we've accomplished over the past several years. The goal is to be a strong relationship-based and high-performing bank that will to -- continue to deliver consistent and sustainable earnings and create significant shareholder value over time. CIBC is moving from a low-risk bank focused on operational stability to a bank focused on sustainable growth with sound risk management and long-lasting client relationships. We have a strategic plan focused on growth in Canada and select international markets. We're growing from a strong base, and we'll continue to make investments in our people and in our technology to allow us to better meet the needs of our clients.\r\nBefore I turn the meeting over to Kevin Glass to review our financial results, on behalf of CIBC's executive committee and our board, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our shareholders for their continued support and all of CIBC's 44,000 employees for their ongoing dedication to serving our 11 million clients.\r\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Kevin.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Victor.\r\nSo my presentation will refer to the slides that are posted on our website, starting with Slide 6, which is a summary of results for the quarter.\r\nSo we've repeated our strong fourth quarter results and a solid contribution from all of our business lines. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $911 million, which resulted in adjusted earnings per share of $2.24.\r\nIn our Retail and Business Banking segment, strong volume growth in core products drove solid results. Strong revenue in Wealth Management was driven by asset growth due to favorable market conditions as well as record net sales of long-term mutual funds. We are also very pleased with the performance of our U.S.-based businesses Atlantic Trust and American Century Investments.\r\nAnd notwithstanding a challenging environment, Wholesale Banking produced another quarter of solid results, executing on our client-focused strategy. Credit performance also continued to be favorable. And we increased our quarterly dividend by $0.03 per share this quarter.\r\nWe had a few items of note during the quarter, the more material ones being a charge relating to the incorporation of funding valuation adjustments, or FVA, into the valuation of uncollateralized derivatives of $0.21 per share and expenses relating to the development of our enhanced travel rewards program and in respect of the Aeroplan transactions of $0.03 per share. So this is the last quarter that we will be highlighting these expenses as an item of note. In aggregate, the impact of the items of note on our earnings netted to a negative $0.26 per share. The balance of my presentation will be focused on adjusted results, which exclude these items of note, but we've included a slide with reported results in the appendix to this presentation.\r\nSo moving to the details for each of our strategic business units, I'll start with the results for Retail and Business Banking on Slide 7, where revenue for the quarter was $2.1 billion, down 1% from last year, which was due to the impact of the Aero credit card transaction in Q1. Excluding this impact, revenue was actually up 4%.\r\nLooking at our individual lines of business. Revenue in personal banking was $1.6 billion, up 5% compared with last year. Performance benefited from volume growth across CIBC brand products, including a higher fee revenue on strong mutual fund sales.\r\nCIBC brand mortgage balances grew 14% or 12% excluding the benefit from FirstLine conversions. The conversion of FirstLine mortgages into CIBC brand continues to go very well. Since we stopped originating broker mortgages in the FirstLine channel in July of 2012, $31 billion or 65% of the portfolio has run off. Of that amount, we have retained approximately 50% into our own brand mortgage portfolio. We're optimistic that we will continue to maintain current retention levels as the balance of the portfolio runs off.\r\nPersonal deposits were up 6%, and mutual funds were up 17% year-over-year on strong net sales of $5 billion.\r\nBusiness banking revenue was $393 million, the highest revenue on record and up 2% from last year due to volume growth. This was partially offset by the impact of lower spreads. Business lending balances were up 7%, and business deposits and GIC balances were up 9% year-over-year.\r\nThe other segment had revenue of $27 million, which was down $119 million compared to last year, due mainly to the impact of the Aero transaction.\r\nThe provision for credit losses was $171 million, down 20% on a year-over-year basis. The decrease was due to lower write-offs and bankruptcies in the cards portfolio, the impact of an initiative to enhance account management practices as well as the sold Aero balances. We also had losses -- we also had lower losses in the business lending portfolio, which again performed well this quarter.\r\nNoninterest expenses were $1.1 billion, up 3% from the prior year, primarily driven by our continued investment in growth initiatives, including expanding our sales force as well as new product launches and innovations in mobile banking.\r\nNet income was down 3% from the prior year quarter. Excluding the impact of the Aero transaction, net income was actually up 7% year-over-year. Net interest margin, or NIMs, were largely stable, down 1% -- down 1 basis point sequentially.\r\nTurning now to Slide 8. Wealth Management had a strong quarter, with double-digit revenue growth across all businesses. Client assets grew 27% from last year or 12% excluding the recently acquired Atlantic Trust businesses -- business. Revenue was $587 million, up $115 million or 24% from the prior year, with solid performances from all business lines. Retail brokerage revenue of $302 million was up $30 million or 11% compared with the prior year due to higher fee-based revenue.\r\nAsset management revenue of $206 million was up $39 million or 23% from last year. This was largely due to a combination of higher client assets under management driven by market appreciation and strong net sales of long-term mutual funds, as well as a higher contribution from our investment in American Century Investments. This represents the 23rd consecutive quarter of positive net sales of long-term mutual funds, with CIBC Asset Management achieving a record $5.4 billion in long-term net sales in fiscal 2014.\r\nPrivate wealth management revenue of $79 million was up $46 million, mainly from the acquisition of Atlantic Trust.\r\nNoninterest expenses of $424 million were up $89 million or 27% from the prior year, mainly as a result of the inclusion of Atlantic Trust as well as higher performance-based compensation.\r\nNet income in Wealth Management was $124 million, up $19 million or 18% from the same quarter last year.\r\nSlide 9 reflects the results of Wholesale Banking, where we delivered another quarter of strong earnings. Revenue was $577 million, up $39 million or 7% compared with the prior year.\r\nCapital markets revenue of $308 million was up $29 million due to higher equity issuance and foreign exchange trading revenue, partially offset by lower debt issuance revenue. Corporate and investment banking revenue of $265 million was up $19 million or 8%, largely due to higher equity issuance and advisory revenue and higher revenue from corporate banking, partially offset by lower investment gains.\r\nThe provision for credit losses was $14 million compared with a recovery of $1 million due to lower recoveries in the U.S. legacy portfolio. Noninterest expenses were $292 million in the quarter, up $23 million or 9%, primarily due to higher employee-related expenses, including performance-based compensation.\r\nNet income for Wholesale Banking was $216 million for the quarter, in line with the prior year.\r\nSlide 10 reflects the results of the corporate and other segment. Revenue of $115 million was up from $103 million in the prior year as a result of increased securities gains. The provision for credit losses was $9 million compared with $56 million for the prior year. The current quarter included lower losses in CIBC FirstCaribbean and a decrease in the collective allowance.\r\nNoninterest expenses of $288 million were higher compared with the prior year, largely a result of increased employee benefits expense and higher performance-based compensation.\r\nNet loss for the quarter was $45 million compared with a net loss of $60 million in the prior year. Looking to 2015, we anticipate losses in the segment to increase somewhat, more or less in line with the $70 million we had in Q3, mainly due to lower treasury revenue and increased regulatory spending.\r\nCIBC's capital position remains strong. The strength of our earnings is reflected in our Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 10.3%, which increased from 10.1% in the prior quarter. The increase in the CET 1 ratio due to earnings, net of dividends, was partly offset by share repurchases and higher risk-weighted assets. RWAs increased by $1.3 billion, driven by business growth and model parameter updates.\r\nTo wrap up. 2014 was a good year for CIBC, with strong financial results across all businesses. We performed well against our medium-term financial objectives, with a strong return on equity and increasing capital strength. Our headline adjusted EPS growth of 3% was below our medium-term objective of 5% to 10% annual growth, but excluding the impact of the sale of 50% of the employee -- Aeroplan portfolio, EPS increased by 8% compared to last year.\r\nCIBC generated the best 1-year total shareholder return, amongst the big 5 Canadian banks, at 21%. And heading into 2015, we are confident our client-focused strategy positions CIBC well to continue delivering sustainable earnings growth.\r\nWith that, I'd like to turn the meeting over to Laura Dottori.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Kevin. And good morning, everyone.\r\nSo I'll be referring to the risk section, which begins on Slide 14. You'll see that our loan losses in the fourth quarter came in at $194 million, which is in line with the third quarter. So we had lower losses in credit cards and CIBC FirstCaribbean, and these were offset by higher losses in the U.S. legacy real estate portfolio and a lower release in the collective allowance for non-impaired loans.\r\nTurning to Slide 15, we highlight new formations, along with gross and net impaired loans, by geography. Here you can see that new formations were down this quarter across both the consumer and business and government portfolios. And gross impaired loans were down from last quarter, with declines seen across the Canadian portfolio and the Caribbean business and government portfolio.\r\nTurning to cards, on Slide 16. Our net credit losses were $96 million this quarter, and that's down $6 million from the third quarter.\r\nSlide 17 shows our Canadian residential mortgage exposures. The insured portion of our portfolio is 67%, with 90% of the insurance being provided by the CMHC. The weighted average loan-to-value of our uninsured portfolio is 60%, and condos account for 11% of the total Canadian mortgage portfolio.\r\nTurning to Slide 18, you can see our condo developer exposure. And you'll see that as at October 31, our authorized loans to construction projects were $3 billion. And our drawn loans were $1 billion, which is unchanged from the last quarter.\r\nLastly, on Slide 19, you see the distribution of revenue in our trading portfolios as compared with VaR, and we had positive results in all but 2 days this quarter. Our average trading VaR was $3 million, and that's relatively unchanged from the last quarter.\r\nI will now turn things back to Geoff.\n\n---\n\nThank you. That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now move to questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, can we please have the first question on the phone?",

We're optimistic that we will continue to maintain current retention levels as the balance of the portfolio runs off.\r\nPersonal deposits were up 6%, and mutual funds were up 17% year-over-year on strong net sales of $5 billion.\r\nBusiness banking revenue was $393 million, the highest revenue on record and up 2% from last year due to volume growth. This was partially offset by the impact of lower spreads. Business lending balances were up 7%, and business deposits and GIC balances were up 9% year-over-year.\r\nThe other segment had revenue of $27 million, which was down $119 million compared to last year, due mainly to the impact of the Aero transaction.\r\nThe provision for credit losses was $171 million, down 20% on a year-over-year basis. The decrease was due to lower write-offs and bankruptcies in the cards portfolio, the impact of an initiative to enhance account management practices as well as the sold Aero balances. We also had losses -- we also had lower losses in the business lending portfolio, which again performed well this quarter.\r\nNoninterest expenses were $1.1 billion, up 3% from the prior year, primarily driven by our continued investment in growth initiatives, including expanding our sales force as well as new product launches and innovations in mobile banking.\r\nNet income was down 3% from the prior year quarter. Excluding the impact of the Aero transaction, net income was actually up 7% year-over-year. Net interest margin, or NIMs, were largely stable, down 1% -- down 1 basis point sequentially.\r\nTurning now to Slide 8. Wealth Management had a strong quarter, with double-digit revenue growth across all businesses. Client assets grew 27% from last year or 12% excluding the recently acquired Atlantic Trust businesses -- business. Revenue was $587 million, up $115 million or 24% from the prior year, with solid performances from all business lines. Retail brokerage revenue of $302 million was up $30 million or 11% compared with the prior year due to higher fee-based revenue.\r\nAsset management revenue of $206 million was up $39 million or 23% from last year. This was largely due to a combination of higher client assets under management driven by market appreciation and strong net sales of long-term mutual funds, as well as a higher contribution from our investment in American Century Investments. This represents the 23rd consecutive quarter of positive net sales of long-term mutual funds, with CIBC Asset Management achieving a record $5.4 billion in long-term net sales in fiscal 2014.\r\nPrivate wealth management revenue of $79 million was up $46 million, mainly from the acquisition of Atlantic Trust.\r\nNoninterest expenses of $424 million were up $89 million or 27% from the prior year, mainly as a result of the inclusion of Atlantic Trust as well as higher performance-based compensation.\r\nNet income in Wealth Management was $124 million, up $19 million or 18% from the same quarter last year.\r\nSlide 9 reflects the results of Wholesale Banking, where we delivered another quarter of strong earnings. Revenue was $577 million, up $39 million or 7% compared with the prior year.\r\nCapital markets revenue of $308 million was up $29 million due to higher equity issuance and foreign exchange trading revenue, partially offset by lower debt issuance revenue. Corporate and investment banking revenue of $265 million was up $19 million or 8%, largely due to higher equity issuance and advisory revenue and higher revenue from corporate banking, partially offset by lower investment gains.\r\nThe provision for credit losses was $14 million compared with a recovery of $1 million due to lower recoveries in the U.S. legacy portfolio. Noninterest expenses were $292 million in the quarter, up $23 million or 9%, primarily due to higher employee-related expenses, including performance-based compensation.\r\nNet income for Wholesale Banking was $216 million for the quarter, in line with the prior year.\r\nSlide 10 reflects the results of the corporate and other segment. Revenue of $115 million was up from $103 million in the prior year as a result of increased securities gains. The provision for credit losses was $9 million compared with $56 million for the prior year. The current quarter included lower losses in CIBC FirstCaribbean and a decrease in the collective allowance.\r\nNoninterest expenses of $288 million were higher compared with the prior year, largely a result of increased employee benefits expense and higher performance-based compensation.\r\nNet loss for the quarter was $45 million compared with a net loss of $60 million in the prior year. Looking to 2015, we anticipate losses in the segment to increase somewhat, more or less in line with the $70 million we had in Q3, mainly due to lower treasury revenue and increased regulatory spending.\r\nCIBC's capital position remains strong. The strength of our earnings is reflected in our Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 10.3%, which increased from 10.1% in the prior quarter. The increase in the CET 1 ratio due to earnings, net of dividends, was partly offset by share repurchases and higher risk-weighted assets. RWAs increased by $1.3 billion, driven by business growth and model parameter updates.\r\nTo wrap up. 2014 was a good year for CIBC, with strong financial results across all businesses. We performed well against our medium-term financial objectives, with a strong return on equity and increasing capital strength. Our headline adjusted EPS growth of 3% was below our medium-term objective of 5% to 10% annual growth, but excluding the impact of the sale of 50% of the employee -- Aeroplan portfolio, EPS increased by 8% compared to last year.\r\nCIBC generated the best 1-year total shareholder return, amongst the big 5 Canadian banks, at 21%. And heading into 2015, we are confident our client-focused strategy positions CIBC well to continue delivering sustainable earnings growth.\r\nWith that, I'd like to turn the meeting over to Laura Dottori.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Laura Dottori-Attanasio (Executives)】\nThanks, Kevin. And good morning, everyone.\r\nSo I'll be referring to the risk section, which begins on Slide 14. You'll see that our loan losses in the fourth quarter came in at $194 million, which is in line with the third quarter. So we had lower losses in credit cards and CIBC FirstCaribbean, and these were offset by higher losses in the U.S. legacy real estate portfolio and a lower release in the collective allowance for non-impaired loans.\r\nTurning to Slide 15, we highlight new formations, along with gross and net impaired loans, by geography. Here you can see that new formations were down this quarter across both the consumer and business and government portfolios. And gross impaired loans were down from last quarter, with declines seen across the Canadian portfolio and the Caribbean business and government portfolio.\r\nTurning to cards, on Slide 16. Our net credit losses were $96 million this quarter, and that's down $6 million from the third quarter.\r\nSlide 17 shows our Canadian residential mortgage exposures. The insured portion of our portfolio is 67%, with 90% of the insurance being provided by the CMHC. The weighted average loan-to-value of our uninsured portfolio is 60%, and condos account for 11% of the total Canadian mortgage portfolio.\r\nTurning to Slide 18, you can see our condo developer exposure. And you'll see that as at October 31, our authorized loans to construction projects were $3 billion. And our drawn loans were $1 billion, which is unchanged from the last quarter.\r\nLastly, on Slide 19, you see the distribution of revenue in our trading portfolios as compared with VaR, and we had positive results in all but 2 days this quarter. Our average trading VaR was $3 million, and that's relatively unchanged from the last quarter.\r\nI will now turn things back to Geoff.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Geoffrey Weiss (Executives)】\nThank you. That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now move to questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, can we please have the first question on the phone?",
      "transcript_text3": "David, in terms of the new initiatives that you put in place to gather new customers, and I'm thinking of the agreement that you have with the GTAA as well as the Tim Hortons cards, can you let us know how those have been progressing; and as well what -- and I know this is early days, but how successful you've been in terms of leveraging additional products onto these new customers that have come on board?\n\n---\n\nJohn, so I'd be happy to. Yes, we are making a number of investments, as Victor commented in his remarks, and we're quite happy with how -- the returns we're getting off of them. So I'll speak to a couple of them. And I'll, for sure, touch on the Tim Hortons and the airport. So it started the beginning of the year with Aventura, where we put a lot of effort into redesigning that product and the marketing thereof, and we're now getting high single-digit growth in our travel card space. Mortgages, another one early on, where we said we were going to make sure our CIBC-branded mortgages were strong as we came out of the broker space, investing in mobile advisers, investing in productivity measures, investing in some of our frontline sales capabilities. And now we're seeing mortgage growth of 12% relative to the 3 to 5, if you exclude the benefit of FirstLine. COMPASS, that Victor spoke of, a big investment. We've cut the time to get deep relationships in half. And the level of depth that we're getting from those new sales is multiples of what we had in the business case, so that's returning. And then you've mentioned a couple of other ones that were important too. The Double Double card with Tim Hortons is an important new relationship. That card has been received amazingly well by Canadians. And to your point about getting to depth, which is what we're looking to do, as opposed to another single-product relationship, for new clients that are coming to CIBC through that card, of which there are many and more than what we'd anticipated in our business case, we're achieving over 50% with additional products -- actually, over 50% with a checking account alone. And a checking account, obviously, is fundamental to building that relationship beyond just a credit card. We've not seen anything close to that in prior product launches and in part because it's a different focus on getting to deeper as opposed to launching a product. And then the airport, the airport's been a great success, 3 targeted audiences there. One is newcomers, 100,000 newcomers coming through that airport each year. And we have an offer targeted to newcomers. Second category is travelers, 37 million travelers coming through that airport per year. A lot of individual needs of that group, but one of them is foreign exchange, and we now offer over 30 currencies through the over-the-counter and through ATMs. We have ATMs, some of which offer 4 currencies through that box. And then there's 40,000 employees out at the airport. And when I've been out there, there's invariably someone there working on their day-to-day banking needs that works at the airport. So the investments we have made and we spoke about last quarter are real, real in amount, but the traction is at levels beyond what we'd planned for to date. So it's -- we're getting solid traction out of the investments we've put forth and particularly in the 2 you mentioned, the Double Double and the airport.\n\n---\n\nAnd on the Aventura card, can you give us a sense as to what this has been -- if that has been able to bring in new clients or if this is just conversion of existing CIBC clients onto the new card platform?\n\n---\n\nYes, that's a good question. And I know it's -- we've had a bit of conversion but actually not a tremendous amount. And yes, it has been a source of new clients, in part because we've been out there with a strong offer and a strong market. Firstly, the penguin resonated with Canadians, and because we've marketed and we've marketed with a promo offer, it has been a draw for new clients.\n\n---\n\nJust a question for Victor, just dotting -- connecting some dots here. Your buyback activity has gone down, and it's well below your available capacity under your current program. And then you spent quite a bit of time in your opening remarks commenting about how well the Atlantic Trust and American Century Investments have worked out for you. Just wondering if you're telegraphing anything there as far as M&A activity in 2015. And then I got a quick follow-up.\n\n---\n\nI'm just telegraphing success in terms of the investments that we've made, Gabriel. So you ask about the buyback: I mean, I think about capital management, as we all do here at CIBC across a spectrum. And the first and foremost focus is to make sure that we're well within the dividend payout range through delivering consistency and sustainability of our earnings. And we're right now at the midpoint of the range, and we increased our dividend this quarter. The other 2 areas that we look at in terms of driving growth would be organic growth. And as you just heard David outline all of the initiatives that we have in retail, important initiatives to deepen the client relationship. We have similar investments going on in Wealth Management and in wholesale to strengthen client relationships. That is a component of our capital deployment plan. And the remainder is used toward buybacks and acquisitions. So that's the way we think about it. I think it's a smart, sensible way, a very straightforward way. So on to your next question.\n\n---\n\nThe -- let's consider M&A, though. What's the -- can you draw the parameters around what size of a transaction would then be fully funded with excess capital versus what size of transaction would be partially equity funded? And then as far as what assets you're potentially targeting, are you looking at 100% control? Or would you prefer to go through American Century and partner with them and maintain your ownership level in any new acquisitions there?\n\n---\n\nSo when it comes to pursuing inorganic growth opportunity, we are interested in the asset management sector. And we're interested in the private wealth management sector, which includes private banking. And we're particularly interested in the U.S. market because it is the largest and most fragmented in terms of opportunity. We have made 2 foundational investments there. When it comes to asset management, there are opportunities that American Century seeks out, other asset management opportunities that we identify. We always work with them first to see if that's a fit for their organization, and if it's not, it would be something that complements it. But again, we work in tandem with American Century to strengthen our asset management presence in the U.S. When it comes to private wealth management, we've got Atlantic Trust, which is a leading provider. It has $26 billion, which would put it in the top 30 when it comes to the high-net-worth market in the U.S., but we know that we need scale there. We believe we need to add some banking capability there. So those are the 2 areas that we're most interested in investing in. When you look at the economic parameters, there's 3 things to consider, Gabriel. One is size, and the size that we're looking at right now is in the $1 billion to $2 billion range. And the reason -- and there may be some tuck-ins that Atlantic Trust or American Century may do within their businesses that are below that, but we're looking to get scale in our businesses and, therefore, size is important. But the high end of size is probably in the $2 billion range. When it comes to valuations, we recognize that they're fairly robust in the marketplace today, but I think we have in the past and we will in the future exert discipline in terms of deploying our capital. And we'll always look at it, over the medium term, under CIBC ownership. We look to be accretive on most of these investments within a 3-year time frame. And finally, when it comes to consideration, something that I think you asked as well, at the lower end of that $1 billion, we believe we can do that in cash. At the higher end, we may need to do some equity, but we would -- that would all be a factor of when we do things. So what's most important to note at CIBC is there's lots of opportunity to grow at home in terms of deepening our client relationships, and inorganic growth is just another avenue to continue to grow our company.\n\n---\n\nIf I can just sneak one more in there for David, just on the cards. Balance growth was flat quarter-over-quarter. It's not always a good indication of revenue because of interchange, but I saw a couple of your big peers there, the main card players, growing at double-digits on an annualized basis this quarter. Is that, really, balance transfer stuff? Or what's going on in the marketplace right now?\n\n---\n\nGabriel, yes, I'd break the cards business into 2 categories. So in the travel side, we're growing now at high single-digits. And that's been a full clarity [ph], as you know, for us over the last couple of years. So that -- we're through some change and happy with our broad offering of the Aeroplan and the Aventura product. It's working. Now we're turning our attention to the nontravel cards segment, and we have work to do there that's counterbalancing our success on the travel side right now. And one of the products in that respect was the Tim Hortons Double Double card, which has come out of the gate quite strong. And we've got more in the pipeline. So travel's in great shape. And we're now looking at the nontravel, and I think we're on a path to revitalizing that business substantially as well.\n\n---\n\nSo balance transfer initiatives or...\n\n---\n\nIt's part of the business, but it's not really -- one of the things in Q4 relative to Q3 is we had strong growth Q3 to Q2. Q4 to Q3, there's a bit of seasonality there, so there's not any kind of other kind of factors of note in looking at that business. The momentum is building in the cards after several quarters of declines in the outstandings. This quarter year-over-year, we've got growth in the outstanding balances, and it's a sign of the momentum building in our cards business.\n\n---\n\nIt seems like the losses in the Caribbean -- or the loan losses in the Caribbean, excuse me, have settled down since the charge taken a couple of quarters ago, whereas some of the -- some of your competitors in the region are reporting a heightened level of noise. So can you talk a little bit about how things are going in the Caribbean in the last couple of quarters and perhaps what the near-term outlook for that region is? I know it's still struggling from a GDP perspective, but do you think your loan losses have reached a level where they are at a roughly sustainable level?\n\n---\n\nRob, it's Laura. I'll take that one, and then if David wants to add on. So as you did mention, in the second quarter, we did take a significant provision in the portfolio, which did provide us with better coverage ratios. So this quarter, the number that you're seeing does have some recoveries in it. I guess what I would say is that the portfolio continues to face challenges given economic conditions, but we do feel that our provisions appropriately reflect sort of the current economic situation there. I don't know if, David, you wanted to add anything.\n\n---\n\nNo, I think it's a good answer, Laura. Thank you.\n\n---\n\nWell, maybe I'm going to bug you, anyway, David. I mean, the top line outlook, I guess, is still a challenging one. Should we -- I mean, is a sort of sideways revenue outlook the right way to look at the Caribbean right now?\n\n---\n\nWell, Rob, it's a tough market there right now. The travel -- a lot of the economies there are dependent on travel. Travel really hasn't bounced back from '08, '09. Some of the nations in the Caribbean are feeling the pressure as a result, so yes, it's a tough economic climate in the Caribbean still, and it really hasn't significantly bounced back. So there's actions that we'll be taking to optimize our business. And similar to what we've done in Retail and Business Banking in Canada, we're going to be taking a strong client focus to the Caribbean. But there's no doubt the context we're operating in isn't markedly different from the last couple of years.\n\n---\n\nVictor, a quick question. I mean, another dividend increase. What message are you trying to give us?\n\n---\n\nJust simply doing the right thing as we look at our earnings and our earnings profile and we look at our shareholder base, and we know that the return of capital is an important component of how we operate our bank, Sohrab. The second component is, obviously, having capital there to continue to grow our bank. So we know that income is important to our shareholder base, but what we want to do over the medium term is also continue to invest in CIBC to aid the growth profile, and that's something that the management team, the leadership team here is very excited about and we think we can do with great confidence.\n\n---\n\nSo you said about a 60% -- in 2014, about a 60% capital return. Do you -- would you be happy if you had another 60% capital return in 2015 between buybacks and dividends?\n\n---\n\nLook, we have -- the dividend payout range that we have is 40% to 50%. We're, right now, right at the midpoint. I think being at the midpoint or at the upper end of that midpoint is fine. And then the other component of capital return comes through buybacks, and that's how we get to our 60%. So I think that we want to do what's right for our shareholders and what's right for our company. And there's always the 3 areas. We look at the return of capital, we look at organic growth and we look at inorganic growth. If an inorganic growth opportunity were to arise over the medium term, we'd say, well, then maybe we can rebalance that slightly, but the return of capital, the dividend payout range -- ratio is very important to us and to our shareholders. We recognize that.\n\n---\n\nAnd if I can just quickly ask David -- David, I mean, a nice set of results out of the segment that you run. Do you think this is reflective of the core operating power of that segment? Or do you think this was a bit higher than you would expect it to be?\n\n---\n\nSohrab, thank you for the compliment. The team will appreciate that. Everyone is working hard to enhance our results. There's no doubt that the results coming out of Retail and Business Banking are strengthening. Our revenue growth rates relative to our peer group are -- have moved quite a bit over the last few years. And I do think that there's more that we can do by taking our strong products and now putting a different perspective on it, which is starting from a client first and looking to get to deeper relationships and all the good things that come for clients and for the bank in taking that approach. I guess one thing I'd highlight similar to Q3, last quarter, is we're investing to make all this happen. So we're getting traction on our 2 core -- our 2 objectives. We only have 2: one, accelerate profitable revenue growth; and the other is enhance client experience. This quarter, we've made great progress on both, but that's being done through the inorganic investments that Victor has talked about. So yes, the quarter, on operating leverage, came in maybe on the good side of what I thought we might do. You're right. They're good results, so I'd reemphasize, I guess, what I said last quarter, which is that we continue to invest and that, going into next year, operating leverage will be negative in the first half, say. And then as our investments kind of even out and revenue continues to grow, we'll get to -- we anticipate getting to positive in the second half. This year, we said we'd be better than flat on operating leverage for the year, and we were if you adjust for the impact of the Aeroplan sale. And we've highlighted we're still investing. So good quarter but just sticking with what I said last quarter is we'll have some operating leverage pressure in the first half next year. Thanks, Sohrab.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And I'm just going to sneak one in for Laura. Laura, you continue to sleep well at night notwithstanding what's happening around the world?\n\n---\n\nYes, Sohrab. Only my children keep me up at night.\n\n---\n\nA question for Victor. As well as Retail Business Banking is performing, and I don't dispute that it's doing -- it's performing quite well. It provides 67% or roughly 2/3 of the bank's earnings. And if the credit cycle, which is probably as good as it gets right now, turns, that's certainly going to be a challenge for CIBC. Is now not the time to be more aggressive on inorganic growth opportunities? You have very strong capital. Why not stop the buybacks and do something more transformational in businesses that have good performance as well, wealth and capital markets?\n\n---\n\nPeter, we're investing in all of our businesses. So Retail and Business Banking does deliver the majority of our earnings. We are investing in our platform because we believe that there's an opportunity to deepen client relationships. There truly is. I mean, if you look at the penetration of our investment portfolios with our core client base, it's low relative to what it can be. And the reason we're investing in the technology today is because we want to make it a better experience for our advisers and clients to deepen those relationships and be relevant to our clients. Having said that, there are organic opportunities within Wealth Management and with wholesale as well. And we've got to continue to make sure that those franchises are robust. While we are operating at good scale in both Wealth Management and in wholesale at Canada, we -- in Canada, we think that there's still opportunity to grow. And therefore, we're investing in those businesses, but they'll be organic investments. When it comes to deploying capital for acquisitions, we try to take the word transformational out of our lexicon because it just -- it's not what we're trying to do. We're trying to build a very strong bank for the long term. We're trying to look at companies that could fit our culture and will contribute not only to the strength of our culture but also will contribute, over the medium term, to our bottom line. That stuff takes time. And when the right time comes, we'll make those investments. But there's so much opportunity at home today that we need to continue to focus on that element of our franchise as well.\n\n---\n\n5 years from today, what would you like the earnings mix at CIBC to look like? Particularly, do you still want -- or would you still be satisfied with 60%-plus coming from Retail Business Banking?\n\n---\n\nWell, I think having a strong retail and business bank is core to what CIBC does and that, if we do this well, we can continue to have Retail and Business Banking contribute the majority of earnings, but the overall earnings pie will increase. I think where you'll see the largest shifts in terms of international earnings will be primarily in Wealth Management. So that'll continue to pivot outside of Canada and be mostly focused on this continent, and you'll see the portion of wholesale earnings that follow our clients from Canada into the U.S. and into the markets that we operate also contribute to that as well. So there'll be more international earnings, but we'll have a very strong Retail and Business Banking.\n\n---\n\nAnd then just a quick question for Geoff Belsher. The corporate and investment banking revenue line was actually -- looked to me, anyway, to be pretty strong. What's driving that? And how much of that strength is coming from your U.S. real estate platform?\n\n---\n\nSo again, we had very solid results in both the corporate bank, on the corporate lending side, and also we had a very good quarter in the underwriting and advisory. So again, it was very solid mix. Again, our U.S. state -- U.S. real estate portfolio continues to perform very well. They had very solid results. We're seeing the CMBS business starting to come back. So again, we have very good spreads in that business, in the U.S. real estate lending business. We also have high utilization rates on the loans. So we're very encouraged with that business.\n\n---\n\nHow -- from the CMBS business, what kind of growth are you going to get this year, do you think?\n\n---\n\nWe think it could be material. So we think it could be very much double-digit growth in the CMBS business, so it's -- we see a material increase likely coming this year in CMBS and U.S. real estate business.\n\n---\n\nAnd how big a contributor is that to Wholesale Banking overall?\n\n---\n\nIt's a material contributor. Our U.S. state -- real estate finance businesses, again we don't disclose, I believe, specific numbers, but it would be a material contributor.\n\n---\n\nWe'll notice it if -- over the next year.\n\n---\n\nYes, I -- hopefully so, yes.\n\n---\n\nMy first question is for David Williamson. And David, it has to do with net interest margin in the segment. Not only for CIBC but for the sector as a whole, it seems like, despite the drop in rates, NIM has held up very well. Wanted to get the outlook for your business in particular, considering not only the rate backdrop but some of the moving parts you have. And specifically, has the benefit from the mortgage broker exit essentially run its course for margin? And at the same time, are you starting to get some pickup as the credit card initiatives, the new ones, are coming on board?\n\n---\n\nSumit, yes, so you're right, our NIMs have been stable for a while now and -- but you're absolutely right. There's always details in behind that. So the FirstLine runoff and conversion over to CIBC, with retaining half the book, that is a lift, so that's kind of helping us each quarter. That's not huge, but it's a net tailwind, for sure. That is being offset in part by -- now we're net-net growing in mortgages. So we've got a mix shift, mortgages being an important product but not the highest-spread product. So although the conversion of FirstLine into our CIBC-branded mortgages is helping. The fact that mortgages as an asset class in general is going up at the rate it is has a bit of an offset to NIMs. The cards business, as for that earlier question, so travel is really coming on. The nontravel, we still have work to do. So our overall balances in cards is not yet really much of a factor, but I anticipate it will, given the success of the Double Double card. We got more in the pipeline coming. And the travel now is fundamentally a different direction than what it's been the last couple of years. So those are a couple of the factors, but going forward, I'd stay with our guidance that we're expecting NIMs to be stable over the near term. The other factor, I guess, is also interest rates, and the factors [ph] are still a bit of a headwind. It's -- as lower interest rates continue to flow through the book, especially in business banking, that's deposit heavy.\n\n---\n\nAnd my last question is also for Geoff Belsher, going back to your business and specifically the underwriting and advisory fees line. You talked about some of the initiatives, specifically in the U.S, that are working well. But when I look at the 14% growth that, that business had this year, it certainly seems like, in the last couple of months, the new issue business domestically has been impacted by the trend in commodity prices. Now mining has been a challenge for 4 years, but when you think about how helpful energy has been to all Canadian bank investment banking revenue side of the business, how does that look to you in 2015?\n\n---\n\nIt's a good question again. So when you look at energy, that's around, let's say, 11% of our Wholesale Banking business when you look at all the different products, but half of that amount come from our lending book, and that's very stable revenue. So the other half of that comes from various capital markets products, including equity new issues and advisory. And while we do anticipate that the equity new issue business in energy is going to be down, we expect that to be offset by strong commodity revenues. And we also expect some good advisory revenues as some of these energy companies look to swap out assets. So all in all, we think the change in the energy business is quite manageable in the context of our overall business.\n\n---\n\nAnd just to be clear, if I look specifically at, let's say, underwriting, financing activity. Leave M&A, leave trading, leave lending out of the equation. If I say -- energy with pipelines, infrastructure included in that category, if I say it's 20% to 30% of underwriting, am I in the ballpark?\n\n---\n\nWell, again, if you'd look at just pure energy without the infrastructure that's off [ph], it would probably be a little bit more than 30% of underwriting, but again, there's gives and takes. We've seen the real estate market starting to come back on the REIT side. We've seen pretty strong issuance in the power and utilities market. So these markets have gives and takes all the time. And again, when we look at our overall business, we think that the extent that there's some weakness in the new issue business in energy, then there's other mitigants to that.\n\n---\n\nFirst, just a quick follow-up for David on cards again. You've got exclusivity on the Double Double-like card that has the reward button on it. Just wondering, how long is that exclusivity? And do you expect to use that technology for some of the new card offerings you hinted at earlier as you build out your nontravel card offerings, or not necessarily?\n\n---\n\nSteve, yes, it's a multiyear exclusivity. And we're in stages of just extending that out a bit further right now. So it's multiyear exclusivity, which is exciting, because it's a technology, as you've highlighted, that does have different applications. The initiative in the nontravel we've got in the pipeline right now is not a multi-button, but we do [indiscernible]. The focus on the Double Double, it's a big initiative, and the energy is really on launching that and have it be successful. So the next one down the pipe on that, I have very clearly in my mind, but we're still on a launch mode for the current one. So exclusivity for Double Double, which is great, as far as that offering innovative and keeping it exclusive, but you're absolutely right. There's ideas that we have to use that technology in other applications.\n\n---\n\nAnd then for Kevin or Laura, on Page 7 of the regulatory supplemental, I noted that the real estate secured in personal lending, the risk-weighted assets associated with that line have been quite stable around $7 billion, but I saw it popped up over -- to over $9 billion in Q4. So just wondering if that has anything to do with the parameter changes that you mentioned earlier, Kevin, or if there's something else in terms of assumption changes or I'm not sure what, impacting that line.\n\n---\n\nYes, it's Laura. So that had to do principally with model parameter updates that we did in that space.\n\n---\n\nSo is that adjustments to probably default or loss-given default assumptions that go into the advanced AIRB calculation?\n\n---\n\nYes, it is.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Is that something that you reviewed? I mean, that's been quite stable for some time. Is that just a one-off in terms of the frequency that you update that line? Because it had been -- looks at -- fairly stable for at least the last 1.5 years.\n\n---\n\nYes, I wouldn't say a one-off. We do annual reviews of all of our different portfolios and parameters, and so that was just part of that process.\n\n---\n\nMost of my questions have been asked, but I guess, Victor, maybe I can go back to the -- your thought process in M&A in the U.S. And just wanted to confirm that I heard it correct that you would prefer to do the asset management type acquisitions first through American Century partnership there. And then I'm just trying to get a sense of your preference between asset management and private banking. We know asset management valuations have been fairly robust, as you indicated. And from a fragmented perspective, it looks like private banking is a better opportunity from a rolling-up perspective, but it's not a $1 billion to $2 billion acquisition. There's a lot of smaller type of firms out there. So just trying to wrap my mind around that. And then I have a follow-up question.\n\n---\n\nSure. So they're both attractive segments. American Century will probably -- the opportunities through American Century will largely be tuck-in and strengthening of their existing capabilities. One thing we don't really want to do is build out a multi-boutique asset manager. If there's something that we feel really strongly about that doesn't fit within American Century, that might be a complement to it, but that would be it. In terms of the private banking piece and strengthening our private wealth management platform, we do think that scale matters. And we have received lots of overtures from our Atlantic Trust client saying that, \"You're a strong bank. It would be great if you had some capability down here that we could bank through you.\" So that, we see as a positive as well. So they're both attractive, Doug. I don't lean to one or the other. We look at it over the medium term, what helps us build a stronger, more robust presence in the U.S. marketplace.\n\n---\n\nAnd when you think of timing, Victor, I know it's a tough one to ask and answer, but is this something that you feel compelled to act upon sooner than later? Or you talked about discipline and kind of the ability to wait. Is that more the way that you're approaching this?\n\n---\n\nWell, you look at everything over the medium term here. That's how we're thinking about it as a leadership team. There are some interesting companies that I would say have some level of scarcity value because of their unique attributes. We'd say, if the culture fits, if the math works, we would do those. If it doesn't work for now, we just -- we take our time, not because we have leisurely time available, but because we have lots of opportunity to continue to grow our business in Canada, and that is a fact. You look at our retail and business bank, our wholesale franchise and our Wealth Management franchise. While we are strong in our home market, there is still plenty of room to grow.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then just on wealth, the -- it seems like, sequentially, you had good asset growth. You had great net flows, but earnings kind of came off sequentially. It looked like your noninterest expense kind of popped up, and I think that's related to compensation. Just trying to get a little bit more detail because you -- I didn't see the leverage in the wealth side this quarter that I would have anticipated, given the asset growth that we saw.\n\n---\n\nWell, why don't I pass that on to Steve Geist. You haven't heard his voice. He's here too, so he can give you the answer to that, Doug.\n\n---\n\nThanks very much, and hello, Doug. The Q4 earnings were flat to last quarter, as you note, with overall good growth year-over-year. We did have in Q4 some higher compensation-related accruals as well as some Atlantic Trust integration costs that increased expenses that we're expecting wouldn't repeat. If we backed Atlantic Trust out of the Q4 numbers, you'd see some stronger operating leverage and positive operating leverage there.\n\n---\n\nAnd can you quantify what that amount was?\n\n---\n\nIt -- apparently not, sorry.\n\n---\n\nYou definitely talk about technology a lot. It's been an ongoing scene. And I'm wondering if you view technology as a sustainable or a sustainable competitive advantage for CIBC, one that you're developing. Or is it really just kind of the cost of entry, just what you need to do business in 2014, 2015?\n\n---\n\nLet me just give you the preface to how we think about it. Our bank actually has an innovative streak within it that dates back to the first bank to put PCs in the branches, to the first bank to launch PC banking, to the first bank to launch online banking in our country and the first bank to launch mobile banking. That is sort of in our DNA. As you hear the narrative from our business leaders, the technology reinvestments we are making now are to modernize our bank. In Retail and Business Banking, I think David was quite articulate in outlining what he's doing there. In Wealth Management, what we've been focused on is making it easier to do business on -- with us, so less document-laden, more digital in terms of approach, less paper, which makes it friendlier for our advisers and for our clients. And we've been investing in our wholesale bank in terms of strengthening the platform there. And some of the investments that we've made have allowed us to establish a leadership position by making it easy -- easier for our clients to do business with us and, quite frankly, by making it more profitable to do business with us. I thought I'd hand the mic over to Harry Culham, who is our Co-head of Wholesale Banking and oversees capital markets, to talk about that.\n\n---\n\nSure. Hi, Meny. What I would say is that the 2 components to serving your clients a lot better in the capital markets area is really our technology and talent, and we've made a lot of progress in both those areas over the last number of years. Technology has been a focal point in terms of investment. We have new systems in place across capital markets, across product, and this allows us for innovative -- innovation and also speed to market for our clients. So we're going to continue to invest in technology. It is very, very important to serving our clients in a more meaningful way.\n\n---\n\nIt's Stefan from Citi. I've got 2 questions. The first one is for Laura. Laura, sorry to bring you back to the risk-weighted assets. In the credit RWAs, as we saw, there were some model updates which pushed RWAs higher, but there was also an offsetting other adjustment, which looks quite high relative to previous quarters. Can you just give us some color on what that downward adjustment is due to? And the second question, I guess, for Kevin, on the liquidity coverage ratio. Kevin, can you give us some color how far away are you from the requirement of around 100%; and just a time line as to when you would get there, if you're not there already?\n\n---\n\nOkay, Stefan, I'll start. So as it relates to your risk-weighted asset question, I guess, under the heading of other, so that is really related to time decay. It's really a reduction in the tenor of our exposures. So that's why you're seeing the lower risk-weighted assets.\n\n---\n\nSo that's basically due to the natural runoff of the book rather than any proactive decline in the tenor. Is that how I should take it?\n\n---\n\nThat's right.\n\n---\n\nAnd then Stefan, with respect to liquidity coverage ratio, we'll start reporting that in Q2. Based on our calculations, right now, we're in good shape. So I don't anticipate any issues in that regard whatsoever.\n\n---\n\nJust, Laura, can you provide some details on your oil and gas portfolio? Why is it actually so volatile and when I look at the balances as well? You don't have any net impairs there either. At what point would you if oil stayed low? And lastly, why is the fair value adjustment for CIBC so high? Is there any information capture in that? I mean, does it tell us something about how you trade, how you fund? Just curious on that.\n\n---\n\nOkay, so I will take the first question, and I'll leave the FVA to Kevin. So I'm not sure on your volatility question. So I'm looking at our SFI, on Page 19. So I don't know that I see that much volatility. You are looking at exposure, so you can expect sort of quarter-over-quarter, you will see moves. And there is seasonality, as you know, in the oil and gas space as it relates to when people are doing their drilling programs and whatnot. Anyhow, as it relates to oil and gas, you can see we're at $5.2 billion. So that's about just under 2% of our overall loans, and it's about 8% of our business loans. So I'd make a few points. So we think our names are quite diversified domestically and internationally. About 80% of our authorizations in this space are to investment-grade companies. I'd say almost half of our clients are actively engaged in hedging so that, if we have a short duration of a rapid decline in prices, it's manageable. And as you're pointing out in your question, it's really a sustained period of decline that would be more challenging for our clients. That said, at CIBC, we're quite prudent in terms of how we extend credit in this space. We regularly review, stress test our portfolio, and we do stress test not just for short declines but for sustained price declines as well. And when we look at our portfolio and we do a sustained price decrease and really shock the book, losses would be quite manageable under either a scenario that we look at. And I would point out that we have not had losses in that space this quarter.\n\n---\n\nAnd Laura, of the 20% that's not investment grade, are those -- could you give us some color as to what kind of company those are?\n\n---\n\nYes. So if you look at the breakdown of our books, so E&P, so exploration and production, is about 60-some-odd percent of that number. And then it's split sort of between the smaller and larger E&P-type companies. And I would point out because, as you know, the sector within oil and gas that tends to get hit first is the services sector, and that only comprises 4% of our overall book.\n\n---\n\nOkay, it's Kevin. So with respect to FVA, I don't think it's any particular reflection of our trading strategies. And it's hard to tell or it's impossible to tell from our perspective what our peers are doing. I mean, there are a number of factors that could drive the difference, because there are some methodology changes just depending on how you treat FVA versus DVA. I think some banks have applied scaling factors. I would tell you that our approach has been to be conservative. We think that we are appropriately reflecting pricing. We feel that we've approached this in the most appropriate basis. And also, moving forward, we don't anticipate any significant volatility in this number. We'll price and hedge these risks on a portfolio basis so that volatility moving forward will be low as well. So not sure exactly what our peers have done. Also, some of them may have taken some reserves in prior quarters as well, so that could have impacted it, but we're very comfortable with the charges we've taken, and I feel that it's appropriate.\n\n---\n\nI'll be quick. For Kevin, the -- we know that there's at least one important tax change coming up next quarter. Rather than asking how much of your profits in domestic retail relate to creditor insurance, can you give me a sense of what you'd expect the tax rate to do from this quarter to next quarter either in domestic retail or on a total bank basis? Like about -- like, is it -- would it be about a 100 basis point increase? Or anything there?\n\n---\n\nYes, sure. I think our tax rate this quarter was actually unusually low, and that was more a factor of some onetime credits that came through, Mario. So we were low 15s. We think that we will probably operate more in the 16% to 18% range, and that's what I would look at moving forward.\n\n---\n\nBut specifically, the change in taxes related to creditor insurance, that on its own, does it have an impact on the tax rate in domestic retail, for example?\n\n---\n\nI mean, I certainly wouldn't want to get into specifics of any particular issue that may be out there, but I would say that particular item, for us, on a tax rate basis is not going to have a material impact moving forward. So that's not what's driving this rate issue.\n\n---\n\nJust one follow-up question, energy related, for Laura. Can you give us the mix on that energy book then? How much of that $5.2 billion is in Canada versus the U.S?\n\n---\n\nYes. Hello, Brian. I can certainly do that. So we would find that about 35% of it would be in the U.S.\n\n---\n\nThank you, operator. Well, that concludes our call. If anyone has any follow-up questions, please call our investor relations department.\r\nThanks again for joining us this morning. On behalf of the team at CIBC, I'd like to wish everyone a happy and safe holiday season and new year. Have a great day.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: John Aiken (Analysts)】\nDavid, in terms of the new initiatives that you put in place to gather new customers, and I'm thinking of the agreement that you have with the GTAA as well as the Tim Hortons cards, can you let us know how those have been progressing; and as well what -- and I know this is early days, but how successful you've been in terms of leveraging additional products onto these new customers that have come on board?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Williamson (Executives)】\nJohn, so I'd be happy to. Yes, we are making a number of investments, as Victor commented in his remarks, and we're quite happy with how -- the returns we're getting off of them. So I'll speak to a couple of them. And I'll, for sure, touch on the Tim Hortons and the airport. So it started the beginning of the year with Aventura, where we put a lot of effort into redesigning that product and the marketing thereof, and we're now getting high single-digit growth in our travel card space. Mortgages, another one early on, where we said we were going to make sure our CIBC-branded mortgages were strong as we came out of the broker space, investing in mobile advisers, investing in productivity measures, investing in some of our frontline sales capabilities. And now we're seeing mortgage growth of 12% relative to the 3 to 5, if you exclude the benefit of FirstLine. COMPASS, that Victor spoke of, a big investment. We've cut the time to get deep relationships in half. And the level of depth that we're getting from those new sales is multiples of what we had in the business case, so that's returning. And then you've mentioned a couple of other ones that were important too. The Double Double card with Tim Hortons is an important new relationship. That card has been received amazingly well by Canadians. And to your point about getting to depth, which is what we're looking to do, as opposed to another single-product relationship, for new clients that are coming to CIBC through that card, of which there are many and more than what we'd anticipated in our business case, we're achieving over 50% with additional products -- actually, over 50% with a checking account alone. And a checking account, obviously, is fundamental to building that relationship beyond just a credit card. We've not seen anything close to that in prior product launches and in part because it's a different focus on getting to deeper as opposed to launching a product. And then the airport, the airport's been a great success, 3 targeted audiences there. One is newcomers, 100,000 newcomers coming through that airport each year. And we have an offer targeted to newcomers. Second category is travelers, 37 million travelers coming through that airport per year. A lot of individual needs of that group, but one of them is foreign exchange, and we now offer over 30 currencies through the over-the-counter and through ATMs. We have ATMs, some of which offer 4 currencies through that box. And then there's 40,000 employees out at the airport. And when I've been out there, there's invariably someone there working on their day-to-day banking needs that works at the airport. So the investments we have made and we spoke about last quarter are real, real in amount, but the traction is at levels beyond what we'd planned for to date. So it's -- we're getting solid traction out of the investments we've put forth and particularly in the 2 you mentioned, the Double Double and the airport.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Aiken (Analysts)】\nAnd on the Aventura card, can you give us a sense as to what this has been -- if that has been able to bring in new clients or if this is just conversion of existing CIBC clients onto the new card platform?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Williamson (Executives)】\nYes, that's a good question. And I know it's -- we've had a bit of conversion but actually not a tremendous amount. And yes, it has been a source of new clients, in part because we've been out there with a strong offer and a strong market. Firstly, the penguin resonated with Canadians, and because we've marketed and we've marketed with a promo offer, it has been a draw for new clients.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gabriel Dechaine (Analysts)】\nJust a question for Victor, just dotting -- connecting some dots here. Your buyback activity has gone down, and it's well below your available capacity under your current program. And then you spent quite a bit of time in your opening remarks commenting about how well the Atlantic Trust and American Century Investments have worked out for you. Just wondering if you're telegraphing anything there as far as M&A activity in 2015. And then I got a quick follow-up.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Victor Dodig (Executives)】\nI'm just telegraphing success in terms of the investments that we've made, Gabriel. So you ask about the buyback: I mean, I think about capital management, as we all do here at CIBC across a spectrum. And the first and foremost focus is to make sure that we're well within the dividend payout range through delivering consistency and sustainability of our earnings. And we're right now at the midpoint of the range, and we increased our dividend this quarter. The other 2 areas that we look at in terms of driving growth would be organic growth. And as you just heard David outline all of the initiatives that we have in retail, important initiatives to deepen the client relationship. We have similar investments going on in Wealth Management and in wholesale to strengthen client relationships. That is a component of our capital deployment plan. And the remainder is used toward buybacks and acquisitions. So that's the way we think about it. I think it's a smart, sensible way, a very straightforward way. So on to your next question.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gabriel Dechaine (Analysts)】\nThe -- let's consider M&A, though. What's the -- can you draw the parameters around what size of a transaction would then be fully funded with excess capital versus what size of transaction would be partially equity funded? And then as far as what assets you're potentially targeting, are you looking at 100% control? Or would you prefer to go through American Century and partner with them and maintain your ownership level in any new acquisitions there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Victor Dodig (Executives)】\nSo when it comes to pursuing inorganic growth opportunity, we are interested in the asset management sector. And we're interested in the private wealth management sector, which includes private banking. And we're particularly interested in the U.S. market because it is the largest and most fragmented in terms of opportunity. We have made 2 foundational investments there. When it comes to asset management, there are opportunities that American Century seeks out, other asset management opportunities that we identify. We always work with them first to see if that's a fit for their organization, and if it's not, it would be something that complements it. But again, we work in tandem with American Century to strengthen our asset management presence in the U.S. When it comes to private wealth management, we've got Atlantic Trust, which is a leading provider. It has $26 billion, which would put it in the top 30 when it comes to the high-net-worth market in the U.S., but we know that we need scale there. We believe we need to add some banking capability there. So those are the 2 areas that we're most interested in investing in. When you look at the economic parameters, there's 3 things to consider, Gabriel. One is size, and the size that we're looking at right now is in the $1 billion to $2 billion range. And the reason -- and there may be some tuck-ins that Atlantic Trust or American Century may do within their businesses that are below that, but we're looking to get scale in our businesses and, therefore, size is important. But the high end of size is probably in the $2 billion range. When it comes to valuations, we recognize that they're fairly robust in the marketplace today, but I think we have in the past and we will in the future exert discipline in terms of deploying our capital. And we'll always look at it, over the medium term, under CIBC ownership. We look to be accretive on most of these investments within a 3-year time frame. And finally, when it comes to consideration, something that I think you asked as well, at the lower end of that $1 billion, we believe we can do that in cash. At the higher end, we may need to do some equity, but we would -- that would all be a factor of when we do things. So what's most important to note at CIBC is there's lots of opportunity to grow at home in terms of deepening our client relationships, and inorganic growth is just another avenue to continue to grow our company.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gabriel Dechaine (Analysts)】\nIf I can just sneak one more in there for David, just on the cards. Balance growth was flat quarter-over-quarter. It's not always a good indication of revenue because of interchange, but I saw a couple of your big peers there, the main card players, growing at double-digits on an annualized basis this quarter. Is that, really, balance transfer stuff? Or what's going on in the marketplace right now?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Williamson (Executives)】\nGabriel, yes, I'd break the cards business into 2 categories. So in the travel side, we're growing now at high single-digits. And that's been a full clarity [ph], as you know, for us over the last couple of years. So that -- we're through some change and happy with our broad offering of the Aeroplan and the Aventura product. It's working. Now we're turning our attention to the nontravel cards segment, and we have work to do there that's counterbalancing our success on the travel side right now. And one of the products in that respect was the Tim Hortons Double Double card, which has come out of the gate quite strong. And we've got more in the pipeline. So travel's in great shape. And we're now looking at the nontravel, and I think we're on a path to revitalizing that business substantially as well.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gabriel Dechaine (Analysts)】\nSo balance transfer initiatives or...\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Williamson (Executives)】\nIt's part of the business, but it's not really -- one of the things in Q4 relative to Q3 is we had strong growth Q3 to Q2. Q4 to Q3, there's a bit of seasonality there, so there's not any kind of other kind of factors of note in looking at that business. The momentum is building in the cards after several quarters of declines in the outstandings. This quarter year-over-year, we've got growth in the outstanding balances, and it's a sign of the momentum building in our cards business.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Sedran (Analysts)】\nIt seems like the losses in the Caribbean -- or the loan losses in the Caribbean, excuse me, have settled down since the charge taken a couple of quarters ago, whereas some of the -- some of your competitors in the region are reporting a heightened level of noise. So can you talk a little bit about how things are going in the Caribbean in the last couple of quarters and perhaps what the near-term outlook for that region is? I know it's still struggling from a GDP perspective, but do you think your loan losses have reached a level where they are at a roughly sustainable level?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laura Dottori-Attanasio (Executives)】\nRob, it's Laura. I'll take that one, and then if David wants to add on. So as you did mention, in the second quarter, we did take a significant provision in the portfolio, which did provide us with better coverage ratios. So this quarter, the number that you're seeing does have some recoveries in it. I guess what I would say is that the portfolio continues to face challenges given economic conditions, but we do feel that our provisions appropriately reflect sort of the current economic situation there. I don't know if, David, you wanted to add anything.\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Williamson (Executives)】\nNo, I think it's a good answer, Laura. Thank you.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Sedran (Analysts)】\nWell, maybe I'm going to bug you, anyway, David. I mean, the top line outlook, I guess, is still a challenging one. Should we -- I mean, is a sort of sideways revenue outlook the right way to look at the Caribbean right now?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Williamson (Executives)】\nWell, Rob, it's a tough market there right now. The travel -- a lot of the economies there are dependent on travel. Travel really hasn't bounced back from '08, '09. Some of the nations in the Caribbean are feeling the pressure as a result, so yes, it's a tough economic climate in the Caribbean still, and it really hasn't significantly bounced back. So there's actions that we'll be taking to optimize our business. And similar to what we've done in Retail and Business Banking in Canada, we're going to be taking a strong client focus to the Caribbean. But there's no doubt the context we're operating in isn't markedly different from the last couple of years.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sohrab Movahedi (Analysts)】\nVictor, a quick question. I mean, another dividend increase. What message are you trying to give us?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Victor Dodig (Executives)】\nJust simply doing the right thing as we look at our earnings and our earnings profile and we look at our shareholder base, and we know that the return of capital is an important component of how we operate our bank, Sohrab. The second component is, obviously, having capital there to continue to grow our bank. So we know that income is important to our shareholder base, but what we want to do over the medium term is also continue to invest in CIBC to aid the growth profile, and that's something that the management team, the leadership team here is very excited about and we think we can do with great confidence.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sohrab Movahedi (Analysts)】\nSo you said about a 60% -- in 2014, about a 60% capital return. Do you -- would you be happy if you had another 60% capital return in 2015 between buybacks and dividends?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Victor Dodig (Executives)】\nLook, we have -- the dividend payout range that we have is 40% to 50%. We're, right now, right at the midpoint. I think being at the midpoint or at the upper end of that midpoint is fine. And then the other component of capital return comes through buybacks, and that's how we get to our 60%. So I think that we want to do what's right for our shareholders and what's right for our company. And there's always the 3 areas. We look at the return of capital, we look at organic growth and we look at inorganic growth. If an inorganic growth opportunity were to arise over the medium term, we'd say, well, then maybe we can rebalance that slightly, but the return of capital, the dividend payout range -- ratio is very important to us and to our shareholders. We recognize that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sohrab Movahedi (Analysts)】\nAnd if I can just quickly ask David -- David, I mean, a nice set of results out of the segment that you run. Do you think this is reflective of the core operating power of that segment? Or do you think this was a bit higher than you would expect it to be?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Williamson (Executives)】\nSohrab, thank you for the compliment. The team will appreciate that. Everyone is working hard to enhance our results. There's no doubt that the results coming out of Retail and Business Banking are strengthening. Our revenue growth rates relative to our peer group are -- have moved quite a bit over the last few years. And I do think that there's more that we can do by taking our strong products and now putting a different perspective on it, which is starting from a client first and looking to get to deeper relationships and all the good things that come for clients and for the bank in taking that approach. I guess one thing I'd highlight similar to Q3, last quarter, is we're investing to make all this happen. So we're getting traction on our 2 core -- our 2 objectives. We only have 2: one, accelerate profitable revenue growth; and the other is enhance client experience. This quarter, we've made great progress on both, but that's being done through the inorganic investments that Victor has talked about. So yes, the quarter, on operating leverage, came in maybe on the good side of what I thought we might do. You're right. They're good results, so I'd reemphasize, I guess, what I said last quarter, which is that we continue to invest and that, going into next year, operating leverage will be negative in the first half, say. And then as our investments kind of even out and revenue continues to grow, we'll get to -- we anticipate getting to positive in the second half. This year, we said we'd be better than flat on operating leverage for the year, and we were if you adjust for the impact of the Aeroplan sale. And we've highlighted we're still investing. So good quarter but just sticking with what I said last quarter is we'll have some operating leverage pressure in the first half next year. Thanks, Sohrab.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sohrab Movahedi (Analysts)】\nGreat. And I'm just going to sneak one in for Laura. Laura, you continue to sleep well at night notwithstanding what's happening around the world?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laura Dottori-Attanasio (Executives)】\nYes, Sohrab. Only my children keep me up at night.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Peter Routledge (Analysts)】\nA question for Victor. As well as Retail Business Banking is performing, and I don't dispute that it's doing -- it's performing quite well. It provides 67% or roughly 2/3 of the bank's earnings. And if the credit cycle, which is probably as good as it gets right now, turns, that's certainly going to be a challenge for CIBC. Is now not the time to be more aggressive on inorganic growth opportunities? You have very strong capital. Why not stop the buybacks and do something more transformational in businesses that have good performance as well, wealth and capital markets?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Victor Dodig (Executives)】\nPeter, we're investing in all of our businesses. So Retail and Business Banking does deliver the majority of our earnings. We are investing in our platform because we believe that there's an opportunity to deepen client relationships. There truly is. I mean, if you look at the penetration of our investment portfolios with our core client base, it's low relative to what it can be. And the reason we're investing in the technology today is because we want to make it a better experience for our advisers and clients to deepen those relationships and be relevant to our clients. Having said that, there are organic opportunities within Wealth Management and with wholesale as well. And we've got to continue to make sure that those franchises are robust. While we are operating at good scale in both Wealth Management and in wholesale at Canada, we -- in Canada, we think that there's still opportunity to grow. And therefore, we're investing in those businesses, but they'll be organic investments. When it comes to deploying capital for acquisitions, we try to take the word transformational out of our lexicon because it just -- it's not what we're trying to do. We're trying to build a very strong bank for the long term. We're trying to look at companies that could fit our culture and will contribute not only to the strength of our culture but also will contribute, over the medium term, to our bottom line. That stuff takes time. And when the right time comes, we'll make those investments. But there's so much opportunity at home today that we need to continue to focus on that element of our franchise as well.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Peter Routledge (Analysts)】\n5 years from today, what would you like the earnings mix at CIBC to look like? Particularly, do you still want -- or would you still be satisfied with 60%-plus coming from Retail Business Banking?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Victor Dodig (Executives)】\nWell, I think having a strong retail and business bank is core to what CIBC does and that, if we do this well, we can continue to have Retail and Business Banking contribute the majority of earnings, but the overall earnings pie will increase. I think where you'll see the largest shifts in terms of international earnings will be primarily in Wealth Management. So that'll continue to pivot outside of Canada and be mostly focused on this continent, and you'll see the portion of wholesale earnings that follow our clients from Canada into the U.S. and into the markets that we operate also contribute to that as well. So there'll be more international earnings, but we'll have a very strong Retail and Business Banking.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Peter Routledge (Analysts)】\nAnd then just a quick question for Geoff Belsher. The corporate and investment banking revenue line was actually -- looked to me, anyway, to be pretty strong. What's driving that? And how much of that strength is coming from your U.S. real estate platform?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Geoffrey Belsher (Executives)】\nSo again, we had very solid results in both the corporate bank, on the corporate lending side, and also we had a very good quarter in the underwriting and advisory. So again, it was very solid mix. Again, our U.S. state -- U.S. real estate portfolio continues to perform very well. They had very solid results. We're seeing the CMBS business starting to come back. So again, we have very good spreads in that business, in the U.S. real estate lending business. We also have high utilization rates on the loans. So we're very encouraged with that business.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Peter Routledge (Analysts)】\nHow -- from the CMBS business, what kind of growth are you going to get this year, do you think?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Geoffrey Belsher (Executives)】\nWe think it could be material. So we think it could be very much double-digit growth in the CMBS business, so it's -- we see a material increase likely coming this year in CMBS and U.S. real estate business.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Peter Routledge (Analysts)】\nAnd how big a contributor is that to Wholesale Banking overall?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Geoffrey Belsher (Executives)】\nIt's a material contributor. Our U.S. state -- real estate finance businesses, again we don't disclose, I believe, specific numbers, but it would be a material contributor.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Peter Routledge (Analysts)】\nWe'll notice it if -- over the next year.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Geoffrey Belsher (Executives)】\nYes, I -- hopefully so, yes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sumit Malhotra (Analysts)】\nMy first question is for David Williamson. And David, it has to do with net interest margin in the segment. Not only for CIBC but for the sector as a whole, it seems like, despite the drop in rates, NIM has held up very well. Wanted to get the outlook for your business in particular, considering not only the rate backdrop but some of the moving parts you have. And specifically, has the benefit from the mortgage broker exit essentially run its course for margin? And at the same time, are you starting to get some pickup as the credit card initiatives, the new ones, are coming on board?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Williamson (Executives)】\nSumit, yes, so you're right, our NIMs have been stable for a while now and -- but you're absolutely right. There's always details in behind that. So the FirstLine runoff and conversion over to CIBC, with retaining half the book, that is a lift, so that's kind of helping us each quarter. That's not huge, but it's a net tailwind, for sure. That is being offset in part by -- now we're net-net growing in mortgages. So we've got a mix shift, mortgages being an important product but not the highest-spread product. So although the conversion of FirstLine into our CIBC-branded mortgages is helping. The fact that mortgages as an asset class in general is going up at the rate it is has a bit of an offset to NIMs. The cards business, as for that earlier question, so travel is really coming on. The nontravel, we still have work to do. So our overall balances in cards is not yet really much of a factor, but I anticipate it will, given the success of the Double Double card. We got more in the pipeline coming. And the travel now is fundamentally a different direction than what it's been the last couple of years. So those are a couple of the factors, but going forward, I'd stay with our guidance that we're expecting NIMs to be stable over the near term. The other factor, I guess, is also interest rates, and the factors [ph] are still a bit of a headwind. It's -- as lower interest rates continue to flow through the book, especially in business banking, that's deposit heavy.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sumit Malhotra (Analysts)】\nAnd my last question is also for Geoff Belsher, going back to your business and specifically the underwriting and advisory fees line. You talked about some of the initiatives, specifically in the U.S, that are working well. But when I look at the 14% growth that, that business had this year, it certainly seems like, in the last couple of months, the new issue business domestically has been impacted by the trend in commodity prices. Now mining has been a challenge for 4 years, but when you think about how helpful energy has been to all Canadian bank investment banking revenue side of the business, how does that look to you in 2015?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Geoffrey Belsher (Executives)】\nIt's a good question again. So when you look at energy, that's around, let's say, 11% of our Wholesale Banking business when you look at all the different products, but half of that amount come from our lending book, and that's very stable revenue. So the other half of that comes from various capital markets products, including equity new issues and advisory. And while we do anticipate that the equity new issue business in energy is going to be down, we expect that to be offset by strong commodity revenues. And we also expect some good advisory revenues as some of these energy companies look to swap out assets. So all in all, we think the change in the energy business is quite manageable in the context of our overall business.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sumit Malhotra (Analysts)】\nAnd just to be clear, if I look specifically at, let's say, underwriting, financing activity. Leave M&A, leave trading, leave lending out of the equation. If I say -- energy with pipelines, infrastructure included in that category, if I say it's 20% to 30% of underwriting, am I in the ballpark?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Geoffrey Belsher (Executives)】\nWell, again, if you'd look at just pure energy without the infrastructure that's off [ph], it would probably be a little bit more than 30% of underwriting, but again, there's gives and takes. We've seen the real estate market starting to come back on the REIT side. We've seen pretty strong issuance in the power and utilities market. So these markets have gives and takes all the time. And again, when we look at our overall business, we think that the extent that there's some weakness in the new issue business in energy, then there's other mitigants to that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Steve Theriault (Analysts)】\nFirst, just a quick follow-up for David on cards again. You've got exclusivity on the Double Double-like card that has the reward button on it. Just wondering, how long is that exclusivity? And do you expect to use that technology for some of the new card offerings you hinted at earlier as you build out your nontravel card offerings, or not necessarily?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Williamson (Executives)】\nSteve, yes, it's a multiyear exclusivity. And we're in stages of just extending that out a bit further right now. So it's multiyear exclusivity, which is exciting, because it's a technology, as you've highlighted, that does have different applications. The initiative in the nontravel we've got in the pipeline right now is not a multi-button, but we do [indiscernible]. The focus on the Double Double, it's a big initiative, and the energy is really on launching that and have it be successful. So the next one down the pipe on that, I have very clearly in my mind, but we're still on a launch mode for the current one. So exclusivity for Double Double, which is great, as far as that offering innovative and keeping it exclusive, but you're absolutely right. There's ideas that we have to use that technology in other applications.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Steve Theriault (Analysts)】\nAnd then for Kevin or Laura, on Page 7 of the regulatory supplemental, I noted that the real estate secured in personal lending, the risk-weighted assets associated with that line have been quite stable around $7 billion, but I saw it popped up over -- to over $9 billion in Q4. So just wondering if that has anything to do with the parameter changes that you mentioned earlier, Kevin, or if there's something else in terms of assumption changes or I'm not sure what, impacting that line.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laura Dottori-Attanasio (Executives)】\nYes, it's Laura. So that had to do principally with model parameter updates that we did in that space.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Steve Theriault (Analysts)】\nSo is that adjustments to probably default or loss-given default assumptions that go into the advanced AIRB calculation?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laura Dottori-Attanasio (Executives)】\nYes, it is.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Steve Theriault (Analysts)】\nOkay. Is that something that you reviewed? I mean, that's been quite stable for some time. Is that just a one-off in terms of the frequency that you update that line? Because it had been -- looks at -- fairly stable for at least the last 1.5 years.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laura Dottori-Attanasio (Executives)】\nYes, I wouldn't say a one-off. We do annual reviews of all of our different portfolios and parameters, and so that was just part of that process.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Doug Young (Analysts)】\nMost of my questions have been asked, but I guess, Victor, maybe I can go back to the -- your thought process in M&A in the U.S. And just wanted to confirm that I heard it correct that you would prefer to do the asset management type acquisitions first through American Century partnership there. And then I'm just trying to get a sense of your preference between asset management and private banking. We know asset management valuations have been fairly robust, as you indicated. And from a fragmented perspective, it looks like private banking is a better opportunity from a rolling-up perspective, but it's not a $1 billion to $2 billion acquisition. There's a lot of smaller type of firms out there. So just trying to wrap my mind around that. And then I have a follow-up question.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Victor Dodig (Executives)】\nSure. So they're both attractive segments. American Century will probably -- the opportunities through American Century will largely be tuck-in and strengthening of their existing capabilities. One thing we don't really want to do is build out a multi-boutique asset manager. If there's something that we feel really strongly about that doesn't fit within American Century, that might be a complement to it, but that would be it. In terms of the private banking piece and strengthening our private wealth management platform, we do think that scale matters. And we have received lots of overtures from our Atlantic Trust client saying that, \"You're a strong bank. It would be great if you had some capability down here that we could bank through you.\" So that, we see as a positive as well. So they're both attractive, Doug. I don't lean to one or the other. We look at it over the medium term, what helps us build a stronger, more robust presence in the U.S. marketplace.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Doug Young (Analysts)】\nAnd when you think of timing, Victor, I know it's a tough one to ask and answer, but is this something that you feel compelled to act upon sooner than later? Or you talked about discipline and kind of the ability to wait. Is that more the way that you're approaching this?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Victor Dodig (Executives)】\nWell, you look at everything over the medium term here. That's how we're thinking about it as a leadership team. There are some interesting companies that I would say have some level of scarcity value because of their unique attributes. We'd say, if the culture fits, if the math works, we would do those. If it doesn't work for now, we just -- we take our time, not because we have leisurely time available, but because we have lots of opportunity to continue to grow our business in Canada, and that is a fact. You look at our retail and business bank, our wholesale franchise and our Wealth Management franchise. While we are strong in our home market, there is still plenty of room to grow.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Doug Young (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then just on wealth, the -- it seems like, sequentially, you had good asset growth. You had great net flows, but earnings kind of came off sequentially. It looked like your noninterest expense kind of popped up, and I think that's related to compensation. Just trying to get a little bit more detail because you -- I didn't see the leverage in the wealth side this quarter that I would have anticipated, given the asset growth that we saw.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Victor Dodig (Executives)】\nWell, why don't I pass that on to Steve Geist. You haven't heard his voice. He's here too, so he can give you the answer to that, Doug.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Geist (Executives)】\nThanks very much, and hello, Doug. The Q4 earnings were flat to last quarter, as you note, with overall good growth year-over-year. We did have in Q4 some higher compensation-related accruals as well as some Atlantic Trust integration costs that increased expenses that we're expecting wouldn't repeat. If we backed Atlantic Trust out of the Q4 numbers, you'd see some stronger operating leverage and positive operating leverage there.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Doug Young (Analysts)】\nAnd can you quantify what that amount was?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Geist (Executives)】\nIt -- apparently not, sorry.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Meny Grauman (Analysts)】\nYou definitely talk about technology a lot. It's been an ongoing scene. And I'm wondering if you view technology as a sustainable or a sustainable competitive advantage for CIBC, one that you're developing. Or is it really just kind of the cost of entry, just what you need to do business in 2014, 2015?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Victor Dodig (Executives)】\nLet me just give you the preface to how we think about it. Our bank actually has an innovative streak within it that dates back to the first bank to put PCs in the branches, to the first bank to launch PC banking, to the first bank to launch online banking in our country and the first bank to launch mobile banking. That is sort of in our DNA. As you hear the narrative from our business leaders, the technology reinvestments we are making now are to modernize our bank. In Retail and Business Banking, I think David was quite articulate in outlining what he's doing there. In Wealth Management, what we've been focused on is making it easier to do business on -- with us, so less document-laden, more digital in terms of approach, less paper, which makes it friendlier for our advisers and for our clients. And we've been investing in our wholesale bank in terms of strengthening the platform there. And some of the investments that we've made have allowed us to establish a leadership position by making it easy -- easier for our clients to do business with us and, quite frankly, by making it more profitable to do business with us. I thought I'd hand the mic over to Harry Culham, who is our Co-head of Wholesale Banking and oversees capital markets, to talk about that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Harry Culham (Executives)】\nSure. Hi, Meny. What I would say is that the 2 components to serving your clients a lot better in the capital markets area is really our technology and talent, and we've made a lot of progress in both those areas over the last number of years. Technology has been a focal point in terms of investment. We have new systems in place across capital markets, across product, and this allows us for innovative -- innovation and also speed to market for our clients. So we're going to continue to invest in technology. It is very, very important to serving our clients in a more meaningful way.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Stefan Nedialkov (Analysts)】\nIt's Stefan from Citi. I've got 2 questions. The first one is for Laura. Laura, sorry to bring you back to the risk-weighted assets. In the credit RWAs, as we saw, there were some model updates which pushed RWAs higher, but there was also an offsetting other adjustment, which looks quite high relative to previous quarters. Can you just give us some color on what that downward adjustment is due to? And the second question, I guess, for Kevin, on the liquidity coverage ratio. Kevin, can you give us some color how far away are you from the requirement of around 100%; and just a time line as to when you would get there, if you're not there already?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laura Dottori-Attanasio (Executives)】\nOkay, Stefan, I'll start. So as it relates to your risk-weighted asset question, I guess, under the heading of other, so that is really related to time decay. It's really a reduction in the tenor of our exposures. So that's why you're seeing the lower risk-weighted assets.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Stefan Nedialkov (Analysts)】\nSo that's basically due to the natural runoff of the book rather than any proactive decline in the tenor. Is that how I should take it?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laura Dottori-Attanasio (Executives)】\nThat's right.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kevin Glass (Executives)】\nAnd then Stefan, with respect to liquidity coverage ratio, we'll start reporting that in Q2. Based on our calculations, right now, we're in good shape. So I don't anticipate any issues in that regard whatsoever.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Darko Mihelic (Analysts)】\nJust, Laura, can you provide some details on your oil and gas portfolio? Why is it actually so volatile and when I look at the balances as well? You don't have any net impairs there either. At what point would you if oil stayed low? And lastly, why is the fair value adjustment for CIBC so high? Is there any information capture in that? I mean, does it tell us something about how you trade, how you fund? Just curious on that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laura Dottori-Attanasio (Executives)】\nOkay, so I will take the first question, and I'll leave the FVA to Kevin. So I'm not sure on your volatility question. So I'm looking at our SFI, on Page 19. So I don't know that I see that much volatility. You are looking at exposure, so you can expect sort of quarter-over-quarter, you will see moves. And there is seasonality, as you know, in the oil and gas space as it relates to when people are doing their drilling programs and whatnot. Anyhow, as it relates to oil and gas, you can see we're at $5.2 billion. So that's about just under 2% of our overall loans, and it's about 8% of our business loans. So I'd make a few points. So we think our names are quite diversified domestically and internationally. About 80% of our authorizations in this space are to investment-grade companies. I'd say almost half of our clients are actively engaged in hedging so that, if we have a short duration of a rapid decline in prices, it's manageable. And as you're pointing out in your question, it's really a sustained period of decline that would be more challenging for our clients. That said, at CIBC, we're quite prudent in terms of how we extend credit in this space. We regularly review, stress test our portfolio, and we do stress test not just for short declines but for sustained price declines as well. And when we look at our portfolio and we do a sustained price decrease and really shock the book, losses would be quite manageable under either a scenario that we look at. And I would point out that we have not had losses in that space this quarter.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Darko Mihelic (Analysts)】\nAnd Laura, of the 20% that's not investment grade, are those -- could you give us some color as to what kind of company those are?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laura Dottori-Attanasio (Executives)】\nYes. So if you look at the breakdown of our books, so E&P, so exploration and production, is about 60-some-odd percent of that number. And then it's split sort of between the smaller and larger E&P-type companies. And I would point out because, as you know, the sector within oil and gas that tends to get hit first is the services sector, and that only comprises 4% of our overall book.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kevin Glass (Executives)】\nOkay, it's Kevin. So with respect to FVA, I don't think it's any particular reflection of our trading strategies. And it's hard to tell or it's impossible to tell from our perspective what our peers are doing. I mean, there are a number of factors that could drive the difference, because there are some methodology changes just depending on how you treat FVA versus DVA. I think some banks have applied scaling factors. I would tell you that our approach has been to be conservative. We think that we are appropriately reflecting pricing. We feel that we've approached this in the most appropriate basis. And also, moving forward, we don't anticipate any significant volatility in this number. We'll price and hedge these risks on a portfolio basis so that volatility moving forward will be low as well. So not sure exactly what our peers have done. Also, some of them may have taken some reserves in prior quarters as well, so that could have impacted it, but we're very comfortable with the charges we've taken, and I feel that it's appropriate.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mario Mendonca (Analysts)】\nI'll be quick. For Kevin, the -- we know that there's at least one important tax change coming up next quarter. Rather than asking how much of your profits in domestic retail relate to creditor insurance, can you give me a sense of what you'd expect the tax rate to do from this quarter to next quarter either in domestic retail or on a total bank basis? Like about -- like, is it -- would it be about a 100 basis point increase? Or anything there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kevin Glass (Executives)】\nYes, sure. I think our tax rate this quarter was actually unusually low, and that was more a factor of some onetime credits that came through, Mario. So we were low 15s. We think that we will probably operate more in the 16% to 18% range, and that's what I would look at moving forward.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mario Mendonca (Analysts)】\nBut specifically, the change in taxes related to creditor insurance, that on its own, does it have an impact on the tax rate in domestic retail, for example?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kevin Glass (Executives)】\nI mean, I certainly wouldn't want to get into specifics of any particular issue that may be out there, but I would say that particular item, for us, on a tax rate basis is not going to have a material impact moving forward. So that's not what's driving this rate issue.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Brian Klock (Analysts)】\nJust one follow-up question, energy related, for Laura. Can you give us the mix on that energy book then? How much of that $5.2 billion is in Canada versus the U.S?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laura Dottori-Attanasio (Executives)】\nYes. Hello, Brian. I can certainly do that. So we would find that about 35% of it would be in the U.S.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Geoffrey Weiss (Executives)】\nThank you, operator. Well, that concludes our call. If anyone has any follow-up questions, please call our investor relations department.\r\nThanks again for joining us this morning. On behalf of the team at CIBC, I'd like to wish everyone a happy and safe holiday season and new year. Have a great day.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you, Paulette. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Earlier this morning, we issued our press release announcing our fiscal 2014 earnings results for our fourth quarter and full year and the initiation of our guidance for 2015. Early next week, we will be filing our shareholder report containing management's discussion and analysis in our 2014 audited, consolidated financial statements with the Canadian securities regulatory authorities and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents will also be made available on our website at www.gildan.com.\r\nWith me on the call, I'm joined by Glenn Chamandy, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Laurence Sellyn, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial & Administrative Officer.\r\nOur call today will begin with Laurence taking you through our fourth quarter performance and our business outlook, after which a Q&A session will follow.\r\nBefore we begin, I would like to remind you that today's conference call contains certain statements, which may cause forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements involve unknown and known risks, uncertainties and other factors, which could cause actual results to differ materially from future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. We refer you to the company's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Canadian securities regulatory authorities that may affect the company's future results.\r\nI will now turn the call over to Laurence.\n\n---\n\nGood morning. We will review our fourth quarter results which we reported today, then our rationale for our change to a calendar year end, our strategic pricing actions to reinforce our industry leadership position in Printwear, our guidance for the December quarter and the 2015 calendar year, and our use of cash to further enhance our projected EPS growth and returns on capital, including our initiation of a normal course issuer bid to repurchase shares. We will also discuss our positioning in EPS growth drivers for calendar 2016.\r\nTo begin with the fourth quarter, we reported record results for any fiscal quarter in the company's history and EPS growth of 20% compared to Q4 2013. Sales growth in the quarter was 6.4%. The 20% growth in EPS in the fourth quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2013 was due to the higher year-over-year sales revenues in both Printwear and Branded Apparel, the acquisition of Doris, higher operating margins in both operating segments, and a year-to-date true-up adjustment to our income tax provision due to lower-than-projected sales for Branded Apparel in the fourth quarter.\r\nSales in Printwear grew by 3% in the fourth quarter due to higher net selling prices and more favorable product mix, partially offset by slightly lower unit sales volumes, including the impact of inventory destocking by European distributors in spite a strong POS. Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, the impact on Branded Apparel sales of 60% growth in underwear and close to 30% growth in activewear, together with the contribution of the Doris acquisition, was partially offset by lower sales in socks. The decline in sales of socks was entirely due to lower sales of private label and our decision to exit from a licensing arrangement. Sell-through to consumers of underwear and activewear remains strong, and the company continued to gain market share in men's underwear reaching 7.5% in the month of September; market share increased to 7.8% in October.\r\nSales volumes for Gold Toe brands were also up from last year in spite the weaker market conditions, and Gold Toe continued its upward trend of gaining market share in men's and ladies' socks. However, although up from last year, sales and earnings were both below our guidance provided at the end of July. The shortfall compared to guidance was due to lower-than-projected sales growth in Branded Apparel. Shipments to retailers in all product categories were lower than projected, primarily due to inventory destocking by retailers and delayed timing of servicing fleece programs. In addition, overall market demand was weaker than anticipated.\r\nHowever, we are now seeing good replenishment orders in the December quarter. In addition, the company continues to have strong momentum in gaining new retail programs for 2015 as well as additional shelf space within retail stores and penetration of new retailers. We will later review our assumptions underlying the strong organic sales growth in Branded Apparel, which we are projecting in calendar 2015.\r\nAs a result, primarily of the lower-than-forecast shipments in Branded Apparel in the fourth quarter, inventory levels at the end of the fourth quarter were approximately $50 million higher than planned. Consequently, the company used approximately $25 million of cash for the full fiscal year after capital expenditures of close to $300 million.\r\nBefore discussing our guidance, we would like to discuss the decision to change to a calendar year end. Our historical September year-end has been based on the seasonality of the Printwear business. The September quarter is the end of the annual selling season for Printwear. The December quarter is the lowest seasonal quarter for sales of T-shirts, in which wholesale distributors issue their catalogs with their product offerings for the following year. The reasons for changing from September to December are as follows: firstly, the seasonality of the overall consolidated sales revenues for the company is changing due to the increasing importance of the Branded Apparel segment. Secondly, the company's budgeting and business planning cycle is becoming more aligned with the calendar year, which will provide better visibility on the retail environment and retail program placements. The company will also have better visibility on cotton fixations. And thirdly, the timing of our financial year and initiation of guidance will be aligned with industry comparables.\r\nFor statutory reporting purposes, fiscal 2015 will be a 5-quarter financial year ending in January 2016. 2016 will be our first fiscal year on a calendar basis. However, we are providing guidance for calendar 2015, and we are providing recast comparatives for prior years on a calendar year basis in the Investor Relations section of our website.\r\nSubsequent to the end of the 2014 fiscal year, we've decided to take major strategic pricing actions in Printwear to reinforce our leadership position in the industry. We have decided to significantly lower base selling prices and reduce and simplify our discount structure in order to be responsive to distributors and enhance their ability and visibility to plan their business. In addition, our strategic pricing actions will reinforce our industry leadership position and stimulate end-use demand in order to drive unit sales volume and earnings growth in calendar 2015 and beyond. We have historically followed a strategy to continue to invest in low cost manufacturing capacity and cost reduction projects and pass through a portion of the resulting cost reductions into lower selling prices. The selling price reductions announced today reflect the pass-through of a portion of the expected cost savings from our investments in new yarn-spinning facilities into lower selling prices in order to drive further growth and market share penetration. The pricing actions are strategic and anticipate our projected manufacturing cost reductions, but also reflect further reduction in the price of cotton futures in recent months.\r\nWe are applying the benefit of the reduction in selling prices, announced on December 3, 2014, to existing distributor inventories in the form of a distributor inventory devaluation discount, projected to be approximately $45 million, which will be reflected as a deduction from sales in the quarter ending January 4, 2015. As a result of these actions, we are projecting a net loss of approximately $0.30 per share on projected sales revenues of approximately $400 million for the 3-month period ending January 4, 2015, compared with EPS of $0.35 and sales revenues of $451.4 million in the corresponding calendar quarter of 2013. Sales revenues for Printwear are expected to decline compared to the corresponding quarter of last year due to the impact of the distributor inventory devaluation and anticipated slightly higher-than-normal seasonal distributor destocking in the quarter due to the changes in the company's incentive programs. The December quarter is normally the lower sales quarter of the year for T-shirts.\r\nWe are projecting strong organic growth in sales in Branded Apparel for the quarter ending January 4, 2015, due to new programs and the resumption of inventory replenishment by retailers after the retailer inventory destocking, which impacted sales in the fourth quarter fiscal 2014 and continued into the beginning of the current quarter. Sales for the first quarter also include the impact of the acquisition of Doris. However, margins for Branded Apparel in the quarter are projected to be negatively impacted by inefficiencies in the manufacturer of retail products, related to the consumption of inventories produced during fiscal 2014. In addition, higher brand marketing and advertising expenses in Branded Apparel are projected in the quarter to support holiday sales programs. Margins in both operating segments are projected to be negatively impacted by slightly higher cotton costs than the corresponding quarter of last year.\r\nOur initial EPS guidance for calendar 2015 is for EPS of $3 to $3.15 on sales of close to $2.65 billion. Printwear sales for calendar 2015 are projected to grow by approximately 3% after reflecting the impact of lower selling prices. And sales revenues for Branded Apparel in fiscal 2015 are projected to grow by approximately 13%. Consolidated EBITDA in calendar 2015 is projected to be approximately $525 million to $545 million. Compared to fiscal 2014, the projected growth in EPS in calendar 2015 is due to projected sales volume growth in both operating segments, lower manufacturing costs resulting from capital investment projects and declining cotton costs in the second half of the fiscal year. These positive factors are projected to be largely offset by the impact of lower Printwear selling prices, the impact of transitional manufacturing costs in Branded Apparel as we consume inventories in the first half of the year, inflationary cost increases and higher SG&A expenses, including the impact of increased investment in brand advertising and marketing and higher income taxes.\r\nWe would like to provide more detail in some of these assumptions underlying our guidance. Firstly, we are projecting a strong recovery in Printwear unit volume growth due to our pricing actions, which are expected to result in improved end-use demand and increase market share penetration in the U.S. Printwear market. In addition, sales growth in Printwear will be driven by the continuing development of the Anvil product line up for fashion basics which is performing strongly, and other new high-value products such as performance polo shirts, as well as continuing penetration in all of our international markets in Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America, partially offset by fewer shipping dates compared to fiscal 2014.\r\nSecondly, our sales assumptions for Branded Apparel include only existing programs, the annualization of new programs obtained for 2014 and further new programs which have been confirmed. Our projected sales growth in 2015, on this basis, is driven by increased penetration in Gildan branded underwear and activewear, growth in Gold Toe and Gildan branded socks and increased sales for our licensed brands. We have recently further expanded our licensing relationship with Mossy Oak. The EPS impact of volume growth in Printwear and Branded Apparel in calendar 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 is projected to be approximately $0.60 per share.\r\nSelling prices in Printwear reflect the pricing actions in the December quarter. The projected EPS impact of lower Printwear selling prices is projected to be approximately $0.70 per share. No change is assumed in selling prices in Branded Apparel. The EPS benefit of lower cotton costs in calendar 2015, compared to fiscal 2014, is projected to be approximately $0.35 per share, including the impact on Branded Apparel as well as the impact on Printwear. Because of our high level of opening inventories, it will take longer than previously planned to consume high-costs cotton. Cotton costs will start to decline in the March quarter, and we will increasingly benefit from low cotton futures in the second half of calendar 2015.\r\nWe are projecting manufacturing efficiencies in calendar 2015 from capital investment projects, including the impact of increased depreciation to be partially offset by inflationary cost increases and continuing manufacturing inefficiencies in Branded Apparel due to consumption of inventories in the first half of the fiscal year. The net effect of these factors on EPS, in calendar 2015, is projected to be approximately $0.20 per share.\r\nWe are on track to achieve our projected 3-year target of $100 million in annual cost savings from our manufacturing investments, which are currently underway. All of our new yarn-spinning facilities are projected to be in operation by the end of calendar 2015 and benefits our results in fiscal 2016.\r\nThe other important factors impacting our projected results for calendar 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 are increased SG&A and income tax expenses. As a percentage of consolidated sales revenues, SG&A expenses in calendar 2015 are expected to be comparable to fiscal 2014. The higher income taxes are due to the projected higher operating income in Branded Apparel. The projected effective income tax rate in calendar 2015 is 4.5%.\r\nFinally, our guidance for calendar 2015 includes the full year of EPS accretion from Doris. We are continuing to pursue further acquisitions to complement our organic growth strategies.\r\nEarnings in the first half of calendar 2015 are expected to be flat or slightly lower than the first half of fiscal 2014 due to the margin pressure resulting from lower Printwear selling prices before the company has completed the ramp-up of yarn-spinning facilities and while still consuming higher costs cotton. Earnings growth is projected in the second half of calendar 2015 compared to the second half of fiscal 2014 due to the impact of unit volume growth, manufacturing cost reductions and declining cotton costs.\r\nDuring fiscal 2014, the company has essentially completed its capital investments in the refurbishment of Rio Nance I, the upgrade of the former Anvil textile facility, the Honduras distribution center and the new Salisbury, North Carolina ring-spun yarn-spinning facility. The company plans to spend $350 million to $400 million in capital expenditures in the 15 months 2015 fiscal year and approximately $250 million to $300 million in calendar 2015. The $100 million, which is being invested in the December quarter, is primarily for our new yarn-spinning facilities, which will be ramped up during calendar 2015.\r\nIn addition to the continuing investments in yarn-spinning, the other main capital investment projects in calendar 2015 are for our 2 new textile facilities, the new Rio Nance VI facility and the new Costa Rica facility as well as a new cost reduction project to further significantly reduce energy costs, the expansion of sewing facilities to support growth in retail and the expansion of our Eden, North Carolina distribution center.\r\nWe are projecting a reduction of inventory levels in calendar 2015 although our intention is to maintain inventories at higher-than-historical levels in order to ensure that we're in a strong position to service replenishment demand throughout the year in both Printwear and Branded Apparel. Our investment in inventory will also be reduced by the declining cost of cotton and lower manufacturing costs.\r\nThe earnings momentum in Q4 of calendar 2015 is expected to continue into calendar 2016. The drivers of earnings growth in fiscal 2016 are expected to be the following: firstly, sales, unit volume growth in both operating segments; secondly, further significant manufacturing efficiencies from capital investments in new facilities and cost reduction projects, including the benefit of ramping up our new yarn-spinning facilities; and thirdly, we currently expect better alignment between Printwear selling prices and cotton costs in calendar 2016.\r\nDue to our confidence in our outlook and long-term strategic growth drivers, we announced today that the Board has approved a 20% increase in our quarterly dividend. We've also announced that we have reinitiated a normal course issuer bid to repurchase up to 5% of our outstanding shares. We would consider a further increase in our share repurchase program if we believe that the long-term drivers of growth in our share value are not reflected in the stock price, while still continuing to pursue further complementary acquisitions. In order to ensure that we have financing flexibility to pursue acquisitions and undertake share repurchases, we have increased the amount available under our bank credit facility to $1 billion.\r\nIn summary, we are confident that we will regain a positive trajectory in EPS growth in the second half of calendar 2015 and that our businesses are well positioned for strong organic sales and earnings growth in 2016. In addition, we will continue to use our free cash flow and unused debt capacity to further increase our EPS growth and further enhance our returns in capital. We are confident that our pricing actions in Printwear will reinforce our strong leadership position in this business as in the past and that we will maintain attractive operating margins and returns in capital in this business, as a result of our continuing major investments in our vertical manufacturing and our commitment to our brand positioning and our customers, which we are reinforcing with our pricing actions today.\r\nAlso, we have continued and are continuing to generate strong momentum in our branding strategy in retail, with new retail programs, continuing market share gains and increasing brand equity and expect to continue to improve our operating margins, as we complete the integration of new retail products into our manufacturing and leverage our SG&A infrastructure with continued growth and sales revenues.\r\nBefore opening Q&A, we believe we are close to appointing a new CFO. The extra time has been helpful to Glenn, and our new CFO should be in place for our Q1 call. I will stay on after December 31 to support my successor and ensure a smooth transition of responsibilities.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Laurence. This concludes our formal remarks. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Operator, we're now ready to start the Q&A session.",

      "transcript_text3": "Laurence, I wondered if you could help me reconcile the conversation in terms of inventory and its impact on your realizing lower cotton costs. And I think what I'm trying to reconcile is, you had -- I think you highlighted inventory from $50 million higher than expected, but because of that, you would only be realizing lower cotton costs in the fourth calendar quarter. I'm just trying to reconcile the enormity of that gap against your normal hedging position and the fact that your sort of carry-on inventory wouldn't appear to sort of support a push of some 2 flat quarters on your realized cotton costs.\n\n---\n\nWhat I said is that we would be expecting to absolutely max out in our cotton costs in the fourth calendar quarter, but we expect to be in very good shape in the third quarter as well, in line with cotton futures, and our cotton costs will start to decline after the March quarter. We did cover cotton on the way down.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And just a follow-up on your commentary with respect to maintaining higher average inventory, going forward. Could you give us some sort of indication on that as to, was this year a reasonable proxy of what would be sort of higher average as a percent of sales? Or do you think that there's still further sort of increase to the upside looking forward by way of what will be your normalized inventory or commitment to inventory in any given year?\n\n---\n\nWell, this is Glenn. We're planning to have reduction of inventory this year, and the reduction's going to come to, obviously, reduction in costs and as well as reduction in some categories. But overall, I mean, our inventory is in line with our growth at the same time. As we exit this year and we increase our sales into '16, it will normalize inventory level that we need to upgrade on a go-forward basis. And it's definitely paying dividends in terms of our service and the ability to increase market share in both segments.\n\n---\n\nAre you able to provide me with some additional color on the various components of your $0.70 impact of pricing? Like how much of that did you give back in cotton? And how much is just, maybe perhaps, competitive action? Or is there anything on those lines?\n\n---\n\nI'm not sure if I really understand the question. But as we said on the call, the reduction in selling prices and the resulting distributor valuation is more driven by our anticipated manufacturing cost reductions that will generate from our capital investments and, particularly, the ramp-up of our yarn-spinning facilities more than declining cotton costs.\n\n---\n\nSo what we said is that the decrease in pricing in calendar '15 is $0.70 a share in Printwear, and we said that the cotton benefit is $0.35. And then as we go forward into calendar '16, of the $100 million of savings that we project in our manufacturing, we obtained about $25 million of those savings so far. The balance of those savings, the larger impact of them, will come from our yarn-spinning initiative and will be benefited in 2016. So when all those pieces align, that will sort of tell the tale in terms of our positioning in pricing and our cost position in the market.\n\n---\n\nAnd on the branded side, can you maybe highlight some new programs that you have in place, as you said, some of the ones you have secured for 2015 calendar year?\n\n---\n\nWell, right now, look here -- to start off with this, maybe just looking at the big pictures and the moving pieces is that based on the programs we obtained last year, about $50 million of that will be annualized or anniversaried in 2015. We have about $70 million of sales coming from the acquisition of Doris. And we have new confirmed programs of $120 million that will flow through in calendar '15, which are obviously greater in size and that's because that's a portion of a flow-through in our calendar '15. We've actually expanded and obtained programs in every category. We're expanding our underwear. We're expanding in socks, activewear, in all of our brands. We're getting expansion in Gildan, Gold Toe, even our secret Silks brands are expanding. And we've expanded our Mossy Oak license, which we've just now increased to genders, in which we are able to sell from socks and underwear to activewear and other product categories. And we've expanded the license agreement with Mossy Oak to have an exclusive for the next 10 years based on the performance and the commitment we're working together with the company. We're also expanding in every single channel of distribution, our Mossy's expanding, national counts, department stores and food and drug. And even in genders and not just in men's underwear, but we're expanding in other categories, like ladies and boys and girls. So all of our expansion plans, in terms of being a family brand, of a supplier in both -- all categories, we're seeing expansion. And the programs that we have in place, the $120 million, are really all in place today. We have a significant opportunity, we think, in terms of still obtaining new programs for calendar '15 that we're actively pursuing, and we're very excited about our momentum. And one other thing, I think, is important from our overall branding strategy, and particularly as we expand in our Gildan Gold Toe brands, is that we're making a major commitment to increase our advertising spend. And that's really not is part of it to support the existing programs, but it's really to support the future programs, which we are going to obtain as we go forward, and our commitment to build our brand strategy and position ourselves to be a leader in market share. We've seen huge growth in our underwear segment, I mean; we went from 0 to 6.5% from our first program launch through July. We're seeing continued improvement through this fourth quarter. Our market share in the end of September in underwear was 7.5%. We see another tick-up in market share in the 7.8%. We've expanded and doubled our production, during 2014, of our underwear. So we're well positioned both in inventory as well as manufacturing capacity to support future sales. And we have aspirations to see that market share continue to grow, through calendar 2015, in excess of 10%. So we're very excited about our whole retail branding strategy, and we're committed and we're all in.\n\n---\n\nJust wanted to just get a little more color around the deval that you took in the -- or that you'll be taking in the Printwear segment. And I just want to really get the sense of what was the driver of that? Was it -- was there a demand impact? Was demand slowing down? Was it sort of we're seeing pushback from distributors based on the cotton price declining?\n\n---\n\nWell, first of all, look here, we've always reinforced our leadership position in the channel. And our decision to deval was a combination of a couple of things: One is that we've realigned our discount structure and how we're going to market with our customers. The way we go to market today is that we have a price list and we have significant discounts that we offer customers that they need to obtain for various incentive programs that we have for them. And that discount structure has grown over the years and it's encouraged, really, lack of visibility in our customers' ability to plan their business, to manage their working capital. And it did well in its time, but right now we think it's time to actually change that and support them. This is something that we've worked with our customers and communicated with them as we've gone through this year and listening to them. And it's our commitment to reunite our leadership position and our support to them. We're combining this with, really, the strategy that's made Gildan successful is to reinvest and lever our low cost manufacturing position. We're making significant capital investments. We spent $300 million in '14. We're planning to spend $400 million approximately in the next 15 months. And these capital investments are basically allowing us to lower our costs, add value in our garments because there's a big part of that, while we're developing our whole ring-spun strategy and other product categories in our line. And what we have historically done is, pass these savings on to our customers and allowed us to benefit from gaining market share and making it difficult for competitors to energize in this industry. So we're very committed to making sure that we continue to drive our leadership position. We're not happy with our POS in Q4 and so far into the beginning of Q1. And we think that this is going to energize and allow us to continue to drive market share. As our yarn-spinning comes on next year, we're going to have a significant reduction on our cost structure. And as we align the future cotton, those elements are going to continue to give us very good returns in this division, as we go forward despite the reduction in pricing. Even in this calendar year, we're still going to have very good returns in our Printwear business.\n\n---\n\nOkay, and in terms of realigning the discount structure, is that something that was -- were you getting a lot of pushback from distributors about the current discount structure?\n\n---\n\nSorry, I don't understand his question.\n\n---\n\nWere distributors giving you a pushback on the client?\n\n---\n\nOur distributors, definitely, did not feel comfortable with the old discount structure. I think what we've done right now is more in line with what their aspirations are in terms of going forward and allowing them to be able to have more visibility in planning their business. One other key point is that now we have what we considered maybe more of an everyday low price so that they can actually determine what their mark-up structure needs to be, so they can better plan their business on a go-forward basis. At the same time, we think that it will make our brand and our customers more competitive in the industry.\n\n---\n\nCan you talk just switching up a little bit just to -- in regards to your guys' balance sheet? Are you going to be with the big capital investment, again, this year? Are you going to be free cash flow positive? And in terms of looking at potential acquisitions, what would be a comfortable leverage level that you'll be willing to carry?\n\n---\n\nWell, we'll use cash in the December quarter. In calendar 2015, we indicated on the script that we are going to generate very strong EBITDA, and that should result in very strong cash flows after the capital expenditures that we indicated. And we're also, in addition, looking at generating cash from the inventory reductions, including the impact on inventory volumes of our manufacturing cost reductions and lower cost cotton. So we should -- our strong EBITDA should translate into a very strong cash flow in calendar 2015. And we mentioned -- and add anything to this, but we mentioned that our uses of cash would be in addition to the increase in the dividend that we announced today. We will continue to explore further acquisitions that complement our organic growth strategies, and we've initiated a normal course issuer bid to repurchase shares.\n\n---\n\nOkay, and then can you maybe just comment on your comfort leverage level.\n\n---\n\nYes, we've always said that we're comfortable to go up to 2x or maybe a bit higher if we felt that we had good visibility on our free cash flow. So we're going to generate a lot of free cash flow, particularly once we finish our major investments in yarn-spinning. So even if we were to lever up beyond 2x, we'd have a lot of confidence in reducing our leverage very quickly based on our free cash flow generation.\n\n---\n\nOkay, great. And then just sorry, one more. Just on the retail pricing environment, I mean the price devaluation discounts you guys are implementing are on the Printwear. How do you see the retail pricing environment? Is it stable? Are you comfortable with current pricing level?\n\n---\n\nYes, our pricing in retail is still very aggressive out in the market. We're significantly priced under any of the other national brands and we're very comfortable with our position yet to date, and we're going to continue to drive market share. We're going to continue to price aggressively and we're very comfortable with continued expansion, new programs. I can't tell you how excited we are with our developments of our retail strategy. It's all coming together right now, and we're going to see major shelf space schemes as we go through in 2000 -- calendar '15.\n\n---\n\nJust on the strategic initiatives in Printwear, will the pricing reductions result in a permanent impairment in economics relatives to where you were prior? And then you require these ongoing efficiency initiatives to stabilize economic levels to where they were in the past? Is that the way to think about it?\n\n---\n\nThe whole basis for the pricing reductions was our anticipated manufacturing cost reductions of $100 million over 3 years that we projected. So based on these materials, significant manufacturing efficiencies, we expect to maintain very high returns in capital in Printwear, in line with our historical returns.\n\n---\n\nOkay, so the efficiency initiatives, we should think of them as covering the pricing initiatives and then you'll get some benefit as cotton declines as well?\n\n---\n\nThat's exactly it, and the fundamentals of the business have not changed. And one of the things I think that we'll -- that's important is that we're not stopping to invest in our low-cost manufacturing basically. We've committed to have $100 million of savings over the 3-year period, but we're continuing making other strategic investments to further enhance those savings and our low-cost manufacturing basis. So that's the strength of our company and we'll just take those savings and we'll reinvest part of them into better lower prices, better quality products for our customers in order to drive share, and we're very committed. We think that structurally, the division is in good form and operating margins will continue to be as good as they have in the past.\n\n---\n\nOkay. In terms of the buyback, just to be clear, you intend to execute on that?\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nOkay, so the entire 5%?\n\n---\n\nWell, I'm not going to commit to that, but we will definitely start to buy back.\n\n---\n\nOkay, and then just lastly, in terms of the cadence of ramp-up for these new facilities, that's unchanged, right?\n\n---\n\nUnchanged, yes. Everything's on track. We've completed reenhancing one expansion. We're in the process of building 6, which will come online in '16, and Costa Rica will come online on '17.\n\n---\n\nJust curious about the marketing cost commitment, what type of increase are you projecting there?\n\n---\n\nWell, the increase is pretty significant for us. It's in the range to about $10 million to $15 million. That's, we think, it's relative, and part of the increased marketing spend for us really is partly to support the programs we have now, but it's really to invest in the brand's future. A large portion of the spending is going to come from our Gildan initiative, and we think it's going to pay huge dividends, not only to support the sell-through of our existing products, but as well as to allow us to continue to generate more market share in every single one of our market segments as we go forward.\n\n---\n\nIs there some kind of pressure as you move into dealing more and more with the mass channel or larger accounts that you step up your marketing even further over the coming years?\n\n---\n\nNo. Look, I mean, like anything else, we invest in manufacturing, we're investing in our brands, and that's one great thing about our company is that we're always prepared to make investments for the long term, and I view this, and our company views this, as basically making a strategic investment to support our future opportunity. And as we lever our success, we will then build distribution and build our brand strength, and it's paying dividends and we're excited about the placements we have today. We have a lot of placements that we think that we're going to obtain during the course of this year that are not in our forecast, and we're going to continue to drive success in our brand group.\n\n---\n\nOkay, and you mentioned in the remarks in the release about a bit of a softening of demand. Could you characterize that in terms of product categories of Printwear versus branded et cetera?\n\n---\n\nWell, I think in both cases, I mean our POS in Printwear was softer than we wanted it to be, to be perfectly honest with you, and that some part of our rationale is to continue to look at ways to increase our unit volume, which we think we will accomplish through our new structure and pricing initiatives and structure as we go forward into the channel. Our retail environment, back-to-school wasn't robust. We performed well in our POS. I mean the fact is that our market share has gone up pretty good over the last 3, 4 months, so but overall, the retail climate has not been robust. Black Friday was mixed. Mass was up. I mean we've done again very well, I think, in the products that we sell, but it's not as robust, obviously as it should be. You can see that from the retailers and the ones that have given guidance in earnings. I mean, so -- but the most important thing, I think, from our perspective is that we're taking share. Our share is going up. We're getting new programs and we are very excited about the opportunity in 2015, and we're continuing to look for new programs that we haven't obtained yet. And we're not just getting our programs and our shelf space from the existing customers; we're getting new programs from new customers in all product categories. So we're expanding our brand strength, both Gold Toe, our Gildan brand, our Mossy brands, we're expanding in every single channel of distribution in all segments, all genders, so we're very excited about the outcome and as we go forward into calendar '15.\n\n---\n\nAnd last question if I may, just price gaps in some of your key categories in branded. How do you see them versus some of your key competitors? Have they expanded, tightened up with or without promotional activity?\n\n---\n\nWell, I mean in back-to-school, there definitely was promotional activity and pricing action from our competitors, but the good news is that we continue to take market share, and that I think is really from our case is the most exciting thing about our whole retail strategy is that we've been typically priced relatively aggressive against our competitors. And during back-to-school, I would say that our competitors, our pricing actions were probably aggressive, but we still grew share, which is the power of our brand, the quality of our products, and we're really excited and this is what's leading us to new opportunities and more market share gains.\n\n---\n\nThis is Chad on for Taposh. My first question is on the price cut again. I guess I wanted to get a sense; obviously you're not happy with the POS. Are these price cuts defensive in any way? What are you guys seeing in the competitive environment? Because you're obviously the market share leader here. So if you could touch on that that will be really helpful.\n\n---\n\nWell, we'll look at -- I mean, the deval and the reason why we are going to market is strategic in nature and reinforcing our leadership position with our customers and making it easier for our customers to do business and have more visibility. So that's part of it. The second part is that like I said earlier is that our POS is just not what we want it to be, and the way we go to market today, by having a higher price, let's say, for example, allows for, I would say, people to make deals other mills in our products, let's say our competitors, actually to move and cut deals with other customers and what we're doing is, we're actually taking our price down to an everyday low price. So we flush anything out of the market that people can afford to do. So what's going to end up happening is that our pricing actions are going to -- they're aggressive and they will allow our customers to have an everyday low price with our products, but it will deter any competitor from trying to undercut our pricing strategy in the market. At the same time, as we continue to make our investments in yarn-spinning and other manufacturing efficiencies, we can afford to be more price aggressive and to continue to take -- to consolidate or to take share of the market, and we feel comfortable with that. We will continue to see a trajectory in growth, not only in probably our basic category, which has the largest decrease in price, but also as we reinvest in our technology and our yarn-spinning and the new products that we're bringing to market. We're also looking at enhancing our sales through new product extensions, our Anvil brand. So it's not just one-dimensional. It's really -- what we're doing is we're making sure in the basics segment that we're priced to win and then we're reinvesting our low-cost manufacturing to support product expansion and innovation for our customers to give them a full package and to really develop our brand strength within the channel. And just one last thing, I think, is also is that at the same time, reinforcing our position as well in all the other markets, our international businesses have grown by 20% this year. We're growing significantly in Latin America. We're expanding and adding product in Europe, and our Asian business, basically is growing at a much greater clip. So we're continuing not just to focus on our U.S. market. But our U.S. market is our largest market, and we are reinforcing our leadership position here. And we will lead in every one of the markets in Gildan sales again.\n\n---\n\nThat's helpful. One follow-up just on the Doris acquisition, is there anything embedded in the guidance in terms of the expansion of the Gildan brand into retail in Canada?\n\n---\n\nThere's nothing in our guidance except for the historical sales of Doris, but through the Doris acquisition, we believe that we will have significant new opportunities for us as we go forward that are not embedded in our guidance today. And that's -- maybe just to qualify that, that's going to be an expanding share into the U.S., expanding their brand strategy and other product segments, and as well as developing and driving our existing Gold Toe and Gildan brands into Canada.\n\n---\n\nJust a couple of questions in terms of 2015 guidance. Is there any sort of share count reduction factored into the 2015 guidance provided? And then additionally, the $125 million in new programs that you talked about that's less than the annualized rate, is that sort of a half-year contribution and 9-month contribution, what's the magnitude there? And then lastly, you talked about the potential for unconfirmed programs. Could that be material given your capacity ramp?\n\n---\n\nAs far as share repurchases, what's included in there is negligible, a couple of pennies from some immediate actions that we're planning to take. Could you go through the other questions?\n\n---\n\nYes, sorry, can you please repeat your other 2 questions again.\n\n---\n\nSorry, in terms of their new programs that are confirmed for 2015, $125 million impact, didn't know if you could characterize that as half-year contribution or 9-month contribution, what the full annualized benefit of those new programs would be? Secondly, the unconfirmed programs, given your capacity ramp, could that be material for 2015 if you do get more unconfirmed programs?\n\n---\n\nWell, I would say that typically both 70% of the programs we get in here, so I would say that of the $120 million, that would represent annualizing their 70% of the total annualized opportunity. And as far as the unconfirmed, look, we don't want to speculate on things we don't have today. That's why we don't put it in our guidance, but we have the capacity to support, obviously, and the inventory to support additional programs, both in branded as well if our Printwear POS exceeds our expectations, we have room to advance our sales opportunity through these 2 avenues. So we're going to be very aggressive to pursue new programs. We're committed to driving the strategy. All of the stars are aligned are in place, and we're making the right investments, not just in our manufacturing, but we're investing in our brand strategies and we think that the capacity is in place, and hopefully, we'll achieve and exceed the sales guidance.\n\n---\n\nAnd then just a quick question in terms of Printwear market share, I'm not sure if you're willing to provide current, but either way, in terms of with the price changes, is there a potential for material market share gains from current levels? In your order of your priorities when making this decision, how important was market share gains in that decision?\n\n---\n\nWe look at the overall market, and one of the things that we're going to do is by having our price strategy the way we structure it today, one of the things that we're going to benefit from is allowing our distributors to reach out to markets that they weren't able to reach out to before, and that's a fundamental change I would say a little bit, because they're going to be more competitively priced with our products, and there are other factors and other competitors outside of our distributor channel today that we've always measured. So now our customers are going to have a product and a price from Gildan really to reach out to new customers they weren't able to reach out to before. So indirectly, that should increase our share with our existing customers; provide them with better earnings power and better sales, so it becomes a win-win. It's win for them and win for us.\n\n---\n\nJust a few follow-ups. I wonder if you could just talk a bit about the manufacturing efficiencies. The $100 million and what you expect to achieve in '15. And then how much is still to come in '16? I understand the yarn-spinning isn't until '16, but if you could just put some dollar numbers on it, that will be great.\n\n---\n\nWe're going to have about $25 million of the $100 million are going through in that '15, and then of the balance, a large portion of that will flow through in '16, and then the balance of that will go through into '17. The majority of the savings we have so far are from the energy projects and other things that we've invested in, and the big yarn-spinning initiative will really impact us in '16 and the balance in '17.\n\n---\n\nSo the yarn-spinning is really sort of a flip of the switch at the end of '15.\n\n---\n\nRight now, we've -- what's happened in yarn-spinning is that we've ramped up 100% our Salisbury 1 ring-spun plant. We modernized our 2 other facilities which is Clarkton and Cedartown. That's what we did this year, but the major new capital investments that are really going to drive the savings for us is our Salisbury 2 plant, which is the largest yarn facility, probably in the world. It's being ramped up as we speak and will be fully ramped up over the next, probably, 6 to 7, 8 months. And then our Mocksville plant, which is going to be probably one of the largest ring-spun plants, is going to be started in our calendar first quarter, and basically be ramped up through '15. So both these initiatives are going to make a major impact on our cost structure, and as well as allow us to continue to add value in our garments and drive our sales in ring-spun yarns, for example, as we go forward into the future.\n\n---\n\nSorry, and which one is ring-spun? Are they both ring-spun? Or is one open-end, one is ring-spun.\n\n---\n\nYes, well Salisbury 2 is -- Salisbury 1 is ring-spun. Salisbury 2 is an open-end facility, and our Mocksville facility is going to be the largest ring-spun facility in this hemisphere.\n\n---\n\nOn the CapEx side, Glenn, can you, just maybe in broad terms, talk to us about just the discipline you have given you're in the middle of a multi-year CapEx program that's the biggest in the company's history to see the dollars invested well? And then also, I think, so you mentioned the $250 million to $300 million being mostly the balance on the textile facilities, but then Laurence, in your comment, you talked about possibly new energy savings programs. So how much is there may be a lot for energy savings programs that you may not have really spoken to yet?\n\n---\n\nThe large part of our capital is in yarn-spinning as well as -- I mean the big projects that we mentioned are the yarn-spinning projects. We're expanding our 2 major new initiatives in textiles, which is Rio Nance 6 in Costa Rica. We're expanding our distribution centers in the United States and in Eden. At the same time, we're investing in energy, and with that energy position, it's completing the programs that we have put together in terms of our biomass and also part of our electrical saving program that we put together, but the bulk of the savings, the bulk of the investment is going to be in yarn-spinning and textiles. I'd say it would be the bulk of the capital that we're going to be investing in from this point on.\n\n---\n\nOkay, great. And then on the Branded Apparel side, I was hoping that you could maybe help me with what would be the private label mix exiting calendar '15? And then you mentioned the $10 million to $15 million of marketing spend. If I put roughly a 12% SG&A rate on the $2.65 billion, it looks more like $35 million incremental SG&A. So maybe Laurence, can you talk to where the balance is going?\n\n---\n\nSG&A, he wants to know balance of the SG&A.\n\n---\n\nSorry, I must have not understand the question.\n\n---\n\nIf you're going to have a similar rate of say, 12% SG&A rate, and your guidance is $2.65 billion. The difference that I'm coming to is around $35 million year-over-year, and there's $10 million to $15 million earmarked for marketing.\n\n---\n\nThere's the Doris acquisition and we paid low bonuses issue, there was lower incentive compensation this year that would be more normal next year.\n\n---\n\nOkay, and private label mix exiting 2015 in terms of the portion of Branded Apparel.\n\n---\n\nYes. Look, as far as the private label is down 15%, probably will be our rate. Look at our focus is to divest ourselves at private label, and part of that also is we have stopped selling one of our licenses, we gave up a license that we had in one of -- and in socks under the new balance license, but our whole focus is obviously to continue driving our brand strategy, and we basically are pushing to sell Gildan and Gold Toe products, so we've given up some private label.\n\n---\n\nOkay, if I can sneak one more in. Laurence, you used to give a sensitivity of a 1% change in Printwear pricing. Do you have a number like that today?\n\n---\n\nWell it's 1% of the Printwear sales.\n\n---\n\nAre you talking about pricing, or are you talking about cotton. What are you talking about? Pricing?\n\n---\n\n1% change in Printwear price, the EPS impact of that. I think the last time it was around $0.11 or so...\n\n---\n\nYes. So today we're more like $0.15 today.\n\n---\n\nThis is Jarrod Feinstein on for David Glick. Can you help us bridge the gap between the consensus EPS of $0.42 for Q1 and the $0.30 loss that you're looking for? And maybe the inventory devaluations is like $45 million, I believe. So if you could break out the balance of the difference, how much is marketing, how much is price reduction, manufacturing efficiencies et cetera?\n\n---\n\nOkay, well, the deval, as you mentioned, is $45 million. We also mentioned the Printwear destocking, which is about $0.10. The impact of higher cost cotton and the consumption of inventories with the transitional manufacturing inefficiencies between the two of them that would be another $0.10. SG&A, including the brand advertising and marketing to support holiday sales would be, maybe $0.03 or $0.04. And then on the positive side, we have growth in Branded Apparel sales volumes and the accretive impact of Doris. So these are the positives that will drive the Branded Apparel growth in earnings in the December quarter.\n\n---\n\nA couple of questions. Glenn, if cotton cost go higher, could the Printwear market accept the price increase?\n\n---\n\nWell look, I mean, we didn't -- our pricing actions are really not a function of cotton and that's a byproduct of it. I mean right now, we're focusing on changing our discount structure to our customers and driving our low-cost manufacturing. I mean, obviously, cotton is a big component of our cost of goods sold. And if it was going to be materially going up, I mean there would definitely prices would follow in the future, but really, that's not the driving force behind what's made our decision to be more aggressive on price?\n\n---\n\nOkay, and then Glenn, what's the probability that new CFO comes in, has a different view of margin structure and feels the need to take a more conservative view on the outlook?\n\n---\n\nWell, I mean the margin structure of our company is still very successful. I mean I think that even despite our pricing actions, we're getting returns probably in one of the best returns in the whole apparel segment as a company if you look at our forecast for calendar '15. So I think he's going to be pretty happy working for a company that is growing its top line sales at the rate we are, is investing heavily in manufacturing and investing in their brand strategy and still making these huge returns, generating huge amounts of cash flow, great place to come to work. We're on the -- once we're on the winning team come work to Gildan, that's the way I would look at it.\n\n---\n\nWell, that make sense. But this -- I guess, so I interpret this, this is Laurence's guidance, is it also your guidance, and you're going to stand behind this?\n\n---\n\nThis is my guidance and I am the one who...\n\n---\n\nI work for him.\n\n---\n\nHe works for me and I'm fully responsible for making the strategies, same as strategies in the company, same as strategy in our pricing, working with our branded group and our advertising, making our capital investments. There's probably not a CEO in our industry as is involved in the day-to-day operations as I am. So I stand 150% behind our guidance. I'm committed to delivering the guidance to the market, not myself. The metric was down to every one of the Gildan employees. It's a team effort here at Gildan, and everybody wants to be on the winning team, so we're excited about the future, and one thing for sure is that we're never scared to make the decisions to drive the long-term shareholder value. I am a shareholder of the company. I still have a significant stake in stock in this company, and I'm committed to making sure that we succeed in the future and that all the employees of Gildan are successful and happy working in our organization.\n\n---\n\nSorry, if you said this already, what is your 3% sales target for Printwear implied in terms of unit volume growth for calendar '15?\n\n---\n\nWell, I don't want to give that, but I can tell you, look, we said we had about $0.70 decline in pricing, and our unit growth is 3, so you can sort of do the math.\n\n---\n\nOkay, okay that's fine. And my second question is you mentioned you're going to see about $0.35 of EPS benefit from lower cotton cost in calendar '15, but it's only partial because you're still cycling through some hard cost inventory. If you assume cotton sort of stays where it is right now, what will be the incremental EPS benefit in calendar '16? Should we think like it's going to be higher than $0.35?\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nOkay, that's fine for now.\n\n---\n\nAnd just to go back to the first part of your question, we mentioned in the call that our projected impact of higher volume between the 2 divisions on our guidance for calendar -- our earnings, projected earnings growth in calendar 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 is $0.60 a share. So we're looking for good growth in Printwear as well as in, of course, Branded Apparel.\n\n---\n\nI have just a few follow-up questions. Just on that cotton question with respect to '16, is it fair to say that $0.35 benefit that you get in the back half of '15, you should get another $0.35 benefit in '16 assuming cotton prices stay constant?\n\n---\n\nYes, that's math.\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nOkay. That's fine. And then in terms of last year when we were down 100 as we talked about global lifestyle of major customers and potential for $400 million to $500 million incremental revenue over the next 3 to 5 years, and I wondered if we're progressing as planned on that front.\n\n---\n\nYes we are, we're growing that business, it's projected to be up about 25% next year.\n\n---\n\nFair enough. And then, Glenn, just last question in terms of acquisitions. You've said for a few quarters now it's a strategic priority. You've increased your credit facilities you have for the NCIB and potential acquisitions. Is it fair to say that an acquisition, it's a necessity rather than an option just to enhance your brand position just based on your relevant size?\n\n---\n\nNo. I would not say that. I think that where we are today, we can grow significantly in every single one of the categories. I mean, we've made a huge investment over the last couple of years in building our brands and our distribution, our relationship with our customers. So there's a lot of opportunity for us for organic growth. I mean you can see this year we have a lot of organic growth in the tune of over 20 something percent 23%, 24% of just organic growth, but still the possibility is to obtain new programs that which haven't solidified yet. So our organic opportunity, and that is continuing to accelerate because as we get more placement and our stronger brand presence, we're going to continue to grow organically, because the market is so large in branded, there's a huge opportunity in house. Saying that, we did an acquisition with Doris. Although the acquisition is relatively small, it's opening up huge doors for us. It's giving us doors in the U.S. where we're going to place shear, and it's not just going in and, let's say, for example, saying I got shear, it's actually signed a full product category to our customers, which allows them to have more confidence in growing the other things that we really want to grow like our underwear and our socks and our activewear products. So the acquisitions don't have to be large in size. They have to be strategic in nature, and I think that's the key. So it's got to be something that will give us a product category, a brand strategy, a channel of distribution, a new market. I mean we're always going to be very tactical about how we approach acquisitions. We don't want to do acquisitions just for the sake of looking for top line growth, because we think we can do that with better returns by driving organic sales, and we can't just by buying companies for top line sales so everything is strategic. And I think so far if you look at every one in the acquisitions, we've done over the last 5, 6 years basically, that is sort of our MO. So we're continuing to look. We obviously have some things that we continue to look at, but nothing is embedded in our guidance today, and we're excited about our balance sheet and the ability for us to continue to look at these opportunities.\n\n---\n\nMy questions have all been answered.\n\n---\n\nThank you, everyone, once again for joining us. This concludes our call today, and of course, we look forward to speaking to you very soon and we'd also like to wish you the very best for the holiday season. Have a great day.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Kenric Tyghe (Analysts)】\nLaurence, I wondered if you could help me reconcile the conversation in terms of inventory and its impact on your realizing lower cotton costs. And I think what I'm trying to reconcile is, you had -- I think you highlighted inventory from $50 million higher than expected, but because of that, you would only be realizing lower cotton costs in the fourth calendar quarter. I'm just trying to reconcile the enormity of that gap against your normal hedging position and the fact that your sort of carry-on inventory wouldn't appear to sort of support a push of some 2 flat quarters on your realized cotton costs.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Sellyn (Executives)】\nWhat I said is that we would be expecting to absolutely max out in our cotton costs in the fourth calendar quarter, but we expect to be in very good shape in the third quarter as well, in line with cotton futures, and our cotton costs will start to decline after the March quarter. We did cover cotton on the way down.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kenric Tyghe (Analysts)】\nGreat. And just a follow-up on your commentary with respect to maintaining higher average inventory, going forward. Could you give us some sort of indication on that as to, was this year a reasonable proxy of what would be sort of higher average as a percent of sales? Or do you think that there's still further sort of increase to the upside looking forward by way of what will be your normalized inventory or commitment to inventory in any given year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Glenn Chamandy (Executives)】\nWell, this is Glenn. We're planning to have reduction of inventory this year, and the reduction's going to come to, obviously, reduction in costs and as well as reduction in some categories. But overall, I mean, our inventory is in line with our growth at the same time. As we exit this year and we increase our sales into '16, it will normalize inventory level that we need to upgrade on a go-forward basis. And it's definitely paying dividends in terms of our service and the ability to increase market share in both segments.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sabahat Khan (Analysts)】\nAre you able to provide me with some additional color on the various components of your $0.70 impact of pricing? Like how much of that did you give back in cotton? And how much is just, maybe perhaps, competitive action? Or is there anything on those lines?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Sellyn (Executives)】\nI'm not sure if I really understand the question. But as we said on the call, the reduction in selling prices and the resulting distributor valuation is more driven by our anticipated manufacturing cost reductions that will generate from our capital investments and, particularly, the ramp-up of our yarn-spinning facilities more than declining cotton costs.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Glenn Chamandy (Executives)】\nSo what we said is that the decrease in pricing in calendar '15 is $0.70 a share in Printwear, and we said that the cotton benefit is $0.35. And then as we go forward into calendar '16, of the $100 million of savings that we project in our manufacturing, we obtained about $25 million of those savings so far. The balance of those savings, the larger impact of them, will come from our yarn-spinning initiative and will be benefited in 2016. So when all those pieces align, that will sort of tell the tale in terms of our positioning in pricing and our cost position in the market.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sabahat Khan (Analysts)】\nAnd on the branded side, can you maybe highlight some new programs that you have in place, as you said, some of the ones you have secured for 2015 calendar year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Glenn Chamandy (Executives)】\nWell, right now, look here -- to start off with this, maybe just looking at the big pictures and the moving pieces is that based on the programs we obtained last year, about $50 million of that will be annualized or anniversaried in 2015. We have about $70 million of sales coming from the acquisition of Doris. And we have new confirmed programs of $120 million that will flow through in calendar '15, which are obviously greater in size and that's because that's a portion of a flow-through in our calendar '15. We've actually expanded and obtained programs in every category. We're expanding our underwear. We're expanding in socks, activewear, in all of our brands. We're getting expansion in Gildan, Gold Toe, even our secret Silks brands are expanding. And we've expanded our Mossy Oak license, which we've just now increased to genders, in which we are able to sell from socks and underwear to activewear and other product categories. And we've expanded the license agreement with Mossy Oak to have an exclusive for the next 10 years based on the performance and the commitment we're working together with the company. We're also expanding in every single channel of distribution, our Mossy's expanding, national counts, department stores and food and drug. And even in genders and not just in men's underwear, but we're expanding in other categories, like ladies and boys and girls. So all of our expansion plans, in terms of being a family brand, of a supplier in both -- all categories, we're seeing expansion. And the programs that we have in place, the $120 million, are really all in place today. We have a significant opportunity, we think, in terms of still obtaining new programs for calendar '15 that we're actively pursuing, and we're very excited about our momentum. And one other thing, I think, is important from our overall branding strategy, and particularly as we expand in our Gildan Gold Toe brands, is that we're making a major commitment to increase our advertising spend. And that's really not is part of it to support the existing programs, but it's really to support the future programs, which we are going to obtain as we go forward, and our commitment to build our brand strategy and position ourselves to be a leader in market share. We've seen huge growth in our underwear segment, I mean; we went from 0 to 6.5% from our first program launch through July. We're seeing continued improvement through this fourth quarter. Our market share in the end of September in underwear was 7.5%. We see another tick-up in market share in the 7.8%. We've expanded and doubled our production, during 2014, of our underwear. So we're well positioned both in inventory as well as manufacturing capacity to support future sales. And we have aspirations to see that market share continue to grow, through calendar 2015, in excess of 10%. So we're very excited about our whole retail branding strategy, and we're committed and we're all in.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Stephen MacLeod (Analysts)】\nJust wanted to just get a little more color around the deval that you took in the -- or that you'll be taking in the Printwear segment. And I just want to really get the sense of what was the driver of that? Was it -- was there a demand impact? Was demand slowing down? Was it sort of we're seeing pushback from distributors based on the cotton price declining?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Glenn Chamandy (Executives)】\nWell, first of all, look here, we've always reinforced our leadership position in the channel. And our decision to deval was a combination of a couple of things: One is that we've realigned our discount structure and how we're going to market with our customers. The way we go to market today is that we have a price list and we have significant discounts that we offer customers that they need to obtain for various incentive programs that we have for them. And that discount structure has grown over the years and it's encouraged, really, lack of visibility in our customers' ability to plan their business, to manage their working capital. And it did well in its time, but right now we think it's time to actually change that and support them. This is something that we've worked with our customers and communicated with them as we've gone through this year and listening to them. And it's our commitment to reunite our leadership position and our support to them. We're combining this with, really, the strategy that's made Gildan successful is to reinvest and lever our low cost manufacturing position. We're making significant capital investments. We spent $300 million in '14. We're planning to spend $400 million approximately in the next 15 months. And these capital investments are basically allowing us to lower our costs, add value in our garments because there's a big part of that, while we're developing our whole ring-spun strategy and other product categories in our line. And what we have historically done is, pass these savings on to our customers and allowed us to benefit from gaining market share and making it difficult for competitors to energize in this industry. So we're very committed to making sure that we continue to drive our leadership position. We're not happy with our POS in Q4 and so far into the beginning of Q1. And we think that this is going to energize and allow us to continue to drive market share. As our yarn-spinning comes on next year, we're going to have a significant reduction on our cost structure. And as we align the future cotton, those elements are going to continue to give us very good returns in this division, as we go forward despite the reduction in pricing. Even in this calendar year, we're still going to have very good returns in our Printwear business.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Stephen MacLeod (Analysts)】\nOkay, and in terms of realigning the discount structure, is that something that was -- were you getting a lot of pushback from distributors about the current discount structure?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Sellyn (Executives)】\nSorry, I don't understand his question.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Sophie Argiriou (Executives)】\nWere distributors giving you a pushback on the client?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Glenn Chamandy (Executives)】\nOur distributors, definitely, did not feel comfortable with the old discount structure. I think what we've done right now is more in line with what their aspirations are in terms of going forward and allowing them to be able to have more visibility in planning their business. One other key point is that now we have what we considered maybe more of an everyday low price so that they can actually determine what their mark-up structure needs to be, so they can better plan their business on a go-forward basis. At the same time, we think that it will make our brand and our customers more competitive in the industry.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Derek Dley (Analysts)】\nCan you talk just switching up a little bit just to -- in regards to your guys' balance sheet? Are you going to be with the big capital investment, again, this year? Are you going to be free cash flow positive? And in terms of looking at potential acquisitions, what would be a comfortable leverage level that you'll be willing to carry?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Sellyn (Executives)】\nWell, we'll use cash in the December quarter. In calendar 2015, we indicated on the script that we are going to generate very strong EBITDA, and that should result in very strong cash flows after the capital expenditures that we indicated. And we're also, in addition, looking at generating cash from the inventory reductions, including the impact on inventory volumes of our manufacturing cost reductions and lower cost cotton. So we should -- our strong EBITDA should translate into a very strong cash flow in calendar 2015. And we mentioned -- and add anything to this, but we mentioned that our uses of cash would be in addition to the increase in the dividend that we announced today. We will continue to explore further acquisitions that complement our organic growth strategies, and we've initiated a normal course issuer bid to repurchase shares.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Derek Dley (Analysts)】\nOkay, and then can you maybe just comment on your comfort leverage level.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Sellyn (Executives)】\nYes, we've always said that we're comfortable to go up to 2x or maybe a bit higher if we felt that we had good visibility on our free cash flow. So we're going to generate a lot of free cash flow, particularly once we finish our major investments in yarn-spinning. So even if we were to lever up beyond 2x, we'd have a lot of confidence in reducing our leverage very quickly based on our free cash flow generation.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Derek Dley (Analysts)】\nOkay, great. And then just sorry, one more. Just on the retail pricing environment, I mean the price devaluation discounts you guys are implementing are on the Printwear. How do you see the retail pricing environment? Is it stable? Are you comfortable with current pricing level?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Glenn Chamandy (Executives)】\nYes, our pricing in retail is still very aggressive out in the market. We're significantly priced under any of the other national brands and we're very comfortable with our position yet to date, and we're going to continue to drive market share. We're going to continue to price aggressively and we're very comfortable with continued expansion, new programs. I can't tell you how excited we are with our developments of our retail strategy. It's all coming together right now, and we're going to see major shelf space schemes as we go through in 2000 -- calendar '15.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Vishal Shreedhar (Analysts)】\nJust on the strategic initiatives in Printwear, will the pricing reductions result in a permanent impairment in economics relatives to where you were prior? And then you require these ongoing efficiency initiatives to stabilize economic levels to where they were in the past? Is that the way to think about it?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Sellyn (Executives)】\nThe whole basis for the pricing reductions was our anticipated manufacturing cost reductions of $100 million over 3 years that we projected. So based on these materials, significant manufacturing efficiencies, we expect to maintain very high returns in capital in Printwear, in line with our historical returns.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Vishal Shreedhar (Analysts)】\nOkay, so the efficiency initiatives, we should think of them as covering the pricing initiatives and then you'll get some benefit as cotton declines as well?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Glenn Chamandy (Executives)】\nThat's exactly it, and the fundamentals of the business have not changed. And one of the things I think that we'll -- that's important is that we're not stopping to invest in our low-cost manufacturing basically. We've committed to have $100 million of savings over the 3-year period, but we're continuing making other strategic investments to further enhance those savings and our low-cost manufacturing basis. So that's the strength of our company and we'll just take those savings and we'll reinvest part of them into better lower prices, better quality products for our customers in order to drive share, and we're very committed. We think that structurally, the division is in good form and operating margins will continue to be as good as they have in the past.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Vishal Shreedhar (Analysts)】\nOkay. In terms of the buyback, just to be clear, you intend to execute on that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Glenn Chamandy (Executives)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Vishal Shreedhar (Analysts)】\nOkay, so the entire 5%?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Glenn Chamandy (Executives)】\nWell, I'm not going to commit to that, but we will definitely start to buy back.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Vishal Shreedhar (Analysts)】\nOkay, and then just lastly, in terms of the cadence of ramp-up for these new facilities, that's unchanged, right?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Glenn Chamandy (Executives)】\nUnchanged, yes. Everything's on track. We've completed reenhancing one expansion. We're in the process of building 6, which will come online in '16, and Costa Rica will come online on '17.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Hartley (Analysts)】\nJust curious about the marketing cost commitment, what type of increase are you projecting there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Glenn Chamandy (Executives)】\nWell, the increase is pretty significant for us. It's in the range to about $10 million to $15 million. That's, we think, it's relative, and part of the increased marketing spend for us really is partly to support the programs we have now, but it's really to invest in the brand's future. A large portion of the spending is going to come from our Gildan initiative, and we think it's going to pay huge dividends, not only to support the sell-through of our existing products, but as well as to allow us to continue to generate more market share in every single one of our market segments as we go forward.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Hartley (Analysts)】\nIs there some kind of pressure as you move into dealing more and more with the mass channel or larger accounts that you step up your marketing even further over the coming years?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Glenn Chamandy (Executives)】\nNo. Look, I mean, like anything else, we invest in manufacturing, we're investing in our brands, and that's one great thing about our company is that we're always prepared to make investments for the long term, and I view this, and our company views this, as basically making a strategic investment to support our future opportunity. And as we lever our success, we will then build distribution and build our brand strength, and it's paying dividends and we're excited about the placements we have today. We have a lot of placements that we think that we're going to obtain during the course of this year that are not in our forecast, and we're going to continue to drive success in our brand group.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Hartley (Analysts)】\nOkay, and you mentioned in the remarks in the release about a bit of a softening of demand. Could you characterize that in terms of product categories of Printwear versus branded et cetera?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Glenn Chamandy (Executives)】\nWell, I think in both cases, I mean our POS in Printwear was softer than we wanted it to be, to be perfectly honest with you, and that some part of our rationale is to continue to look at ways to increase our unit volume, which we think we will accomplish through our new structure and pricing initiatives and structure as we go forward into the channel. Our retail environment, back-to-school wasn't robust. We performed well in our POS. I mean the fact is that our market share has gone up pretty good over the last 3, 4 months, so but overall, the retail climate has not been robust. Black Friday was mixed. Mass was up. I mean we've done again very well, I think, in the products that we sell, but it's not as robust, obviously as it should be. You can see that from the retailers and the ones that have given guidance in earnings. I mean, so -- but the most important thing, I think, from our perspective is that we're taking share. Our share is going up. We're getting new programs and we are very excited about the opportunity in 2015, and we're continuing to look for new programs that we haven't obtained yet. And we're not just getting our programs and our shelf space from the existing customers; we're getting new programs from new customers in all product categories. So we're expanding our brand strength, both Gold Toe, our Gildan brand, our Mossy brands, we're expanding in every single channel of distribution in all segments, all genders, so we're very excited about the outcome and as we go forward into calendar '15.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Hartley (Analysts)】\nAnd last question if I may, just price gaps in some of your key categories in branded. How do you see them versus some of your key competitors? Have they expanded, tightened up with or without promotional activity?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Glenn Chamandy (Executives)】\nWell, I mean in back-to-school, there definitely was promotional activity and pricing action from our competitors, but the good news is that we continue to take market share, and that I think is really from our case is the most exciting thing about our whole retail strategy is that we've been typically priced relatively aggressive against our competitors. And during back-to-school, I would say that our competitors, our pricing actions were probably aggressive, but we still grew share, which is the power of our brand, the quality of our products, and we're really excited and this is what's leading us to new opportunities and more market share gains.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chad Sutherland (Analysts)】\nThis is Chad on for Taposh. My first question is on the price cut again. I guess I wanted to get a sense; obviously you're not happy with the POS. Are these price cuts defensive in any way? What are you guys seeing in the competitive environment? Because you're obviously the market share leader here. So if you could touch on that that will be really helpful.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Glenn Chamandy (Executives)】\nWell, we'll look at -- I mean, the deval and the reason why we are going to market is strategic in nature and reinforcing our leadership position with our customers and making it easier for our customers to do business and have more visibility. So that's part of it. The second part is that like I said earlier is that our POS is just not what we want it to be, and the way we go to market today, by having a higher price, let's say, for example, allows for, I would say, people to make deals other mills in our products, let's say our competitors, actually to move and cut deals with other customers and what we're doing is, we're actually taking our price down to an everyday low price. So we flush anything out of the market that people can afford to do. So what's going to end up happening is that our pricing actions are going to -- they're aggressive and they will allow our customers to have an everyday low price with our products, but it will deter any competitor from trying to undercut our pricing strategy in the market. At the same time, as we continue to make our investments in yarn-spinning and other manufacturing efficiencies, we can afford to be more price aggressive and to continue to take -- to consolidate or to take share of the market, and we feel comfortable with that. We will continue to see a trajectory in growth, not only in probably our basic category, which has the largest decrease in price, but also as we reinvest in our technology and our yarn-spinning and the new products that we're bringing to market. We're also looking at enhancing our sales through new product extensions, our Anvil brand. So it's not just one-dimensional. It's really -- what we're doing is we're making sure in the basics segment that we're priced to win and then we're reinvesting our low-cost manufacturing to support product expansion and innovation for our customers to give them a full package and to really develop our brand strength within the channel. And just one last thing, I think, is also is that at the same time, reinforcing our position as well in all the other markets, our international businesses have grown by 20% this year. We're growing significantly in Latin America. We're expanding and adding product in Europe, and our Asian business, basically is growing at a much greater clip. So we're continuing not just to focus on our U.S. market. But our U.S. market is our largest market, and we are reinforcing our leadership position here. And we will lead in every one of the markets in Gildan sales again.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chad Sutherland (Analysts)】\nThat's helpful. One follow-up just on the Doris acquisition, is there anything embedded in the guidance in terms of the expansion of the Gildan brand into retail in Canada?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Glenn Chamandy (Executives)】\nThere's nothing in our guidance except for the historical sales of Doris, but through the Doris acquisition, we believe that we will have significant new opportunities for us as we go forward that are not embedded in our guidance today. And that's -- maybe just to qualify that, that's going to be an expanding share into the U.S., expanding their brand strategy and other product segments, and as well as developing and driving our existing Gold Toe and Gildan brands into Canada.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Burns (Analysts)】\nJust a couple of questions in terms of 2015 guidance. Is there any sort of share count reduction factored into the 2015 guidance provided? And then additionally, the $125 million in new programs that you talked about that's less than the annualized rate, is that sort of a half-year contribution and 9-month contribution, what's the magnitude there? And then lastly, you talked about the potential for unconfirmed programs. Could that be material given your capacity ramp?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Sellyn (Executives)】\nAs far as share repurchases, what's included in there is negligible, a couple of pennies from some immediate actions that we're planning to take. Could you go through the other questions?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Glenn Chamandy (Executives)】\nYes, sorry, can you please repeat your other 2 questions again.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Burns (Analysts)】\nSorry, in terms of their new programs that are confirmed for 2015, $125 million impact, didn't know if you could characterize that as half-year contribution or 9-month contribution, what the full annualized benefit of those new programs would be? Secondly, the unconfirmed programs, given your capacity ramp, could that be material for 2015 if you do get more unconfirmed programs?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Glenn Chamandy (Executives)】\nWell, I would say that typically both 70% of the programs we get in here, so I would say that of the $120 million, that would represent annualizing their 70% of the total annualized opportunity. And as far as the unconfirmed, look, we don't want to speculate on things we don't have today. That's why we don't put it in our guidance, but we have the capacity to support, obviously, and the inventory to support additional programs, both in branded as well if our Printwear POS exceeds our expectations, we have room to advance our sales opportunity through these 2 avenues. So we're going to be very aggressive to pursue new programs. We're committed to driving the strategy. All of the stars are aligned are in place, and we're making the right investments, not just in our manufacturing, but we're investing in our brand strategies and we think that the capacity is in place, and hopefully, we'll achieve and exceed the sales guidance.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Burns (Analysts)】\nAnd then just a quick question in terms of Printwear market share, I'm not sure if you're willing to provide current, but either way, in terms of with the price changes, is there a potential for material market share gains from current levels? In your order of your priorities when making this decision, how important was market share gains in that decision?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Glenn Chamandy (Executives)】\nWe look at the overall market, and one of the things that we're going to do is by having our price strategy the way we structure it today, one of the things that we're going to benefit from is allowing our distributors to reach out to markets that they weren't able to reach out to before, and that's a fundamental change I would say a little bit, because they're going to be more competitively priced with our products, and there are other factors and other competitors outside of our distributor channel today that we've always measured. So now our customers are going to have a product and a price from Gildan really to reach out to new customers they weren't able to reach out to before. So indirectly, that should increase our share with our existing customers; provide them with better earnings power and better sales, so it becomes a win-win. It's win for them and win for us.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Petrie (Analysts)】\nJust a few follow-ups. I wonder if you could just talk a bit about the manufacturing efficiencies. The $100 million and what you expect to achieve in '15. And then how much is still to come in '16? I understand the yarn-spinning isn't until '16, but if you could just put some dollar numbers on it, that will be great.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Glenn Chamandy (Executives)】\nWe're going to have about $25 million of the $100 million are going through in that '15, and then of the balance, a large portion of that will flow through in '16, and then the balance of that will go through into '17. The majority of the savings we have so far are from the energy projects and other things that we've invested in, and the big yarn-spinning initiative will really impact us in '16 and the balance in '17.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Petrie (Analysts)】\nSo the yarn-spinning is really sort of a flip of the switch at the end of '15.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Glenn Chamandy (Executives)】\nRight now, we've -- what's happened in yarn-spinning is that we've ramped up 100% our Salisbury 1 ring-spun plant. We modernized our 2 other facilities which is Clarkton and Cedartown. That's what we did this year, but the major new capital investments that are really going to drive the savings for us is our Salisbury 2 plant, which is the largest yarn facility, probably in the world. It's being ramped up as we speak and will be fully ramped up over the next, probably, 6 to 7, 8 months. And then our Mocksville plant, which is going to be probably one of the largest ring-spun plants, is going to be started in our calendar first quarter, and basically be ramped up through '15. So both these initiatives are going to make a major impact on our cost structure, and as well as allow us to continue to add value in our garments and drive our sales in ring-spun yarns, for example, as we go forward into the future.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Petrie (Analysts)】\nSorry, and which one is ring-spun? Are they both ring-spun? Or is one open-end, one is ring-spun.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Glenn Chamandy (Executives)】\nYes, well Salisbury 2 is -- Salisbury 1 is ring-spun. Salisbury 2 is an open-end facility, and our Mocksville facility is going to be the largest ring-spun facility in this hemisphere.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chase Bethel (Analysts)】\nOn the CapEx side, Glenn, can you, just maybe in broad terms, talk to us about just the discipline you have given you're in the middle of a multi-year CapEx program that's the biggest in the company's history to see the dollars invested well? And then also, I think, so you mentioned the $250 million to $300 million being mostly the balance on the textile facilities, but then Laurence, in your comment, you talked about possibly new energy savings programs. So how much is there may be a lot for energy savings programs that you may not have really spoken to yet?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Glenn Chamandy (Executives)】\nThe large part of our capital is in yarn-spinning as well as -- I mean the big projects that we mentioned are the yarn-spinning projects. We're expanding our 2 major new initiatives in textiles, which is Rio Nance 6 in Costa Rica. We're expanding our distribution centers in the United States and in Eden. At the same time, we're investing in energy, and with that energy position, it's completing the programs that we have put together in terms of our biomass and also part of our electrical saving program that we put together, but the bulk of the savings, the bulk of the investment is going to be in yarn-spinning and textiles. I'd say it would be the bulk of the capital that we're going to be investing in from this point on.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chase Bethel (Analysts)】\nOkay, great. And then on the Branded Apparel side, I was hoping that you could maybe help me with what would be the private label mix exiting calendar '15? And then you mentioned the $10 million to $15 million of marketing spend. If I put roughly a 12% SG&A rate on the $2.65 billion, it looks more like $35 million incremental SG&A. So maybe Laurence, can you talk to where the balance is going?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Glenn Chamandy (Executives)】\nSG&A, he wants to know balance of the SG&A.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Sellyn (Executives)】\nSorry, I must have not understand the question.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chase Bethel (Analysts)】\nIf you're going to have a similar rate of say, 12% SG&A rate, and your guidance is $2.65 billion. The difference that I'm coming to is around $35 million year-over-year, and there's $10 million to $15 million earmarked for marketing.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Sellyn (Executives)】\nThere's the Doris acquisition and we paid low bonuses issue, there was lower incentive compensation this year that would be more normal next year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chase Bethel (Analysts)】\nOkay, and private label mix exiting 2015 in terms of the portion of Branded Apparel.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Glenn Chamandy (Executives)】\nYes. Look, as far as the private label is down 15%, probably will be our rate. Look at our focus is to divest ourselves at private label, and part of that also is we have stopped selling one of our licenses, we gave up a license that we had in one of -- and in socks under the new balance license, but our whole focus is obviously to continue driving our brand strategy, and we basically are pushing to sell Gildan and Gold Toe products, so we've given up some private label.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chase Bethel (Analysts)】\nOkay, if I can sneak one more in. Laurence, you used to give a sensitivity of a 1% change in Printwear pricing. Do you have a number like that today?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Sellyn (Executives)】\nWell it's 1% of the Printwear sales.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Glenn Chamandy (Executives)】\nAre you talking about pricing, or are you talking about cotton. What are you talking about? Pricing?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chase Bethel (Analysts)】\n1% change in Printwear price, the EPS impact of that. I think the last time it was around $0.11 or so...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Sellyn (Executives)】\nYes. So today we're more like $0.15 today.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jarrod Feinstein (Analysts)】\nThis is Jarrod Feinstein on for David Glick. Can you help us bridge the gap between the consensus EPS of $0.42 for Q1 and the $0.30 loss that you're looking for? And maybe the inventory devaluations is like $45 million, I believe. So if you could break out the balance of the difference, how much is marketing, how much is price reduction, manufacturing efficiencies et cetera?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Sellyn (Executives)】\nOkay, well, the deval, as you mentioned, is $45 million. We also mentioned the Printwear destocking, which is about $0.10. The impact of higher cost cotton and the consumption of inventories with the transitional manufacturing inefficiencies between the two of them that would be another $0.10. SG&A, including the brand advertising and marketing to support holiday sales would be, maybe $0.03 or $0.04. And then on the positive side, we have growth in Branded Apparel sales volumes and the accretive impact of Doris. So these are the positives that will drive the Branded Apparel growth in earnings in the December quarter.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jim Duffy (Analysts)】\nA couple of questions. Glenn, if cotton cost go higher, could the Printwear market accept the price increase?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Glenn Chamandy (Executives)】\nWell look, I mean, we didn't -- our pricing actions are really not a function of cotton and that's a byproduct of it. I mean right now, we're focusing on changing our discount structure to our customers and driving our low-cost manufacturing. I mean, obviously, cotton is a big component of our cost of goods sold. And if it was going to be materially going up, I mean there would definitely prices would follow in the future, but really, that's not the driving force behind what's made our decision to be more aggressive on price?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jim Duffy (Analysts)】\nOkay, and then Glenn, what's the probability that new CFO comes in, has a different view of margin structure and feels the need to take a more conservative view on the outlook?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Glenn Chamandy (Executives)】\nWell, I mean the margin structure of our company is still very successful. I mean I think that even despite our pricing actions, we're getting returns probably in one of the best returns in the whole apparel segment as a company if you look at our forecast for calendar '15. So I think he's going to be pretty happy working for a company that is growing its top line sales at the rate we are, is investing heavily in manufacturing and investing in their brand strategy and still making these huge returns, generating huge amounts of cash flow, great place to come to work. We're on the -- once we're on the winning team come work to Gildan, that's the way I would look at it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jim Duffy (Analysts)】\nWell, that make sense. But this -- I guess, so I interpret this, this is Laurence's guidance, is it also your guidance, and you're going to stand behind this?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Glenn Chamandy (Executives)】\nThis is my guidance and I am the one who...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Sellyn (Executives)】\nI work for him.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Glenn Chamandy (Executives)】\nHe works for me and I'm fully responsible for making the strategies, same as strategies in the company, same as strategy in our pricing, working with our branded group and our advertising, making our capital investments. There's probably not a CEO in our industry as is involved in the day-to-day operations as I am. So I stand 150% behind our guidance. I'm committed to delivering the guidance to the market, not myself. The metric was down to every one of the Gildan employees. It's a team effort here at Gildan, and everybody wants to be on the winning team, so we're excited about the future, and one thing for sure is that we're never scared to make the decisions to drive the long-term shareholder value. I am a shareholder of the company. I still have a significant stake in stock in this company, and I'm committed to making sure that we succeed in the future and that all the employees of Gildan are successful and happy working in our organization.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chris Li (Analysts)】\nSorry, if you said this already, what is your 3% sales target for Printwear implied in terms of unit volume growth for calendar '15?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Glenn Chamandy (Executives)】\nWell, I don't want to give that, but I can tell you, look, we said we had about $0.70 decline in pricing, and our unit growth is 3, so you can sort of do the math.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chris Li (Analysts)】\nOkay, okay that's fine. And my second question is you mentioned you're going to see about $0.35 of EPS benefit from lower cotton cost in calendar '15, but it's only partial because you're still cycling through some hard cost inventory. If you assume cotton sort of stays where it is right now, what will be the incremental EPS benefit in calendar '16? Should we think like it's going to be higher than $0.35?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Glenn Chamandy (Executives)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chris Li (Analysts)】\nOkay, that's fine for now.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Sellyn (Executives)】\nAnd just to go back to the first part of your question, we mentioned in the call that our projected impact of higher volume between the 2 divisions on our guidance for calendar -- our earnings, projected earnings growth in calendar 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 is $0.60 a share. So we're looking for good growth in Printwear as well as in, of course, Branded Apparel.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Brian Morrison (Analysts)】\nI have just a few follow-up questions. Just on that cotton question with respect to '16, is it fair to say that $0.35 benefit that you get in the back half of '15, you should get another $0.35 benefit in '16 assuming cotton prices stay constant?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Sellyn (Executives)】\nYes, that's math.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Glenn Chamandy (Executives)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Brian Morrison (Analysts)】\nOkay. That's fine. And then in terms of last year when we were down 100 as we talked about global lifestyle of major customers and potential for $400 million to $500 million incremental revenue over the next 3 to 5 years, and I wondered if we're progressing as planned on that front.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Glenn Chamandy (Executives)】\nYes we are, we're growing that business, it's projected to be up about 25% next year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Brian Morrison (Analysts)】\nFair enough. And then, Glenn, just last question in terms of acquisitions. You've said for a few quarters now it's a strategic priority. You've increased your credit facilities you have for the NCIB and potential acquisitions. Is it fair to say that an acquisition, it's a necessity rather than an option just to enhance your brand position just based on your relevant size?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Glenn Chamandy (Executives)】\nNo. I would not say that. I think that where we are today, we can grow significantly in every single one of the categories. I mean, we've made a huge investment over the last couple of years in building our brands and our distribution, our relationship with our customers. So there's a lot of opportunity for us for organic growth. I mean you can see this year we have a lot of organic growth in the tune of over 20 something percent 23%, 24% of just organic growth, but still the possibility is to obtain new programs that which haven't solidified yet. So our organic opportunity, and that is continuing to accelerate because as we get more placement and our stronger brand presence, we're going to continue to grow organically, because the market is so large in branded, there's a huge opportunity in house. Saying that, we did an acquisition with Doris. Although the acquisition is relatively small, it's opening up huge doors for us. It's giving us doors in the U.S. where we're going to place shear, and it's not just going in and, let's say, for example, saying I got shear, it's actually signed a full product category to our customers, which allows them to have more confidence in growing the other things that we really want to grow like our underwear and our socks and our activewear products. So the acquisitions don't have to be large in size. They have to be strategic in nature, and I think that's the key. So it's got to be something that will give us a product category, a brand strategy, a channel of distribution, a new market. I mean we're always going to be very tactical about how we approach acquisitions. We don't want to do acquisitions just for the sake of looking for top line growth, because we think we can do that with better returns by driving organic sales, and we can't just by buying companies for top line sales so everything is strategic. And I think so far if you look at every one in the acquisitions, we've done over the last 5, 6 years basically, that is sort of our MO. So we're continuing to look. We obviously have some things that we continue to look at, but nothing is embedded in our guidance today, and we're excited about our balance sheet and the ability for us to continue to look at these opportunities.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Stephen MacLeod (Analysts)】\nMy questions have all been answered.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Sophie Argiriou (Executives)】\nThank you, everyone, once again for joining us. This concludes our call today, and of course, we look forward to speaking to you very soon and we'd also like to wish you the very best for the holiday season. Have a great day.",

      "transcript_text1": "Right, let's get started. All the forward-looking stuff, okay? We'll get right to business. A year ago, I -- we stood here, and we talked about kind of an outline for the year. It was going to be an active year, and I think we've done what we set out to do: aggressive portfolio reshaping underway; good industrial execution, including a ton of restructuring. So over the last few years, we've done more than $4 billion of restructuring to improve the cost base of the company. Simpler structure, smaller GE Capital and focus on returns. So I think as I go through this pivot in 2015 and '16, what you're going to see is the world's best infrastructure company where every business in the company leverages the core competency and very tightly, the core capability of the company; $40 billion returned to investors over the next few years in dividends and the Synchrony split, so kind of what we outlined last year is underway; substantial EPS tailwind with restructuring Alstom, buyback, not having restructuring exceed gains, industrial execution. Smaller GE Capital, we continue to make it smaller and cultural simplification and accountability, and I'll talk about all those things today. And the output of that is going to be a good, solid, double-digit EPS growth for the next few years. An output of it is earnings, industrial earnings exceeding 75% of our total earnings and expanding margins and returns. So I'm going to talk about all these things -- all of these things as we go through today.\r\nWatchers of CNBC, you know there's a lot going on in the world, so that's kind of the mode we're in today. Some of them are better. I'd say the U.S. economy still feels like it's getting better. Air travel, rail travel, quite strong even today. U.S. healthcare around the edges, getting a little bit better. Some thing's the same. Most of the growth markets are the same. Natural gas prices, power demand remains the same, and certain things clearly under stress, so oil prices down, Russia tough, FX, things like that. So it's just a slow growth, full of volatility. It's kind of what we've seen since the financial crisis. Things get magnified in the short term, and that's kind of the world that we live in. But we still think there's plenty of growth out there to be had and as you pick through and go through the world.\r\nNow oil price decline, I'm going to talk a little bit more about the Oil & Gas business in a little while, but we've been through cycles before. So we prepare all our businesses to go through a cycle, so Lorenzo and his team are working on cost out. Even before the oil prices went down, the Oil & Gas customers were really focused on improving the quality of the projects. We've been working on product standardization, things like that, for a long time. That's all going to get accelerated. And we're going to be able to pick through customers and projects that we want. I think if you're a big oil company in a time like this, GE looks better as a supplier during a time like this, so we like our competitive position. And we're going to look for opportunities, vis-à-vis share, people that we can hire, things like that.\r\nAnd the rest of it kind of looks like fine. There's puts and takes, but the rest of the company looks fine. And I always find sometimes we're in the middle of one of these big macro kind of distractions and things like that. It's good to think about micro a little bit. So I've been going to China for 25 years, China's okay. The micro of China for -- in the Aviation business, the Healthcare business, a lot of -- the power business, China's fine. If you're in the commercial real estate business in China, not so good. We're not there in commercial real estate, so China's is okay.\r\nIn the resources places, if you're a low-cost producer like Saudi, you're still going forward. If you're a marginal producer like Iraq, Venezuela, it's going to be tough. It's going to be tough. I always have to remind people, the country that where still is GE most hedged to is the United States because the United States does better. Because of low gas prices, that is great for us. If low gas prices are felt broadly in Europe and U.S. and China, that's going to be good for GE.\r\nAviation and Transportation, the commercial spares rate, average daily order rate today is higher than any time I can ever remember. We will set record orders this year in locomotives. So when you think about the micro, it's just a little bit of a different perspective.\r\nAnd then in the power market, we're working on some of our biggest power deals that we've ever had that are -- some of which will be announced yet this year on power projects. So people need electricity. They're going to still invest in power projects.\r\nSo the micro is still okay. There's going to be pockets -- clearly, with oil prices down, there's going to be pockets of that get filled in. But I think looking at the micro sometimes is helpful as you go through things like this.\r\nOur framework on the year, we're still on track for the Industrial double-digit segment growth for the year and margin expansion, organic growth and margin expansion. My sense, we said revenues in the quarter would be above the high end of the range. That still looks like what we're tracking to. And revenue for the year will be close to the high end of the range, organic growth. That's what's still what we're tracking to in 2014.\r\nCapital's tracking more to a $6.9 billion number than a $6.7 billion number. We're going to do more restructuring and charges in the quarter, a couple of pennies more. Again, we've done a ton of restructuring this year, guys, without gains. So going forward, we're going to go back to gains offsetting restructuring, but this year, to get ready for the Synchrony spin, get our industrial costs down, we've been very aggressive with restructuring this year.\r\nCFOA is tracking towards the middle of that range on CFOA. And revenues, I already went through in terms of how we're tracking for organic growth for the year. So that's kind of the framework as we look at it this year.\r\nAnd now I'm going to switch to kind of a strategic update, and then, at the end, I'll go through segment by segment and give you how we're looking at 2015. So look, we're tracking to have the world's best infrastructure company. By '16, more than 75% of our earnings are going to be an output of that, and a smaller GE Capital. Every business in the industrial sector can leverage all of our capabilities, what we call the GE Store: technology, services, global footprint; simple structure. Every business is going to be able to fully leverage that and take advantage of it. A good, solid industrial EPS growth through the period and a smaller Financial Services and one that's based really on competitive advantage and returns when we think about the total portfolio.\r\nWe've done a lot of work over the last 10 years on the portfolio. I would say a couple of things industrially. We're just more diversified industrially within each business, and we've exited all the industrial businesses that didn't fit the infrastructure model. So we've exited Appliances, plastics, silicones, business like that.\r\nWhen I stood here, let's say, in 2002, more than 50% of our earnings came from 1 product and 1 market. F turbines in the United States was 50% of the company's industrial earnings. So we have very actively, within Healthcare, within power, within Aviation broadened our capability. And so I like standing here today with the set of infrastructure businesses that all utilize our core advantage and have more capability in their industries, more profit pools inside their industries, and that's what we have here today. \r\nThen on the Financial Services side, smaller. Look, we exited insurance in time. I think we got too big in consumer finance, and we had to go backwards on that but really, focus on a smaller Financial Service business, doing things within our control. And I think Synchrony is going to turn out to be a good trade for investors as we go through this.\r\nSo focus on staying close to domain, doing deals of the right size, really generating strong returns in the synergies. These are the things as I look forward in the company going forward. And I think where we stand here today, just less portfolio activity and very tight focus on returns, very tight focus on returns as we stand here today thinking about the portfolio and where we stand.\r\nWe did 3 big deals in 2014: Alstom, which I'll talk a little bit more about, in a sector we know very well, complementary, financially attractive, generating synergies, high-double digit returns, high-teens returns. \r\nSynchrony, that we've done, the first part of Synchrony. We've asked for you to model Synchrony as if we'll have it for the full year in 2015, but we're going to look to execute on the remainder of Synchrony as soon as we can in the year, but that's just for modeling purposes, the way I think about it. Look, based on current pricing and things like that, this is going to be attractive, maybe as much as 700 million shares, plus or minus, that we're going to be able to exchange and a big gain in Synchrony. \r\nAnd then Appliances, we think we did a fair trade, another gain in the Appliance business, attractive buyer. So these are 3 big deals that we did this year that we think executed on the strategy in an important way.\r\nSo with Synchrony, what does capital look like? I'd say, by the end of 2015 x Synchrony, we'll be below $300 billion of ENI. We'll continue to exit Australia, central and European banks, things like that. We're focused on the verticals or places where we have a competitive advantage. We're going to be building regulatory capability and look to enter the CCAR process in 2017 and focus on improving returns.\r\nAnd then I always hate to give kind of single-point guidance, but I find with GE Capital, it's helpful for investors just to know how we're thinking about it. I would think about $0.60 a share in 2015, and with Synchrony out and fewer gains and things like that, about $0.40 a share in '16. We're still thinking about ways in an investor-friendly way to continue to reduce the size of GE Capital, driving a consistent dividend and improving returns in terms of the business and where it is.\r\nIn terms of Alstom, we're in the midst of the integration process. There's -- we've got more than 300 people working on this full time. There's things we know and can talk about. There's things we -- they're still a public company, so I'm limited in terms of how much I can really say. But the synergy pipeline's robust. They've got good people. They've got good factories. They've got good people. Its products and technologies we know. It dramatically expands the global operations of the company in an important way. What is -- as expected, the technology is kind of what we knew it was; where it fits. In some places, it's much better than what we have, particularly in areas of grid, but very complementary.\r\nThe people, we've known. When we did the EGT acquisition in the late '90s, these were all Alstom folks, so we know them quite well.  The government processes and compliance monitors are on track within our deal case, so that's important. We've hired some ex-Bechtel people to go through the EPC process with us to learn a lot about the project, so we're going through that. So far, it looks like a pretty good capability. And the first half cash was lower than they expected and due to tough markets, but it's going to improve in the second half, and we already see a pathway on that.\r\nSo that's kind of the update. We're -- for the planning purposes, we're counting on a mid-2015 close. Let's say, midyear, so that seems to be a pretty decent assumption vis-à-vis where we are today.\r\nThis goes back to last April when we laid out the synergy plan. We talked about $400 million of synergies and supply chain and services, and that looks pretty good. There's a 10-point margin delta between our service business and their service business, so that looks like a pretty good place to hunt. 1,000 combined sites, 1/3 of which are in the same city; that looks like a decent place to hunt. And like I said, the manufacturing processes are quite good. We're quite impressed with their manufacturing team, and we like what they're doing.\r\nThere's a ton of juice in sourcing. There's like $1 billion -- more than $1 billion that either 1 of us buy that the other company makes, right. So if you slap on a 20% margin on that, you wake up in the morning with just $200 million just by replacing suppliers, and that looks pretty good, $12 billion combined buy. Technology, very complementary skills.\r\nIf you look at our SG&A benchmarks versus theirs, there appears to be a decent amount of synergies. So the synergies look pretty good. And then we didn't really count on any growth synergies, but when you look at the global footprint, when you look at the aspects of where they are and some of the things we think we can do with the installed base, there seems to be some reason to think that there might be some growth synergies.\r\nSo we've kind of laid out for you, this was -- this is going to be $0.01 accretive in 2015 all in. In '16, it's $0.06 to $0.09 accretive and then ought to grow from there. So high-teens return and improved strategic position, we like the way Alstom is lining out so far. A ton of potential, just a ton of potential, but it's going to take our best effort, and we're going to have to dedicate a lot of people, a lot of management time to it to be successful in this field.\r\nAnd then you look at just what the combined entity looks like. From an infrastructure standpoint, this is a fine company. This is a fine set of businesses. We ought to have a couple of years of -- with the Alstom synergies and the buyback and just organic -- reasonable organic growth and gains and restructuring offsetting. You're going to get a couple of strong years as far as we can see with -- in the environment we see today of good earnings growth. You've got a strong set of #1 franchises that are in this business, all of which can leverage the GE core. It makes the company's core capabilities even stronger, so it makes us a better technology company. It strengthens our hand in growth markets. It gives us probably more than a $200 billion service backlog. We think there's opportunity for incremental returns here. Just getting the Alstom synergies is quite strong, but it also is going to play into the work we're doing on ROIC and gross margins and more scale on a simpler foundation. And we're going to be in the middle of global infrastructure, energy transitions, growth markets, efficiency, environmental investing, a whole series of things. So you're going to have a great-looking industrial company going forward really built on our GE capability.\r\nAnd the GE capability looks something like this. We talk about this a lot of different ways a lot of different times, but in some way, shape or form, we've talked about the same 4 initiatives for the last decade or so. This is a great technology company that spreads ideas throughout the company with a global research center, a legitimate global research center that spreads ideas. This is a fantastic global company that's got a global growth organization led by a Vice Chairman who sits in Hong Kong, where we have a very strong franchise in all these countries around the world. It's fantastic with services and customers, with a software COE, a service counsel and some of the best service operations in the world. And it's a -- this Lean culture heading towards 12% SG&A as a percentage of revenue with cultural development, training and development and things like that. And every one of our industrial businesses now can trade fully on this capability.\r\nAt the same time, every one of the businesses adds to this capability. So in the case of aircraft engines, aircraft engines is a first mover on engineering productivity material science. Aviation is the business that delivered CMCs, which power business now uses, and additive manufacturing that the Healthcare business now uses.\r\nHealthcare is the anchor tenant in every growth market around the world. We had 2,000 employees in Healthcare in the year 1999. All of the original staffing for the power business, the Aviation business came from Healthcare. Most of the diagnostics technology we use across the service installed base comes from Healthcare.\r\nTransportation business brings combustion science, engine technology, localization, again, a first mover in lot of the countries around the world.\r\nThe power business really brings the services installed base and the services capability. The power business has 17 facilities that every business, Transportation, Oil & Gas, uses. Oil & Gas has been the first mover in Africa and lots of other hard places to get to, brings a ton in service technology, great applications and controls. Energy Management, all of the power conversion, electrification controls technology comes from Energy Management back into the GE Store. So I think as you think about this, what makes GE work? It's this very strong core competency and a very great capability built around these core aspects in terms of who we are and what we do, and that's the GE Store.\r\nNow we're going to make the GE Store better. So a lot about what we've been executing on in the past and a lot about what we're going to be doing in the future is built really on this page. And then I'm going to amplify it in the future -- in the next couple of pages.\r\nTechnology today isn't just about delivering new features. You also have to deliver it at a fundamentally lower cost point. We're doing technologies and manufacturing at the same time. When we invest in R&D, we're investing as much in manufacturing as we have any time in our history, absolutely key, absolutely key. We are going to be a huge player in globalization and in growth markets. We're going to have the world's biggest franchise with a ton of localization capability.\r\nThree, we really do believe that every industrial company, everybody in your universe is going to have to be basic and analytics and information technology. We fundamentally believe that. And we're putting our money where our mouth is, and we're going to continue to do that, and we think we're going to win doing that.\r\nFour, based on all of those things, I think we have underwritten the healthiest service franchise in the world. Your highest margin as an investor, your most valuable asset is the installed base, we've made that even more valuable, and I'll show you the ways we're going to do that in the future.\r\nFive, we're going to take simplification that we've talked about on our structural cost, and we are in the midst of driving that massively into gross margins and ROIC. So we've got a lot of juice there, and we're going to continue to be -- use that to be able to drive our margins.\r\nAnd six, just the strong culture of simplification and accountability are critical in terms of how we look at the future driving FastWorks and the other parts of the company. So this is really executing our strategy.\r\nWe've got great products. Our products differentially are the best that I can remember. On a differential basis, we've got a great position. H turbine, highest efficient, largest gas turbine in the world. It's a bigger part of the segment. We've got 37 technical wins. We are going to really do a great job with the H turbine.\r\nTier 4 locomotive, we're nearly the only one approved to get a lot of orders, and that's how I started my career, with selling Lexan. We were the only polycarbonate company in the world. We thought we were geniuses as salespeople. When you have the only one, it's a good thing, right.\r\nLEAP engine, our win rate is huge right now on the LEAP. We're doing quite well in terms of how we're positioned. This is going to be a huge launch on the LEAP engine.\r\nPET/MR, I was at the RSNA, and we had the best alignment of new products I can remember in a long time. We were behind Siemens on the PET/MR. It's much better. Our MR product line, CT product line, ultrasound, we just we look really good in the healthcare sector right now.\r\nLots of Oil & Gas innovation. 20k BOP is going to get launched. It's highly efficient and highly effective. And Power Conversion is a very important horizontal capability in terms of the company and is going to see some good growth for GE going forward. So we really have a great array of products right at the right time, ready to launch.\r\nBut we're also making them in a different way. When we increased our R&D as a percentage of revenue from 4% to 5%, that extra piece, a lot of it went into manufacturing technology. And that's going to pay off for our investors as we do that in a number of important ways.\r\nMaterials and additives, you've heard us talk about -- you've heard Dave Joyce talk about CMCs but also this strong manufacturing capability that we bring across the product line.\r\nDesign and test, this is unsexy as hell, but we have a test stand in Greenville that can do full-load gas turbine testing. It is awesome. You can now take the product. We can iterate the product. We can bring customers to see the product. People will insure the product. Insurance companies will insure the product. Testing is a massive advantage and something that we have a leadership position in.\r\nI would say the choice to do vertical integration, with the way we design our products now, we basically own all the designs. We can choose how much we want to chew off on vertical integration, but we're going to get more margin. We're either going to get it through lower sourcing pricing or by doing more ourselves. \r\nAnd just digitalization, we're taking all of the things we talked about in Minds & Machines, and we're applying that back into our own factories.\r\nSo if you if you look at the LEAP, the LEAP has got a lower starting point and a faster learning curve than the GEnx. It's been designed more efficiently than the GEnx and is going to have a lower fundamental cost. And as you guys know, as Dave would tell you with the LEAP, 1 or 2 points either way is worth hundreds of millions of dollars over the lifetime of the product.\r\nAnd the H turbine is going to start with a lower initial cost and with a faster learning curve, more productivity than any of the products we've ever introduced. So we really have aligned cost and technology very well in this process.\r\nWe're going to be a $60 billion -- GE plus Alstom is $60 billion in growth markets. We're just profoundly well positioned in just about every country that counts around the world. It's going to give us scale. It's going to give us competitive advantage. It's going to improve our scope. But when you look at a place like China, we'll have probably close to 30 factories, real critical mass across the entire company.\r\nIndia, that's a place where Alstom was superior to GE, has a very strong leadership team, more factories and better position in India. Middle East, North Africa and Turkey, I talk about that, Alstom really adds to the capability and mass of the company going forward. So we now as a company are not only bigger than our competition but can really utilize and play any game strategically on a global basis, big competitive advantage.\r\nWe also have the software that goes with it. I think in the world we live in today, you just can't miss anything, right. So you're going to have to be present and get the incremental businesses that exist around the world, and you've got to do that in a cost-effective and efficient way at the same time.\r\nSo on localization, we are around the big deals as they take place. China's going to be a very active market next year in the aviation sector, lots of campaigns that we're going to have to be focused on. Most of them, they're robotic campaigns.\r\nLike I said, emergency power, you're going to see deals yet this year that are in the emergency power space, people that need electricity. You've got to be well positioned. No 2 of these deals are the same, but when you look at a deal like Algeria, these are very important for the company strategically. We'll do about 1,000 locomotives around the world between '15 and '18. We're well positioned in a lot of places globally there.\r\nWe can compete any place in the world from a value healthcare standpoint, so can go against Mindray or others at high margins in the markets around the world. And even with oil, where it is, there's going to be some big projects in Africa next year on Subsea and Oil & Gas that GE is going to participate in and look at and work hard on. So localization helps drive growth. But by being local in these markets, we also have more presence that can improve our productivity and cost at the same time.\r\nNow one of the things that John Rice has done as we've gone globally is really invested in these multi-modality sites. So as we invest globally, no site now is one GE business. It's multiple GE businesses. I show you here just Haiphong and Pune in India, but that's about $500 million of output, 20% savings, and we're doing this more and more on a global basis.\r\nEngineering centers, one of the metrics that we look is operating cost per hour. So when you look at Mexico and Poland from an engineering standpoint, they have an operating cost per hour of 20% or 30% below the rest of the world. And shared services, we're doing in 5 centers now on a global basis. So globalization is giving us both a cost base and a revenue base that, again, I think, makes us very competitive in the world we live in today.\r\nThis comes from Minds & Machines. We basically discussed the investments we're making in analytics, about $300 million to $400 million a year, and this is going to add to a higher service growth rate, more dollars per installed base and higher service margins, better product feedback. It also connects us more closely to our customers. And this is still ongoing. This is still -- we're still making a ton of progress along these lines.\r\nAnd we also talked about our own investment in information technology. That helps us get our 1% and helps us be more efficient with our installed base in manufacturing. And so these are things that we're going to talk about at every meeting, give you updates on and let you know how we're doing and what our capability is.\r\nOne of the important horizontal capabilities that we're investing in around the company is in controls. Controls is a critical horizontal capability for the industrial Internet. We now can take controls and back fit them in to B- and E-class turbines, the old installed base. When you do that, you open up their ability to accept the industrial Internet or accept software and analytics on top of that. We think this is going to give us a chance to drive better upgrades around the installed base.\r\nLife optimizing controls, we're doing around all the wind turbines. This allows us to improve their uptime. This gives us ways to substantially grow the service franchise for our wind business by double digits even in a sluggish or tougher market. So controls, new technology, new ways to think about the future.\r\nIn the case of locomotives, look, our rail customers are going to allow us to be their operating ERP. This shows a real live example of a locomotive customer. We have 8 different software offerings that we're selling to this customer. It's -- the potential for each 1 of the locomotive customers is about $100 million of incremental revenue each year, dramatically increasing the dollars per installed base. The ones that don't have numbers associated with them, we're doing today, and the 1, 2, 3 are new offerings, new bids that we're driving. So this is real-time accelerating growth in our service business.\r\nAnd in the case of information technology, we're aggressively driving ERP reduction, application reduction, more knowledge inside the company. And I'll just show you 2 businesses here, our Water business and our Life Science business. And as we've been able to collapse the structure of these businesses that were largely built through acquisitions, we've grown our operating profit substantially over that time period. Both of these franchises have return on capital of 15% or more. And so we're able to use the simplification of the structure and the information technology to drive better margins, lower SG&A, better returns on all these businesses going forward.\r\nSo better products, better global footprint, the intersection of physical and digital, and that investment in physical and digital leads us to really underwriting an incredibly important and valuable piece of turf for our investors, which is our installed base. We see steady growth. We're going to have another good year in '14 in services of organic growth, margins and backlog. We expect another strong year in '15. We're growing our dollars per installed base by 3%, which is very healthy. That's a good level for us. Our margins are up substantially in services this year. Our incremental software sales are strong. Our Predictivity orders will exceed $1.5 billion, and we're now looking back at this aged fleet where our penetration is lower, whether it's jet engines or locomotives or gas turbines and licking our chops about where that could go in the future. Alstom adds 35% to our installed base and there's a 10-point service differential in terms of margins there. So we see some good opportunities in our -- in -- with the acquisition.\r\nGE brings a ton in technology. We bring a lot in terms of global footprint and Alstom actually has quite a good service business as well, particularly around the multi-vendor service and aged fleet. So we think there's a ton of complementary synergies in terms of where we stand here.\r\nSo number four is this big focus on services' profit -- long-term profit, huge backlog. Alstom's right in the sweet spot here. And this is a place where our performance is actually getting better each day, and we like where we are.\r\nI thought I'd just take you through one business as an example, an important business, which is Power Gen Services, just to allow you to see whereas you used to have how big your installed base grew was the only determinant of whether you made more money in services year after year, you now have 5 or 6 engines that are growing simultaneously in terms of the power business. So you've always got new products. And our close rate, whether it's in aircraft engines or locomotives or Healthcare, our close rate around new technology with CSA is always huge. So you only start close to 100% on CSA close rate.\r\nThen you add to that upgrades. You hear us talking about Advanced Gas Paths, which will be about 80, and there'll be even more next year. But on top of that, we also do upgrades to a lot of our other old fleets in terms of where we go with a ton of margin dollars associated with that.\r\nWe'll have $300 million of just software sales in the business. That's probably twice what it was in 2014. And we're going after the B and E class of fleets, so we're going after the old aged fleet with new controls and analytics. We've got a great global footprint, so our close rate globally is as high. Our close rate is as high in Australia, China, places like that, than it is in the United States, and we're generating $350 million, $400 million of productivity every year. So you march through there, and we're just changing the game around our service businesses. And I could tell the same story in Aviation or Healthcare, other businesses, so really critical.\r\nSo products, global, physical and digital, that leads to better service and service outcome and then a real focus on just intensifying kind of wing-to-wing process improvement. We've done a good job on SG&A, getting down to 12% of SG&A. I view that as the right place to start because it's not only cost that we could take out but also made running the place easier. So that's key. We've always worked on the other buckets, but we're just doing this with more focus and intensity, so setting real gross margin targets, contribution margin, less R&D. And as you do SG&A and as you do gross margins, 80% of -- more or less 80% of our ROIC or our returns improvements are driven by margin growth. Then, we add to that a focus on better capital intensity, a better capital usage down there, free cash flow conversion.\r\nSo we're basically saying, look, we're on a pathway to get to 12% by 2016 in terms of SG&A. We started in '13 at 27% segment gross margins. We want to get 50 basis points annually on gross margins. And we told you last year we wanted to get to 17% ROIC, and we're on a path to do that. So the new metric today, let's say, is around gross margins and improvement we want to see there.\r\nTo do that, you got to focus on what we call the axes. You got to focus on the critical projects, the critical areas. They're going to really move the needle and make those a horizontal capability inside the company. So for us, there's really 8 of them. It's product cost, which goes without saying, when you're in a high-tech infrastructure business, product cost, that's just about everything we do. Operating cost per hour, so that's a blended average of how we engineer, where we make things and we put everything on a common basis. Value gap, which is really a comparison of how you sell versus how you buy, so critical in terms of to see if you're recovering inflation. Engineering efficiency in big businesses like Aviation, this is really key, and there's ways that we can measure engineering output. Service productivity is something we share with you all the time.  Reliability in a business like Transportation, any businesses that have big CSA portfolios, reliability is a critical determinant of how you ultimately drive margin into your installed base. P&E efficiency goes without saying, and working capital turns is a common one.\r\nAnd so converge on metrics, horizontal process, Dan Heintzelman and Jeff Bornstein and the corporate audit staff focused on that. Compensation linked to metrics -- linked to outcome metrics and making sure that the -- that all the projects give us room for mix because that is the hardest thing to predict. And I would say that's the place where we'd whiffed in the past, and so we just have to set the bar higher that can accommodate different mix formulas inside the company.\r\nAnd then I show you in the end how does it work in a real-time example, and again, to pick on David, but he's doing a good job. You all think that, I think, so -- as I sure do. So Aviation has 25% gross margins, 7% SG&A, 18% returns, 90% cash conversion. So if you look at a business like Aviation, the things that stand out are gross margins, not SG&A, and he's been in a heavy CapEx cycle launching all these engines. We got -- just have to drive more efficiency in the CapEx cycle. So in the Aviation business, 1 point of gross margins is 100 basis points in ROIC. 10% reduction in P&E is 50 basis points in ROIC. David's big programs are around product cost and learning curve, huge in that business. You've heard him talk about that in the past.\r\nP&E efficiency, how can we get cheaper tooling on the same amount of the CapEx that we're installing in the business; engineering efficiency, and clearly, services productivity is a big driver of gross margins as well. And then that's how his team is compensated, and that feeds back to the results. So we've got kind of a virtuous cycle in terms of the new comp plan and how we think about operational simplification.\r\nNow we've been working on these things for long time. I think this is just a way for us to formalize it, be more transparent about it, but these are things that are important for the company. So we have a lot of work going on inside the company on product cost when it comes to what product managers do or what engineering teams and manufacturing teams have to do. This is a Turbomachinery example in our Oil & Gas business where we take 25% of this product cost out.\r\nStrategic sourcing, look, for us, for Steve and for David, precision casting is the #1 sourcing component, and if you're in the Aviation or the Power Generation business, we've got to find ways to get that cost down. And so we've got real programs in terms of how to focus there. Aviation learning curve, this is about both supply chain sourcing, how we make things. Value gap is about pricing. In the case of Aviation, getting more price per unit, products like Tier 4, where we have significant performance advantages, being able to get the pricing right the first time. Healthcare is really all about the original NPI. It's all about how do you get better cost out. No team in the company does it better than our Ultrasound team.\r\nAnd then we have a lot of service examples on productivity. Probably the most important thing we're doing right now is in CSAs and analytics, and you saw examples of that at Minds & Machines. So we've got tremendous programmatic focus on gross margins and ROIC kind of embedded into how we think about ROIC. We've talked about getting to 17% by end of 2016. By 2016, gross margins, we've talked about 50 basis points improvement on an annual basis.\r\nOur culture, we talked about simplification for the last couple of years. I think this is really resonating throughout the company. And when I talk about what we've done over the last couple of years here, Lean management, do fewer things but do them better, fewer layers, less structure, less process, fewer P&Ls, lower cost. I've stood up for a long time in terms of GE and asked people to do more with less. Now I'm asking them to do less, but do it better, Lean management, everything on the clock. So we've done Lean for 20 years in GE. We've added to that some process from Silicon Valley called the Lean Startup. We call it FastWorks. The H turbine has been launched in 2.5 years. The precursor to the H took 5 years, so real cycle time coming out in a real way.\r\nCommercial intensity, putting all the enabling functions, so they have to focus on the market, getting everybody engaged with what are the public customer metrics that we look at inside the company. And then the last element is really getting GE up to its digital entitlement. The fact is we can be leaner and faster if we just have the right IT tools as you think about the company and go forward.\r\nSo the Phase 1 of that was a lower-cost company, so getting down from 18% SG&A as a percentage of revenue down to 12%. We're well on our way. A faster, smarter company, this is FastWorks. This is gross margins and GE beliefs, right: Customer determines our success; stay lean to go fast; learn, improve, empower and inspire our people; and deliver results in an uncertain world. Those are good words for all of you in this room because that's the world we live in. That's where we live in today. So those are the things that are part of strategic execution inside the company.\r\nAnd then we've kind of solidified that with compensation. So the team is really on a very directed, financially clear plan where each business has financial goals that are kind of like we've done a long-term incentive plan for years. So these are 4 financial goals that really set the pool. The company kind of goal set the pool. Then, the businesses have to deliver on their 4 goals and then strategy as part of that in terms of deciding how much everybody gets paid. And for myself and the named executives, we now are all on some form of performance shares. So we're all kind of put our money totally aligned with investors. And then, again, going back to the Aviation example, 50% of our ROIC is very linear, financial. 50% is strategic. Do they get the LEAP out on time? Do they hit the right costs on the LEAP, things like that? And then that's filtered with the total company performance. So accountability, alignment, culture, all kind of part of the process of where the company is and the kinds of things we're doing, we think particularly good in the times we're in today.\r\nAnd so what does that mean overall? So I think in '15 -- like I said in '14, we'll see organic growth at the high end of the range, the 4% to 7% range. '15, we're talking about 2% to 5%. I'll go through Oil & Gas in a second, but we're really planning the company for a sluggish Oil & Gas sector in 2015. So we're at 15.7% margin in 2013, growth in '14, growth in '15, growth in '16. We have good momentum around margins and on track to hit our 17% ROIC goal by 2016. So organic growth, we've got a lot of good programs underway. Margins really underwriting any potential challenges in mix with better gross margin outperformance. In ROIC, a real focus on margin enhancement and capital efficiency going forward on returns. So in the end, our initiatives are all tied to better financial performance for the company and for the company going forward. So that's kind of the strategic overview of the company. \r\nNow kind of talking about 2015, so we're going to kind of change the way we communicate about the company in public. We know how endearing the pluses and pluses have become to everybody, but we thought, at least at the top of the house, we'd make it clearer and help people navigate through. So we're going to basically do 4 top line metrics.\r\nOne is Industrial EPS, and the Industrial EPS is a function of segments, corporate all the way down an Industrial EPS. And here, we're saying industrial EPS is in the range of $1.10 to $1.20. Industrial EPS will be up double digits, segment organic growth of 2% to 5%, margin expansion as part of that. Corporate will be somewhere between $2.3 billion and $2.5 billion, and we're basically saying, because they're so meaningful, Alstom and Appliances kind of close on July 1. So basically, we're kind of modeling the year as if M&A kind of all happens more or less at the same time. I think that's probably the smartest we are and the best way to kind of build the models.\r\nAt GE Capital, we're talking about $0.60 in 2015, smaller if we get a chance to make it smaller in an investor-friendly way, but we think this is a good base plan for people to think about. This basically assumes Synchrony happens on January 1, 2016. Again, just for planning purposes, this is the right way to think about it. If we have a chance to do it sooner, that's what we'll do.\r\nA number of free cash flow kind of plus dispositions, so kind of total cash generated, so this is CFOA minus P&E plus divestitures. So we're talking about CFOA of $14 billion to $16 billion, P&E between $4 billion and $4.5 billion and dispositions of $2 billion to $4 billion of cash received. So in other words, a lot of this has already been announced, so it's just getting cash in the door for that. And then cash returned to investors, a wide range here at $10 billion all the way to $30 billion, and that just includes dividend and the impact of buyback and Synchrony as you go through that. So these are the way to think about the company, the guideposts of the company, and now I'm going to take you kind of segment by segment in terms of how to think about where we are.\r\nSo we're going to leave the pluses just for the segments, but -- and I'm going to go through each segment individually. So I'm just going to -- this is really a summary page. But I just thought I'd spend a little bit of time on the high -- how to think about the high end and the low end of the range. \r\nSo I think the high end says the U.S. is better, that Healthcare in the U.S. continues to improve. I mean, it's -- third quarter was a little bit better. Fourth quarter, we think it's going to be okay. The business is taking a ton of cost out, so any incremental volume is pretty lucrative from a financial standpoint.\r\nAviation, Transportation, the history has been that as our customers earn more money, we earn more money. So if revenue passenger miles and spares and things like that stay where they are today, there's room for upside in some of these businesses.\r\nDecent Distributed Power and Wind business, these are very policy-driven businesses. So if you think about Distributed Power in countries that need electricity, when you think about wind, these tend to be more on the policy side, but see how that falls. Better cross execution, our sourcing should be better as we go into 2015, given the price of oil; that's a positive benefit of the price of oil. And then Alstom upside, again, we have a model, but these deals all happen in a different way once you close them.\r\nAnd then the low end of the range, it says, hey, what if instead of 3% plus global GDP growth that the IMF and everybody else forecast, what if it's actually lower than that because of other things that are happening in the world? We don't see that today, but we can accommodate some of that. We can accommodate Oil & Gas being worse and still be in the range. So we can accommodate more pressure there and still be in that earnings range.\r\nAnd we have a union contract here in 2015, so that always adds a little bit of variability. I always think about that in the context of what could happen.\r\nA public policy, hell, I have no idea if we're going to get tax reform or any of that stuff, so we don't know where that goes. And what if the dollar goes below $1.20? We've got to stress the plan to see what happens if really currency breaks out.\r\nBut the point I'd make for you is we've given you a pretty -- we've given you a range that can accommodate things getting worse and still be within that range. And that's probably the most important thing to think about at a moment like this. And if things are better, that's great for everybody, and that's how to think about it.\r\nSo Power & Water, when I'm going to show the businesses that have M&A, I'm going to show them with and without M&A. So if Alstom closes July 1, Steve and his team will have double-digit revenue and double-digit profit growth. If it doesn't close, just the core business has single-digit revenue and single-digit profit growth in Power & Water. We're not really assuming market growth per se. This is really a function of having really great products, so we have really good products versus our competition. We've got very good service execution on track. We have taken $1 billion of structural cost out of this business, so we've got a lean cost structure, and the team has been executing reasonably well. And what we try to do is hedge in here. You just get blue birds one way or the other, right. So in the Distributed Power side, this is really -- there's probably 5 or 10 deals we're working on at any given time that are just about emergency power and we try not to lean too heavily into those as being things to count on. And then you get the 6 months of Alstom in the -- Steve has responsibility for the power side. So that's kind of the base plan, so that's Power & Water.\r\nAviation, we basically talk about revenue up single digits and kind of profit growth ahead of that slightly and talk about a business that's really done extremely well over the last couple of years, extremely well positioned in the marketplace, winning in the OEM side, a good service franchise, a very strong service franchise. The negative mix is kind of in the run rate, so you kind of think about launching these engines. The first year stinks, but you already have that. So the GEnx kind of -- the GEnx cost comes down. Then, you introduce LEAP a couple of years from now, but basically, the badness you're going to feel from a product mix is already there. And investing to launch these new products, so still investing to launch new products. And military is going to continue to be tough. We don't see any good news vis-à-vis the military business, so that's going to be a drag on Aviation as it goes forward.\r\nOil & Gas. Oil & Gas, again, it is a flurry that's going around run this industry right now clearly. What I thought I'd do is just decompose the revenue on the cost side. So we basically have 5 segments. So the top line is we're counting on revenue being down slightly, and we're going to try to hold margins. That's kind of the base plan. So revenue's down, but we're taking a ton of cost actions, so that's kind of a -- we think, a reasonable plan.\r\nSo revenue, 5 segments. I start with Drilling & Surface. That's the most volatile piece of the mix. That's the first one that gets hit. We're counting on that being down more than 10% in revenue, so we've taken a fairly stark view on the Drilling & Surface business. \r\nAnd then you go to Subsea. Subsea is primarily oil, tough projects. Those projects are likely going to continue. In other words, people don't stop projects that are like this. So this is more than 70% backlog. We think orders are going to get hit in this business, but we see revenue playing through in '15 in all likelihood.\r\nAnd then Turbomachinery. Really, the LNG mix as a percentage of the global fuel is going to continue to grow. And as LNG fuel as a percentage of mix continues to grow, the completion of LNG projects goes forward, and so we see decent backlog in the Turbomachinery business. We see decent orders in the Turbomachinery business, and we've kind of modeled that to be okay next year. \r\nThe Measurement & Controls business, you have other people in your space like Honeywell and Emerson that are in that business. Some of that is MRO. A lot of it goes into the industries other than just oil and gas, so we kind of view that as being okay next year. And then the downstream is actually going to be better. So downstream projects are actually favored in the world we're in today. So we kind of see 60% of the portfolio revenue being okay. We see 15% where the revenue will continue, but orders are going to be very tough to come by. And we see 25% where revenue's going to be hard hit as you look at where it goes. So it's a diversified business. That's kind of how we do our planning for next year. I know on the cost side, we've been aggressive on both direct and base costs in the business, so we're well positioned for that. \r\nReally, one of the things that doesn't get written about a lot is the fact that even -- if you go back to the summer or before, there had been a lot of project inflation. A lot of our customers weren't that happy already with the projects and how they're being executed. So everybody in the industry was going through a cleanup process. And so we're already going through, even before Thanksgiving or OPEC or whatever you want to -- whatever you call [indiscernible] day, we were already doing a ton of restructuring, getting our costs out. Lorenzo already runs the business, and I would say, in a good way, as if oil prices were $60 or $70 a barrel. We look at projects -- when you talk to customers even before this, that's where they were. So we just want to continue that, and then we're just ready for the industry in times like this. So you've got to worry about pricing pressure. You've got to worry about a lot of stuff. \r\nSo we're not -- I think we've hedged this the right way. We've allowed room in the range in case things get worse, but we've been through these cycles before, SARS or power bubble or -- unfortunately, I've been doing this long enough. I could almost sing a song about all the crises I've seen. So I just put them all in a -- I just think we're just ready for this. And people ask me sometimes about -- I don't think this is the right time to do M&A. I like the space, guys. Let's be clear. I think over the long term, I like the space, just like I liked Aviation when it was tough, just like I liked all of our -- I like the -- we like this space. We like -- we think this is a good GE business. \r\nBut you don't have to buy things now. Really, I would say commercially, if you're in a -- this kind of turbulence, GE looks really good on almost every project we would ever work on versus anybody else, and so we just are going to -- we're going to position ourselves. We're going to run the place good for investors -- well for investors, and we like how this whole thing -- we like this business. We'd like it more at $120 per barrel. Don't get me wrong, but we like this business over the long term. \r\nHealthcare. We are prepared for more sluggishness. Again, I'd say Europe is still reasonably tough. The U.S. is a little bit better than where we've been. Japan has been extremely tough this year. Japan has been a very tough market in 2014. \r\nWe still see good growth in Life Sciences. That's more driven by drug discovery. We've taken a ton of costs out of this place, so we're well leveraged. Better products, what I talked about in the past. I think a better IT business. We basically missed the EMR wave in Healthcare, but we're pretty well positioned for the next wave in Healthcare in terms of applications that go with EMR. So we're pretty well positioned there. Still some uncertainty about what the Affordable Care Act is going to mean, but I would say we see people more willing to invest now than they were probably a year or 2 ago in terms of hospital CEOs, and so you're just going to have to be productive. So in Healthcare, we're counting on revenue growth, margin growth and slight profit growth in 2015. And if markets get better, we'll do better.\r\nI remind you in Transportation, as part of the Alstom deal, we're selling our signaling business to Alstom. So that's part of the transaction. That's why you see 2 comments here. So this year, a boomer in orders but more sluggish on revenue and margins, mainly because of the wheels business to Komatsu and to the mining space, so that's been a very tough year. We're not counting on the mining business getting any better. It's been a sluggish year, and we're kind of counting on a flat year, but we've got an incredible backlog now of locomotive. So this is going to have double-digit revenue growth, big backlog on orders. \r\nThe signaling business is pretty profitable, so that has an impact on margin rate, but -- so net-net, we'd have growing margins and growing revenue double digits. When you back out the signaling piece, you got operating profit growing positively and very strong backlog. So again, very well positioned. Technically, we've got the only Tier 4 locomotive, well positioned strategically in terms of where we are around the world, a good service franchise, a growing service franchise. \r\nMining, I think we have in a run rate now that's continuing to be soft. And what I worry about in a time like this and a business like this is we've got to take a brand new product. We've got to produce a bunch of them. We've got to take it down the learning curve, so this is not a market challenge. This is more of an execution challenge that I worry about in this business when I think about 2015.\r\nEnergy Management is really 3 businesses, and we're going to get -- again, Alstom has a big participation here. So without business development, you'd have single-digit revenue growth and a double-digit operating profit growth. With Alstom, you're going to have strong revenue growth and strong op profit growth. We've done a bunch of restructuring in this business, and we should have a decent year in Energy Management. \r\nI'll break it down into 3 pieces. Power Conversion is an essential technology for the company. Electrification is an essential technology, but we have had to put a ton of money into fixing this franchise. So we have really had to reinvest into this space, quite honestly, more than we thought we were going to have to, but we are really well poised to see a couple of good years of earnings growth in the Power Conversion business. It reminds me a little bit of the wind business back a decade ago. The wind business, for the first couple of years we owned it, we had to reinvest back in the product line. We had to clean up the installed base. It was terrible for probably 3 years, and then it just has generated a boatload of cash since then. I look at Power Conversion kind of the same way. \r\nDigital Energy is all about Alstom. Digital Energy is all about -- they're #3. We're #6. Together, we're a stronger #3. You've got ABB and Siemens, #1 and #2. ABB, in particular, earns mid-teens margins. Together, we're going to earn like 6 -- maybe 6% margins. There is a huge amount of margin runway when you think about those businesses and where you can go. \r\nAnd then Industrial Solutions, we've done a lot of restructuring. We're going to get good earnings growth. We'll probably -- I'd say in a year or 2, we'll be at or above 10% operating profit rate in the industrial systems business, and I think this is a business that's always got optionality. It's a better fit with Alstom, but it's a business that we always think about from an investor-friendly standpoint in terms of where we go. Our job in the short term is to make it better -- to make it much better.\r\nAppliances goes, so really, from a Lighting standpoint, it's just an LED story. We'll cross $1 billion on LEDs. This is really a -- more of an infrastructure service business today. It's a vastly different business, and then we've got to clean up. One way, shape or form, we've just got to clean up the old installed base around Lighting, but that's kind of where it is. Appliances, I think, we'll get a gain that, let's say, $0.07 -- $0.06, $0.07 a share of a gain that we're going to apply back to restructuring and other stuff around the company. So that's really Appliances & Lighting.\r\nCorporate, which has been -- kind of just a lot going on in Corporate. I think it's just going to be easier and simpler to understand, so we're going to continue to take costs, just pure run rate costs, out of Corporate. We expect gains to offset restructuring. So this year, we did 1 billion -- just a $0.10 plus of naked restructuring, right. So that's been a hurt to the company. That just goes away. So gains are going to offset restructuring next year, variability based on when you do it. The places where we're reinvesting are going to be places like the software COE is going to be the biggest place that we reinvest at Corporate. \r\nA ton going on in pension. We try to spell it out for you here in terms of what happens both in terms of interest rates and mortality tables and things like that. I would encourage you, if you're really curious about that stuff to talk to Jeff during the cocktail hour. My Ph.D. was in something other than mortality tables, but -- and then I think just simpler. Look, I just think as we're going through the big restructuring program, this has been a hard thing to track through. I think next year, we're really saying $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion, very transparent, part of the industrial EPS and kind of how we think about the company going forward.\r\nCapital allocation. Again, we talk about capital allocation in terms of '15 and '16. Again, given the -- just the Synchrony dynamic, I think, makes this a better way to look at it. So a real focus on free cash flow, our CFOA less P&E driving good improvement inside the businesses in terms of where we go on CFOA. Synchrony is going to allow for a great tax capital-efficient transaction for investors. Capital dividend, we're assuming that, that continues. And we're saying, in addition to the things that have already been announced, so like Appliances and things like that, always around the edges, there's at least, let's say, $2 billion of divestitures every year that we just view as just optionality, cleanup, things like that, and we would expect to have that in 2015 as well. \r\nAnd then from an allocation standpoint, $40 billion returned to investors in terms of the Synchrony split and dividends. Alstom is really the priority here, guys. I really -- this is our M&A plan, I would say, into '15 and '16, other than things that are around the edges. We want to do a good job on Alstom, and then we still invest a lot organically in terms of the company and the business and where it's going. So that's the financial plan. So we're saying $1.10 to $1.20 industrial EPS. That's up double digits versus this year. $0.60 on capital, could be smaller if we get an opportunity to do so in an investor-friendly way and then giving you a target for total cash generated, $12 billion to $15 billion free cash flow and cash given back to investors of $10 billion to $30 billion, depending on Synchrony and where we go.\r\nSo again, just to recap on the company. Look, we have an awesome infrastructure company that is focused on returns. It is competitively well positioned. It is going to be earning a substantial amount and increasing it over the years. And in GE Capital, that's really based on returns and competitive advantage, are going to dictate the size of GE Capital over time. So very -- I think a very strong portfolio in the world we live in today. \r\nAnd then just continuing to improve what I would say the horizontal capability inside the company, and that is product, but not just product innovation, but better manufacturing costs around the products. It is a fantastic global and growth market footprint. It is this merger of physical and digital -- really, owning the analytical space and doing a better job of taking costs out of our company. It is having a very strong service franchise, which we think in slow growth and volatile times is a good underpinning for the company, and we've made great strides to make the service business even better. Intense focus on gross margins and return on invested capital and momentum already in place to achieve that and a focus on accountability and simplification.\r\nAnd then not to go crazy on forward guidance, clearly, but there's so much going on in the portfolio, I just want to give you a -- how I would think about the company going forward into '16. So you're going to lose Synchrony earnings. Capital's going to be, let's say, $0.40 a share, plus or minus, right. That's where it's going to be. Then you take an industrial business, you basically -- you got restructuring equal gains, that adds. You got a buyback, that adds. You got Alstom, that adds. And then you got -- let's say you just target 5% to 10% organic growth. You've got industrial earnings that more than offset capital going down, so we're growing EPS this year. We're going to grow EPS next year. We're going to grow EPS in '16, and we're going to do it while massively changing the portfolio in the world where we see today and kind of underwriting some negative risk, and that's how we think about the company in '15 and '16 going forward. \r\nSo last thing I'd just say it's a different company. We've got to run it -- we've got to think about it in a different context. I've got to think about it in a different context. I would say massively portfolio ins and outs, those days of big changes, I'm not saying we won't ever change anything, shift to getting the most out of the portfolio we have, improving returns. Improving returns industrially, we think we can get to 17% and improving returns in GE Capital. We've got to get GE Capital above 10%, and so this is a team that's going to get measured, managed, compensated based on generating good returns out of the portfolio we have, point number one.\r\nPoint number two, if you look at the blended talent at the top, there's nobody in headquarters that hasn't come recently from a business. We just basically have more intense operating focus at every point in the place, and I think that's a good thing. I'm not sure I would ever again have people in the corporate top of the house that hadn't been in a business in a substantial way. I just think you get a different sensibility when you do that, and it's particularly important since I've been in the job for a while that you get new agitation that comes into that. \r\nI'd say point number three, I read all the notes you guys write about all of our competitors. I read almost everywhere. I don't read everywhere, but I read almost everywhere. And yes, Scott, especially with you. But any time you stop investing, you die in this business, right. But I think we had the flaw or I had the flaw sometimes of investing in too many things. I think what has to happen now is you've got to be investing in -- more in -- if you launch new products, you got to get the costs out. Analytics are going to improve the productivity and margins of all of our service portfolio. Globally, when we go to a country, we go there not just to sell. We go there to drive productivity at the same time, so I really see a dramatic change in the way we invest about the share and margins. But any time you stop investing, if you decide to sit out the next round of narrow bodies, you lose for 30 years. If you decide to sit out the next round of large flat gas turbines, you lose for 30 years. So investment is part of what we do in these companies, but the investment has to be narrower and deeper, and I think that's important. \r\nModernizing the capability, you want us to be better at analytics and IT. You want us to be better at analytics and IT. I'm just telling you that flat out, that's got to be a core competency in where we go. \r\nAnd monetizing the culture, leaner, faster, risk-based, competitive. It's just a different place. It's a better place. It's a different place. It's important for us to be positioned where we need to get to in the future. \r\nSo with that, let me stop there and take questions. Scott, let's start with you. Do we have mics?",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Jeffrey Immelt (Executives)】\nRight, let's get started. All the forward-looking stuff, okay? We'll get right to business. A year ago, I -- we stood here, and we talked about kind of an outline for the year. It was going to be an active year, and I think we've done what we set out to do: aggressive portfolio reshaping underway; good industrial execution, including a ton of restructuring. So over the last few years, we've done more than $4 billion of restructuring to improve the cost base of the company. Simpler structure, smaller GE Capital and focus on returns. So I think as I go through this pivot in 2015 and '16, what you're going to see is the world's best infrastructure company where every business in the company leverages the core competency and very tightly, the core capability of the company; $40 billion returned to investors over the next few years in dividends and the Synchrony split, so kind of what we outlined last year is underway; substantial EPS tailwind with restructuring Alstom, buyback, not having restructuring exceed gains, industrial execution. Smaller GE Capital, we continue to make it smaller and cultural simplification and accountability, and I'll talk about all those things today. And the output of that is going to be a good, solid, double-digit EPS growth for the next few years. An output of it is earnings, industrial earnings exceeding 75% of our total earnings and expanding margins and returns. So I'm going to talk about all these things -- all of these things as we go through today.\r\nWatchers of CNBC, you know there's a lot going on in the world, so that's kind of the mode we're in today. Some of them are better. I'd say the U.S. economy still feels like it's getting better. Air travel, rail travel, quite strong even today. U.S. healthcare around the edges, getting a little bit better. Some thing's the same. Most of the growth markets are the same. Natural gas prices, power demand remains the same, and certain things clearly under stress, so oil prices down, Russia tough, FX, things like that. So it's just a slow growth, full of volatility. It's kind of what we've seen since the financial crisis. Things get magnified in the short term, and that's kind of the world that we live in. But we still think there's plenty of growth out there to be had and as you pick through and go through the world.\r\nNow oil price decline, I'm going to talk a little bit more about the Oil & Gas business in a little while, but we've been through cycles before. So we prepare all our businesses to go through a cycle, so Lorenzo and his team are working on cost out. Even before the oil prices went down, the Oil & Gas customers were really focused on improving the quality of the projects. We've been working on product standardization, things like that, for a long time. That's all going to get accelerated. And we're going to be able to pick through customers and projects that we want. I think if you're a big oil company in a time like this, GE looks better as a supplier during a time like this, so we like our competitive position. And we're going to look for opportunities, vis-à-vis share, people that we can hire, things like that.\r\nAnd the rest of it kind of looks like fine. There's puts and takes, but the rest of the company looks fine. And I always find sometimes we're in the middle of one of these big macro kind of distractions and things like that. It's good to think about micro a little bit. So I've been going to China for 25 years, China's okay. The micro of China for -- in the Aviation business, the Healthcare business, a lot of -- the power business, China's fine. If you're in the commercial real estate business in China, not so good. We're not there in commercial real estate, so China's is okay.\r\nIn the resources places, if you're a low-cost producer like Saudi, you're still going forward. If you're a marginal producer like Iraq, Venezuela, it's going to be tough. It's going to be tough. I always have to remind people, the country that where still is GE most hedged to is the United States because the United States does better. Because of low gas prices, that is great for us. If low gas prices are felt broadly in Europe and U.S. and China, that's going to be good for GE.\r\nAviation and Transportation, the commercial spares rate, average daily order rate today is higher than any time I can ever remember. We will set record orders this year in locomotives. So when you think about the micro, it's just a little bit of a different perspective.\r\nAnd then in the power market, we're working on some of our biggest power deals that we've ever had that are -- some of which will be announced yet this year on power projects. So people need electricity. They're going to still invest in power projects.\r\nSo the micro is still okay. There's going to be pockets -- clearly, with oil prices down, there's going to be pockets of that get filled in. But I think looking at the micro sometimes is helpful as you go through things like this.\r\nOur framework on the year, we're still on track for the Industrial double-digit segment growth for the year and margin expansion, organic growth and margin expansion. My sense, we said revenues in the quarter would be above the high end of the range. That still looks like what we're tracking to. And revenue for the year will be close to the high end of the range, organic growth. That's what's still what we're tracking to in 2014.\r\nCapital's tracking more to a $6.9 billion number than a $6.7 billion number. We're going to do more restructuring and charges in the quarter, a couple of pennies more. Again, we've done a ton of restructuring this year, guys, without gains. So going forward, we're going to go back to gains offsetting restructuring, but this year, to get ready for the Synchrony spin, get our industrial costs down, we've been very aggressive with restructuring this year.\r\nCFOA is tracking towards the middle of that range on CFOA. And revenues, I already went through in terms of how we're tracking for organic growth for the year. So that's kind of the framework as we look at it this year.\r\nAnd now I'm going to switch to kind of a strategic update, and then, at the end, I'll go through segment by segment and give you how we're looking at 2015. So look, we're tracking to have the world's best infrastructure company. By '16, more than 75% of our earnings are going to be an output of that, and a smaller GE Capital. Every business in the industrial sector can leverage all of our capabilities, what we call the GE Store: technology, services, global footprint; simple structure. Every business is going to be able to fully leverage that and take advantage of it. A good, solid industrial EPS growth through the period and a smaller Financial Services and one that's based really on competitive advantage and returns when we think about the total portfolio.\r\nWe've done a lot of work over the last 10 years on the portfolio. I would say a couple of things industrially. We're just more diversified industrially within each business, and we've exited all the industrial businesses that didn't fit the infrastructure model. So we've exited Appliances, plastics, silicones, business like that.\r\nWhen I stood here, let's say, in 2002, more than 50% of our earnings came from 1 product and 1 market. F turbines in the United States was 50% of the company's industrial earnings. So we have very actively, within Healthcare, within power, within Aviation broadened our capability. And so I like standing here today with the set of infrastructure businesses that all utilize our core advantage and have more capability in their industries, more profit pools inside their industries, and that's what we have here today. \r\nThen on the Financial Services side, smaller. Look, we exited insurance in time. I think we got too big in consumer finance, and we had to go backwards on that but really, focus on a smaller Financial Service business, doing things within our control. And I think Synchrony is going to turn out to be a good trade for investors as we go through this.\r\nSo focus on staying close to domain, doing deals of the right size, really generating strong returns in the synergies. These are the things as I look forward in the company going forward. And I think where we stand here today, just less portfolio activity and very tight focus on returns, very tight focus on returns as we stand here today thinking about the portfolio and where we stand.\r\nWe did 3 big deals in 2014: Alstom, which I'll talk a little bit more about, in a sector we know very well, complementary, financially attractive, generating synergies, high-double digit returns, high-teens returns. \r\nSynchrony, that we've done, the first part of Synchrony. We've asked for you to model Synchrony as if we'll have it for the full year in 2015, but we're going to look to execute on the remainder of Synchrony as soon as we can in the year, but that's just for modeling purposes, the way I think about it. Look, based on current pricing and things like that, this is going to be attractive, maybe as much as 700 million shares, plus or minus, that we're going to be able to exchange and a big gain in Synchrony. \r\nAnd then Appliances, we think we did a fair trade, another gain in the Appliance business, attractive buyer. So these are 3 big deals that we did this year that we think executed on the strategy in an important way.\r\nSo with Synchrony, what does capital look like? I'd say, by the end of 2015 x Synchrony, we'll be below $300 billion of ENI. We'll continue to exit Australia, central and European banks, things like that. We're focused on the verticals or places where we have a competitive advantage. We're going to be building regulatory capability and look to enter the CCAR process in 2017 and focus on improving returns.\r\nAnd then I always hate to give kind of single-point guidance, but I find with GE Capital, it's helpful for investors just to know how we're thinking about it. I would think about $0.60 a share in 2015, and with Synchrony out and fewer gains and things like that, about $0.40 a share in '16. We're still thinking about ways in an investor-friendly way to continue to reduce the size of GE Capital, driving a consistent dividend and improving returns in terms of the business and where it is.\r\nIn terms of Alstom, we're in the midst of the integration process. There's -- we've got more than 300 people working on this full time. There's things we know and can talk about. There's things we -- they're still a public company, so I'm limited in terms of how much I can really say. But the synergy pipeline's robust. They've got good people. They've got good factories. They've got good people. Its products and technologies we know. It dramatically expands the global operations of the company in an important way. What is -- as expected, the technology is kind of what we knew it was; where it fits. In some places, it's much better than what we have, particularly in areas of grid, but very complementary.\r\nThe people, we've known. When we did the EGT acquisition in the late '90s, these were all Alstom folks, so we know them quite well.  The government processes and compliance monitors are on track within our deal case, so that's important. We've hired some ex-Bechtel people to go through the EPC process with us to learn a lot about the project, so we're going through that. So far, it looks like a pretty good capability. And the first half cash was lower than they expected and due to tough markets, but it's going to improve in the second half, and we already see a pathway on that.\r\nSo that's kind of the update. We're -- for the planning purposes, we're counting on a mid-2015 close. Let's say, midyear, so that seems to be a pretty decent assumption vis-à-vis where we are today.\r\nThis goes back to last April when we laid out the synergy plan. We talked about $400 million of synergies and supply chain and services, and that looks pretty good. There's a 10-point margin delta between our service business and their service business, so that looks like a pretty good place to hunt. 1,000 combined sites, 1/3 of which are in the same city; that looks like a decent place to hunt. And like I said, the manufacturing processes are quite good. We're quite impressed with their manufacturing team, and we like what they're doing.\r\nThere's a ton of juice in sourcing. There's like $1 billion -- more than $1 billion that either 1 of us buy that the other company makes, right. So if you slap on a 20% margin on that, you wake up in the morning with just $200 million just by replacing suppliers, and that looks pretty good, $12 billion combined buy. Technology, very complementary skills.\r\nIf you look at our SG&A benchmarks versus theirs, there appears to be a decent amount of synergies. So the synergies look pretty good. And then we didn't really count on any growth synergies, but when you look at the global footprint, when you look at the aspects of where they are and some of the things we think we can do with the installed base, there seems to be some reason to think that there might be some growth synergies.\r\nSo we've kind of laid out for you, this was -- this is going to be $0.01 accretive in 2015 all in. In '16, it's $0.06 to $0.09 accretive and then ought to grow from there. So high-teens return and improved strategic position, we like the way Alstom is lining out so far. A ton of potential, just a ton of potential, but it's going to take our best effort, and we're going to have to dedicate a lot of people, a lot of management time to it to be successful in this field.\r\nAnd then you look at just what the combined entity looks like. From an infrastructure standpoint, this is a fine company. This is a fine set of businesses. We ought to have a couple of years of -- with the Alstom synergies and the buyback and just organic -- reasonable organic growth and gains and restructuring offsetting. You're going to get a couple of strong years as far as we can see with -- in the environment we see today of good earnings growth. You've got a strong set of #1 franchises that are in this business, all of which can leverage the GE core. It makes the company's core capabilities even stronger, so it makes us a better technology company. It strengthens our hand in growth markets. It gives us probably more than a $200 billion service backlog. We think there's opportunity for incremental returns here. Just getting the Alstom synergies is quite strong, but it also is going to play into the work we're doing on ROIC and gross margins and more scale on a simpler foundation. And we're going to be in the middle of global infrastructure, energy transitions, growth markets, efficiency, environmental investing, a whole series of things. So you're going to have a great-looking industrial company going forward really built on our GE capability.\r\nAnd the GE capability looks something like this. We talk about this a lot of different ways a lot of different times, but in some way, shape or form, we've talked about the same 4 initiatives for the last decade or so. This is a great technology company that spreads ideas throughout the company with a global research center, a legitimate global research center that spreads ideas. This is a fantastic global company that's got a global growth organization led by a Vice Chairman who sits in Hong Kong, where we have a very strong franchise in all these countries around the world. It's fantastic with services and customers, with a software COE, a service counsel and some of the best service operations in the world. And it's a -- this Lean culture heading towards 12% SG&A as a percentage of revenue with cultural development, training and development and things like that. And every one of our industrial businesses now can trade fully on this capability.\r\nAt the same time, every one of the businesses adds to this capability. So in the case of aircraft engines, aircraft engines is a first mover on engineering productivity material science. Aviation is the business that delivered CMCs, which power business now uses, and additive manufacturing that the Healthcare business now uses.\r\nHealthcare is the anchor tenant in every growth market around the world. We had 2,000 employees in Healthcare in the year 1999. All of the original staffing for the power business, the Aviation business came from Healthcare. Most of the diagnostics technology we use across the service installed base comes from Healthcare.\r\nTransportation business brings combustion science, engine technology, localization, again, a first mover in lot of the countries around the world.\r\nThe power business really brings the services installed base and the services capability. The power business has 17 facilities that every business, Transportation, Oil & Gas, uses. Oil & Gas has been the first mover in Africa and lots of other hard places to get to, brings a ton in service technology, great applications and controls. Energy Management, all of the power conversion, electrification controls technology comes from Energy Management back into the GE Store. So I think as you think about this, what makes GE work? It's this very strong core competency and a very great capability built around these core aspects in terms of who we are and what we do, and that's the GE Store.\r\nNow we're going to make the GE Store better. So a lot about what we've been executing on in the past and a lot about what we're going to be doing in the future is built really on this page. And then I'm going to amplify it in the future -- in the next couple of pages.\r\nTechnology today isn't just about delivering new features. You also have to deliver it at a fundamentally lower cost point. We're doing technologies and manufacturing at the same time. When we invest in R&D, we're investing as much in manufacturing as we have any time in our history, absolutely key, absolutely key. We are going to be a huge player in globalization and in growth markets. We're going to have the world's biggest franchise with a ton of localization capability.\r\nThree, we really do believe that every industrial company, everybody in your universe is going to have to be basic and analytics and information technology. We fundamentally believe that. And we're putting our money where our mouth is, and we're going to continue to do that, and we think we're going to win doing that.\r\nFour, based on all of those things, I think we have underwritten the healthiest service franchise in the world. Your highest margin as an investor, your most valuable asset is the installed base, we've made that even more valuable, and I'll show you the ways we're going to do that in the future.\r\nFive, we're going to take simplification that we've talked about on our structural cost, and we are in the midst of driving that massively into gross margins and ROIC. So we've got a lot of juice there, and we're going to continue to be -- use that to be able to drive our margins.\r\nAnd six, just the strong culture of simplification and accountability are critical in terms of how we look at the future driving FastWorks and the other parts of the company. So this is really executing our strategy.\r\nWe've got great products. Our products differentially are the best that I can remember. On a differential basis, we've got a great position. H turbine, highest efficient, largest gas turbine in the world. It's a bigger part of the segment. We've got 37 technical wins. We are going to really do a great job with the H turbine.\r\nTier 4 locomotive, we're nearly the only one approved to get a lot of orders, and that's how I started my career, with selling Lexan. We were the only polycarbonate company in the world. We thought we were geniuses as salespeople. When you have the only one, it's a good thing, right.\r\nLEAP engine, our win rate is huge right now on the LEAP. We're doing quite well in terms of how we're positioned. This is going to be a huge launch on the LEAP engine.\r\nPET/MR, I was at the RSNA, and we had the best alignment of new products I can remember in a long time. We were behind Siemens on the PET/MR. It's much better. Our MR product line, CT product line, ultrasound, we just we look really good in the healthcare sector right now.\r\nLots of Oil & Gas innovation. 20k BOP is going to get launched. It's highly efficient and highly effective. And Power Conversion is a very important horizontal capability in terms of the company and is going to see some good growth for GE going forward. So we really have a great array of products right at the right time, ready to launch.\r\nBut we're also making them in a different way. When we increased our R&D as a percentage of revenue from 4% to 5%, that extra piece, a lot of it went into manufacturing technology. And that's going to pay off for our investors as we do that in a number of important ways.\r\nMaterials and additives, you've heard us talk about -- you've heard Dave Joyce talk about CMCs but also this strong manufacturing capability that we bring across the product line.\r\nDesign and test, this is unsexy as hell, but we have a test stand in Greenville that can do full-load gas turbine testing. It is awesome. You can now take the product. We can iterate the product. We can bring customers to see the product. People will insure the product. Insurance companies will insure the product. Testing is a massive advantage and something that we have a leadership position in.\r\nI would say the choice to do vertical integration, with the way we design our products now, we basically own all the designs. We can choose how much we want to chew off on vertical integration, but we're going to get more margin. We're either going to get it through lower sourcing pricing or by doing more ourselves. \r\nAnd just digitalization, we're taking all of the things we talked about in Minds & Machines, and we're applying that back into our own factories.\r\nSo if you if you look at the LEAP, the LEAP has got a lower starting point and a faster learning curve than the GEnx. It's been designed more efficiently than the GEnx and is going to have a lower fundamental cost. And as you guys know, as Dave would tell you with the LEAP, 1 or 2 points either way is worth hundreds of millions of dollars over the lifetime of the product.\r\nAnd the H turbine is going to start with a lower initial cost and with a faster learning curve, more productivity than any of the products we've ever introduced. So we really have aligned cost and technology very well in this process.\r\nWe're going to be a $60 billion -- GE plus Alstom is $60 billion in growth markets. We're just profoundly well positioned in just about every country that counts around the world. It's going to give us scale. It's going to give us competitive advantage. It's going to improve our scope. But when you look at a place like China, we'll have probably close to 30 factories, real critical mass across the entire company.\r\nIndia, that's a place where Alstom was superior to GE, has a very strong leadership team, more factories and better position in India. Middle East, North Africa and Turkey, I talk about that, Alstom really adds to the capability and mass of the company going forward. So we now as a company are not only bigger than our competition but can really utilize and play any game strategically on a global basis, big competitive advantage.\r\nWe also have the software that goes with it. I think in the world we live in today, you just can't miss anything, right. So you're going to have to be present and get the incremental businesses that exist around the world, and you've got to do that in a cost-effective and efficient way at the same time.\r\nSo on localization, we are around the big deals as they take place. China's going to be a very active market next year in the aviation sector, lots of campaigns that we're going to have to be focused on. Most of them, they're robotic campaigns.\r\nLike I said, emergency power, you're going to see deals yet this year that are in the emergency power space, people that need electricity. You've got to be well positioned. No 2 of these deals are the same, but when you look at a deal like Algeria, these are very important for the company strategically. We'll do about 1,000 locomotives around the world between '15 and '18. We're well positioned in a lot of places globally there.\r\nWe can compete any place in the world from a value healthcare standpoint, so can go against Mindray or others at high margins in the markets around the world. And even with oil, where it is, there's going to be some big projects in Africa next year on Subsea and Oil & Gas that GE is going to participate in and look at and work hard on. So localization helps drive growth. But by being local in these markets, we also have more presence that can improve our productivity and cost at the same time.\r\nNow one of the things that John Rice has done as we've gone globally is really invested in these multi-modality sites. So as we invest globally, no site now is one GE business. It's multiple GE businesses. I show you here just Haiphong and Pune in India, but that's about $500 million of output, 20% savings, and we're doing this more and more on a global basis.\r\nEngineering centers, one of the metrics that we look is operating cost per hour. So when you look at Mexico and Poland from an engineering standpoint, they have an operating cost per hour of 20% or 30% below the rest of the world. And shared services, we're doing in 5 centers now on a global basis. So globalization is giving us both a cost base and a revenue base that, again, I think, makes us very competitive in the world we live in today.\r\nThis comes from Minds & Machines. We basically discussed the investments we're making in analytics, about $300 million to $400 million a year, and this is going to add to a higher service growth rate, more dollars per installed base and higher service margins, better product feedback. It also connects us more closely to our customers. And this is still ongoing. This is still -- we're still making a ton of progress along these lines.\r\nAnd we also talked about our own investment in information technology. That helps us get our 1% and helps us be more efficient with our installed base in manufacturing. And so these are things that we're going to talk about at every meeting, give you updates on and let you know how we're doing and what our capability is.\r\nOne of the important horizontal capabilities that we're investing in around the company is in controls. Controls is a critical horizontal capability for the industrial Internet. We now can take controls and back fit them in to B- and E-class turbines, the old installed base. When you do that, you open up their ability to accept the industrial Internet or accept software and analytics on top of that. We think this is going to give us a chance to drive better upgrades around the installed base.\r\nLife optimizing controls, we're doing around all the wind turbines. This allows us to improve their uptime. This gives us ways to substantially grow the service franchise for our wind business by double digits even in a sluggish or tougher market. So controls, new technology, new ways to think about the future.\r\nIn the case of locomotives, look, our rail customers are going to allow us to be their operating ERP. This shows a real live example of a locomotive customer. We have 8 different software offerings that we're selling to this customer. It's -- the potential for each 1 of the locomotive customers is about $100 million of incremental revenue each year, dramatically increasing the dollars per installed base. The ones that don't have numbers associated with them, we're doing today, and the 1, 2, 3 are new offerings, new bids that we're driving. So this is real-time accelerating growth in our service business.\r\nAnd in the case of information technology, we're aggressively driving ERP reduction, application reduction, more knowledge inside the company. And I'll just show you 2 businesses here, our Water business and our Life Science business. And as we've been able to collapse the structure of these businesses that were largely built through acquisitions, we've grown our operating profit substantially over that time period. Both of these franchises have return on capital of 15% or more. And so we're able to use the simplification of the structure and the information technology to drive better margins, lower SG&A, better returns on all these businesses going forward.\r\nSo better products, better global footprint, the intersection of physical and digital, and that investment in physical and digital leads us to really underwriting an incredibly important and valuable piece of turf for our investors, which is our installed base. We see steady growth. We're going to have another good year in '14 in services of organic growth, margins and backlog. We expect another strong year in '15. We're growing our dollars per installed base by 3%, which is very healthy. That's a good level for us. Our margins are up substantially in services this year. Our incremental software sales are strong. Our Predictivity orders will exceed $1.5 billion, and we're now looking back at this aged fleet where our penetration is lower, whether it's jet engines or locomotives or gas turbines and licking our chops about where that could go in the future. Alstom adds 35% to our installed base and there's a 10-point service differential in terms of margins there. So we see some good opportunities in our -- in -- with the acquisition.\r\nGE brings a ton in technology. We bring a lot in terms of global footprint and Alstom actually has quite a good service business as well, particularly around the multi-vendor service and aged fleet. So we think there's a ton of complementary synergies in terms of where we stand here.\r\nSo number four is this big focus on services' profit -- long-term profit, huge backlog. Alstom's right in the sweet spot here. And this is a place where our performance is actually getting better each day, and we like where we are.\r\nI thought I'd just take you through one business as an example, an important business, which is Power Gen Services, just to allow you to see whereas you used to have how big your installed base grew was the only determinant of whether you made more money in services year after year, you now have 5 or 6 engines that are growing simultaneously in terms of the power business. So you've always got new products. And our close rate, whether it's in aircraft engines or locomotives or Healthcare, our close rate around new technology with CSA is always huge. So you only start close to 100% on CSA close rate.\r\nThen you add to that upgrades. You hear us talking about Advanced Gas Paths, which will be about 80, and there'll be even more next year. But on top of that, we also do upgrades to a lot of our other old fleets in terms of where we go with a ton of margin dollars associated with that.\r\nWe'll have $300 million of just software sales in the business. That's probably twice what it was in 2014. And we're going after the B and E class of fleets, so we're going after the old aged fleet with new controls and analytics. We've got a great global footprint, so our close rate globally is as high. Our close rate is as high in Australia, China, places like that, than it is in the United States, and we're generating $350 million, $400 million of productivity every year. So you march through there, and we're just changing the game around our service businesses. And I could tell the same story in Aviation or Healthcare, other businesses, so really critical.\r\nSo products, global, physical and digital, that leads to better service and service outcome and then a real focus on just intensifying kind of wing-to-wing process improvement. We've done a good job on SG&A, getting down to 12% of SG&A. I view that as the right place to start because it's not only cost that we could take out but also made running the place easier. So that's key. We've always worked on the other buckets, but we're just doing this with more focus and intensity, so setting real gross margin targets, contribution margin, less R&D. And as you do SG&A and as you do gross margins, 80% of -- more or less 80% of our ROIC or our returns improvements are driven by margin growth. Then, we add to that a focus on better capital intensity, a better capital usage down there, free cash flow conversion.\r\nSo we're basically saying, look, we're on a pathway to get to 12% by 2016 in terms of SG&A. We started in '13 at 27% segment gross margins. We want to get 50 basis points annually on gross margins. And we told you last year we wanted to get to 17% ROIC, and we're on a path to do that. So the new metric today, let's say, is around gross margins and improvement we want to see there.\r\nTo do that, you got to focus on what we call the axes. You got to focus on the critical projects, the critical areas. They're going to really move the needle and make those a horizontal capability inside the company. So for us, there's really 8 of them. It's product cost, which goes without saying, when you're in a high-tech infrastructure business, product cost, that's just about everything we do. Operating cost per hour, so that's a blended average of how we engineer, where we make things and we put everything on a common basis. Value gap, which is really a comparison of how you sell versus how you buy, so critical in terms of to see if you're recovering inflation. Engineering efficiency in big businesses like Aviation, this is really key, and there's ways that we can measure engineering output. Service productivity is something we share with you all the time.  Reliability in a business like Transportation, any businesses that have big CSA portfolios, reliability is a critical determinant of how you ultimately drive margin into your installed base. P&E efficiency goes without saying, and working capital turns is a common one.\r\nAnd so converge on metrics, horizontal process, Dan Heintzelman and Jeff Bornstein and the corporate audit staff focused on that. Compensation linked to metrics -- linked to outcome metrics and making sure that the -- that all the projects give us room for mix because that is the hardest thing to predict. And I would say that's the place where we'd whiffed in the past, and so we just have to set the bar higher that can accommodate different mix formulas inside the company.\r\nAnd then I show you in the end how does it work in a real-time example, and again, to pick on David, but he's doing a good job. You all think that, I think, so -- as I sure do. So Aviation has 25% gross margins, 7% SG&A, 18% returns, 90% cash conversion. So if you look at a business like Aviation, the things that stand out are gross margins, not SG&A, and he's been in a heavy CapEx cycle launching all these engines. We got -- just have to drive more efficiency in the CapEx cycle. So in the Aviation business, 1 point of gross margins is 100 basis points in ROIC. 10% reduction in P&E is 50 basis points in ROIC. David's big programs are around product cost and learning curve, huge in that business. You've heard him talk about that in the past.\r\nP&E efficiency, how can we get cheaper tooling on the same amount of the CapEx that we're installing in the business; engineering efficiency, and clearly, services productivity is a big driver of gross margins as well. And then that's how his team is compensated, and that feeds back to the results. So we've got kind of a virtuous cycle in terms of the new comp plan and how we think about operational simplification.\r\nNow we've been working on these things for long time. I think this is just a way for us to formalize it, be more transparent about it, but these are things that are important for the company. So we have a lot of work going on inside the company on product cost when it comes to what product managers do or what engineering teams and manufacturing teams have to do. This is a Turbomachinery example in our Oil & Gas business where we take 25% of this product cost out.\r\nStrategic sourcing, look, for us, for Steve and for David, precision casting is the #1 sourcing component, and if you're in the Aviation or the Power Generation business, we've got to find ways to get that cost down. And so we've got real programs in terms of how to focus there. Aviation learning curve, this is about both supply chain sourcing, how we make things. Value gap is about pricing. In the case of Aviation, getting more price per unit, products like Tier 4, where we have significant performance advantages, being able to get the pricing right the first time. Healthcare is really all about the original NPI. It's all about how do you get better cost out. No team in the company does it better than our Ultrasound team.\r\nAnd then we have a lot of service examples on productivity. Probably the most important thing we're doing right now is in CSAs and analytics, and you saw examples of that at Minds & Machines. So we've got tremendous programmatic focus on gross margins and ROIC kind of embedded into how we think about ROIC. We've talked about getting to 17% by end of 2016. By 2016, gross margins, we've talked about 50 basis points improvement on an annual basis.\r\nOur culture, we talked about simplification for the last couple of years. I think this is really resonating throughout the company. And when I talk about what we've done over the last couple of years here, Lean management, do fewer things but do them better, fewer layers, less structure, less process, fewer P&Ls, lower cost. I've stood up for a long time in terms of GE and asked people to do more with less. Now I'm asking them to do less, but do it better, Lean management, everything on the clock. So we've done Lean for 20 years in GE. We've added to that some process from Silicon Valley called the Lean Startup. We call it FastWorks. The H turbine has been launched in 2.5 years. The precursor to the H took 5 years, so real cycle time coming out in a real way.\r\nCommercial intensity, putting all the enabling functions, so they have to focus on the market, getting everybody engaged with what are the public customer metrics that we look at inside the company. And then the last element is really getting GE up to its digital entitlement. The fact is we can be leaner and faster if we just have the right IT tools as you think about the company and go forward.\r\nSo the Phase 1 of that was a lower-cost company, so getting down from 18% SG&A as a percentage of revenue down to 12%. We're well on our way. A faster, smarter company, this is FastWorks. This is gross margins and GE beliefs, right: Customer determines our success; stay lean to go fast; learn, improve, empower and inspire our people; and deliver results in an uncertain world. Those are good words for all of you in this room because that's the world we live in. That's where we live in today. So those are the things that are part of strategic execution inside the company.\r\nAnd then we've kind of solidified that with compensation. So the team is really on a very directed, financially clear plan where each business has financial goals that are kind of like we've done a long-term incentive plan for years. So these are 4 financial goals that really set the pool. The company kind of goal set the pool. Then, the businesses have to deliver on their 4 goals and then strategy as part of that in terms of deciding how much everybody gets paid. And for myself and the named executives, we now are all on some form of performance shares. So we're all kind of put our money totally aligned with investors. And then, again, going back to the Aviation example, 50% of our ROIC is very linear, financial. 50% is strategic. Do they get the LEAP out on time? Do they hit the right costs on the LEAP, things like that? And then that's filtered with the total company performance. So accountability, alignment, culture, all kind of part of the process of where the company is and the kinds of things we're doing, we think particularly good in the times we're in today.\r\nAnd so what does that mean overall? So I think in '15 -- like I said in '14, we'll see organic growth at the high end of the range, the 4% to 7% range. '15, we're talking about 2% to 5%. I'll go through Oil & Gas in a second, but we're really planning the company for a sluggish Oil & Gas sector in 2015. So we're at 15.7% margin in 2013, growth in '14, growth in '15, growth in '16. We have good momentum around margins and on track to hit our 17% ROIC goal by 2016. So organic growth, we've got a lot of good programs underway. Margins really underwriting any potential challenges in mix with better gross margin outperformance. In ROIC, a real focus on margin enhancement and capital efficiency going forward on returns. So in the end, our initiatives are all tied to better financial performance for the company and for the company going forward. So that's kind of the strategic overview of the company. \r\nNow kind of talking about 2015, so we're going to kind of change the way we communicate about the company in public. We know how endearing the pluses and pluses have become to everybody, but we thought, at least at the top of the house, we'd make it clearer and help people navigate through. So we're going to basically do 4 top line metrics.\r\nOne is Industrial EPS, and the Industrial EPS is a function of segments, corporate all the way down an Industrial EPS. And here, we're saying industrial EPS is in the range of $1.10 to $1.20. Industrial EPS will be up double digits, segment organic growth of 2% to 5%, margin expansion as part of that. Corporate will be somewhere between $2.3 billion and $2.5 billion, and we're basically saying, because they're so meaningful, Alstom and Appliances kind of close on July 1. So basically, we're kind of modeling the year as if M&A kind of all happens more or less at the same time. I think that's probably the smartest we are and the best way to kind of build the models.\r\nAt GE Capital, we're talking about $0.60 in 2015, smaller if we get a chance to make it smaller in an investor-friendly way, but we think this is a good base plan for people to think about. This basically assumes Synchrony happens on January 1, 2016. Again, just for planning purposes, this is the right way to think about it. If we have a chance to do it sooner, that's what we'll do.\r\nA number of free cash flow kind of plus dispositions, so kind of total cash generated, so this is CFOA minus P&E plus divestitures. So we're talking about CFOA of $14 billion to $16 billion, P&E between $4 billion and $4.5 billion and dispositions of $2 billion to $4 billion of cash received. So in other words, a lot of this has already been announced, so it's just getting cash in the door for that. And then cash returned to investors, a wide range here at $10 billion all the way to $30 billion, and that just includes dividend and the impact of buyback and Synchrony as you go through that. So these are the way to think about the company, the guideposts of the company, and now I'm going to take you kind of segment by segment in terms of how to think about where we are.\r\nSo we're going to leave the pluses just for the segments, but -- and I'm going to go through each segment individually. So I'm just going to -- this is really a summary page. But I just thought I'd spend a little bit of time on the high -- how to think about the high end and the low end of the range. \r\nSo I think the high end says the U.S. is better, that Healthcare in the U.S. continues to improve. I mean, it's -- third quarter was a little bit better. Fourth quarter, we think it's going to be okay. The business is taking a ton of cost out, so any incremental volume is pretty lucrative from a financial standpoint.\r\nAviation, Transportation, the history has been that as our customers earn more money, we earn more money. So if revenue passenger miles and spares and things like that stay where they are today, there's room for upside in some of these businesses.\r\nDecent Distributed Power and Wind business, these are very policy-driven businesses. So if you think about Distributed Power in countries that need electricity, when you think about wind, these tend to be more on the policy side, but see how that falls. Better cross execution, our sourcing should be better as we go into 2015, given the price of oil; that's a positive benefit of the price of oil. And then Alstom upside, again, we have a model, but these deals all happen in a different way once you close them.\r\nAnd then the low end of the range, it says, hey, what if instead of 3% plus global GDP growth that the IMF and everybody else forecast, what if it's actually lower than that because of other things that are happening in the world? We don't see that today, but we can accommodate some of that. We can accommodate Oil & Gas being worse and still be in the range. So we can accommodate more pressure there and still be in that earnings range.\r\nAnd we have a union contract here in 2015, so that always adds a little bit of variability. I always think about that in the context of what could happen.\r\nA public policy, hell, I have no idea if we're going to get tax reform or any of that stuff, so we don't know where that goes. And what if the dollar goes below $1.20? We've got to stress the plan to see what happens if really currency breaks out.\r\nBut the point I'd make for you is we've given you a pretty -- we've given you a range that can accommodate things getting worse and still be within that range. And that's probably the most important thing to think about at a moment like this. And if things are better, that's great for everybody, and that's how to think about it.\r\nSo Power & Water, when I'm going to show the businesses that have M&A, I'm going to show them with and without M&A. So if Alstom closes July 1, Steve and his team will have double-digit revenue and double-digit profit growth. If it doesn't close, just the core business has single-digit revenue and single-digit profit growth in Power & Water. We're not really assuming market growth per se. This is really a function of having really great products, so we have really good products versus our competition. We've got very good service execution on track. We have taken $1 billion of structural cost out of this business, so we've got a lean cost structure, and the team has been executing reasonably well. And what we try to do is hedge in here. You just get blue birds one way or the other, right. So in the Distributed Power side, this is really -- there's probably 5 or 10 deals we're working on at any given time that are just about emergency power and we try not to lean too heavily into those as being things to count on. And then you get the 6 months of Alstom in the -- Steve has responsibility for the power side. So that's kind of the base plan, so that's Power & Water.\r\nAviation, we basically talk about revenue up single digits and kind of profit growth ahead of that slightly and talk about a business that's really done extremely well over the last couple of years, extremely well positioned in the marketplace, winning in the OEM side, a good service franchise, a very strong service franchise. The negative mix is kind of in the run rate, so you kind of think about launching these engines. The first year stinks, but you already have that. So the GEnx kind of -- the GEnx cost comes down. Then, you introduce LEAP a couple of years from now, but basically, the badness you're going to feel from a product mix is already there. And investing to launch these new products, so still investing to launch new products. And military is going to continue to be tough. We don't see any good news vis-à-vis the military business, so that's going to be a drag on Aviation as it goes forward.\r\nOil & Gas. Oil & Gas, again, it is a flurry that's going around run this industry right now clearly. What I thought I'd do is just decompose the revenue on the cost side. So we basically have 5 segments. So the top line is we're counting on revenue being down slightly, and we're going to try to hold margins. That's kind of the base plan. So revenue's down, but we're taking a ton of cost actions, so that's kind of a -- we think, a reasonable plan.\r\nSo revenue, 5 segments. I start with Drilling & Surface. That's the most volatile piece of the mix. That's the first one that gets hit. We're counting on that being down more than 10% in revenue, so we've taken a fairly stark view on the Drilling & Surface business. \r\nAnd then you go to Subsea. Subsea is primarily oil, tough projects. Those projects are likely going to continue. In other words, people don't stop projects that are like this. So this is more than 70% backlog. We think orders are going to get hit in this business, but we see revenue playing through in '15 in all likelihood.\r\nAnd then Turbomachinery. Really, the LNG mix as a percentage of the global fuel is going to continue to grow. And as LNG fuel as a percentage of mix continues to grow, the completion of LNG projects goes forward, and so we see decent backlog in the Turbomachinery business. We see decent orders in the Turbomachinery business, and we've kind of modeled that to be okay next year. \r\nThe Measurement & Controls business, you have other people in your space like Honeywell and Emerson that are in that business. Some of that is MRO. A lot of it goes into the industries other than just oil and gas, so we kind of view that as being okay next year. And then the downstream is actually going to be better. So downstream projects are actually favored in the world we're in today. So we kind of see 60% of the portfolio revenue being okay. We see 15% where the revenue will continue, but orders are going to be very tough to come by. And we see 25% where revenue's going to be hard hit as you look at where it goes. So it's a diversified business. That's kind of how we do our planning for next year. I know on the cost side, we've been aggressive on both direct and base costs in the business, so we're well positioned for that. \r\nReally, one of the things that doesn't get written about a lot is the fact that even -- if you go back to the summer or before, there had been a lot of project inflation. A lot of our customers weren't that happy already with the projects and how they're being executed. So everybody in the industry was going through a cleanup process. And so we're already going through, even before Thanksgiving or OPEC or whatever you want to -- whatever you call [indiscernible] day, we were already doing a ton of restructuring, getting our costs out. Lorenzo already runs the business, and I would say, in a good way, as if oil prices were $60 or $70 a barrel. We look at projects -- when you talk to customers even before this, that's where they were. So we just want to continue that, and then we're just ready for the industry in times like this. So you've got to worry about pricing pressure. You've got to worry about a lot of stuff. \r\nSo we're not -- I think we've hedged this the right way. We've allowed room in the range in case things get worse, but we've been through these cycles before, SARS or power bubble or -- unfortunately, I've been doing this long enough. I could almost sing a song about all the crises I've seen. So I just put them all in a -- I just think we're just ready for this. And people ask me sometimes about -- I don't think this is the right time to do M&A. I like the space, guys. Let's be clear. I think over the long term, I like the space, just like I liked Aviation when it was tough, just like I liked all of our -- I like the -- we like this space. We like -- we think this is a good GE business. \r\nBut you don't have to buy things now. Really, I would say commercially, if you're in a -- this kind of turbulence, GE looks really good on almost every project we would ever work on versus anybody else, and so we just are going to -- we're going to position ourselves. We're going to run the place good for investors -- well for investors, and we like how this whole thing -- we like this business. We'd like it more at $120 per barrel. Don't get me wrong, but we like this business over the long term. \r\nHealthcare. We are prepared for more sluggishness. Again, I'd say Europe is still reasonably tough. The U.S. is a little bit better than where we've been. Japan has been extremely tough this year. Japan has been a very tough market in 2014. \r\nWe still see good growth in Life Sciences. That's more driven by drug discovery. We've taken a ton of costs out of this place, so we're well leveraged. Better products, what I talked about in the past. I think a better IT business. We basically missed the EMR wave in Healthcare, but we're pretty well positioned for the next wave in Healthcare in terms of applications that go with EMR. So we're pretty well positioned there. Still some uncertainty about what the Affordable Care Act is going to mean, but I would say we see people more willing to invest now than they were probably a year or 2 ago in terms of hospital CEOs, and so you're just going to have to be productive. So in Healthcare, we're counting on revenue growth, margin growth and slight profit growth in 2015. And if markets get better, we'll do better.\r\nI remind you in Transportation, as part of the Alstom deal, we're selling our signaling business to Alstom. So that's part of the transaction. That's why you see 2 comments here. So this year, a boomer in orders but more sluggish on revenue and margins, mainly because of the wheels business to Komatsu and to the mining space, so that's been a very tough year. We're not counting on the mining business getting any better. It's been a sluggish year, and we're kind of counting on a flat year, but we've got an incredible backlog now of locomotive. So this is going to have double-digit revenue growth, big backlog on orders. \r\nThe signaling business is pretty profitable, so that has an impact on margin rate, but -- so net-net, we'd have growing margins and growing revenue double digits. When you back out the signaling piece, you got operating profit growing positively and very strong backlog. So again, very well positioned. Technically, we've got the only Tier 4 locomotive, well positioned strategically in terms of where we are around the world, a good service franchise, a growing service franchise. \r\nMining, I think we have in a run rate now that's continuing to be soft. And what I worry about in a time like this and a business like this is we've got to take a brand new product. We've got to produce a bunch of them. We've got to take it down the learning curve, so this is not a market challenge. This is more of an execution challenge that I worry about in this business when I think about 2015.\r\nEnergy Management is really 3 businesses, and we're going to get -- again, Alstom has a big participation here. So without business development, you'd have single-digit revenue growth and a double-digit operating profit growth. With Alstom, you're going to have strong revenue growth and strong op profit growth. We've done a bunch of restructuring in this business, and we should have a decent year in Energy Management. \r\nI'll break it down into 3 pieces. Power Conversion is an essential technology for the company. Electrification is an essential technology, but we have had to put a ton of money into fixing this franchise. So we have really had to reinvest into this space, quite honestly, more than we thought we were going to have to, but we are really well poised to see a couple of good years of earnings growth in the Power Conversion business. It reminds me a little bit of the wind business back a decade ago. The wind business, for the first couple of years we owned it, we had to reinvest back in the product line. We had to clean up the installed base. It was terrible for probably 3 years, and then it just has generated a boatload of cash since then. I look at Power Conversion kind of the same way. \r\nDigital Energy is all about Alstom. Digital Energy is all about -- they're #3. We're #6. Together, we're a stronger #3. You've got ABB and Siemens, #1 and #2. ABB, in particular, earns mid-teens margins. Together, we're going to earn like 6 -- maybe 6% margins. There is a huge amount of margin runway when you think about those businesses and where you can go. \r\nAnd then Industrial Solutions, we've done a lot of restructuring. We're going to get good earnings growth. We'll probably -- I'd say in a year or 2, we'll be at or above 10% operating profit rate in the industrial systems business, and I think this is a business that's always got optionality. It's a better fit with Alstom, but it's a business that we always think about from an investor-friendly standpoint in terms of where we go. Our job in the short term is to make it better -- to make it much better.\r\nAppliances goes, so really, from a Lighting standpoint, it's just an LED story. We'll cross $1 billion on LEDs. This is really a -- more of an infrastructure service business today. It's a vastly different business, and then we've got to clean up. One way, shape or form, we've just got to clean up the old installed base around Lighting, but that's kind of where it is. Appliances, I think, we'll get a gain that, let's say, $0.07 -- $0.06, $0.07 a share of a gain that we're going to apply back to restructuring and other stuff around the company. So that's really Appliances & Lighting.\r\nCorporate, which has been -- kind of just a lot going on in Corporate. I think it's just going to be easier and simpler to understand, so we're going to continue to take costs, just pure run rate costs, out of Corporate. We expect gains to offset restructuring. So this year, we did 1 billion -- just a $0.10 plus of naked restructuring, right. So that's been a hurt to the company. That just goes away. So gains are going to offset restructuring next year, variability based on when you do it. The places where we're reinvesting are going to be places like the software COE is going to be the biggest place that we reinvest at Corporate. \r\nA ton going on in pension. We try to spell it out for you here in terms of what happens both in terms of interest rates and mortality tables and things like that. I would encourage you, if you're really curious about that stuff to talk to Jeff during the cocktail hour. My Ph.D. was in something other than mortality tables, but -- and then I think just simpler. Look, I just think as we're going through the big restructuring program, this has been a hard thing to track through. I think next year, we're really saying $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion, very transparent, part of the industrial EPS and kind of how we think about the company going forward.\r\nCapital allocation. Again, we talk about capital allocation in terms of '15 and '16. Again, given the -- just the Synchrony dynamic, I think, makes this a better way to look at it. So a real focus on free cash flow, our CFOA less P&E driving good improvement inside the businesses in terms of where we go on CFOA. Synchrony is going to allow for a great tax capital-efficient transaction for investors. Capital dividend, we're assuming that, that continues. And we're saying, in addition to the things that have already been announced, so like Appliances and things like that, always around the edges, there's at least, let's say, $2 billion of divestitures every year that we just view as just optionality, cleanup, things like that, and we would expect to have that in 2015 as well. \r\nAnd then from an allocation standpoint, $40 billion returned to investors in terms of the Synchrony split and dividends. Alstom is really the priority here, guys. I really -- this is our M&A plan, I would say, into '15 and '16, other than things that are around the edges. We want to do a good job on Alstom, and then we still invest a lot organically in terms of the company and the business and where it's going. So that's the financial plan. So we're saying $1.10 to $1.20 industrial EPS. That's up double digits versus this year. $0.60 on capital, could be smaller if we get an opportunity to do so in an investor-friendly way and then giving you a target for total cash generated, $12 billion to $15 billion free cash flow and cash given back to investors of $10 billion to $30 billion, depending on Synchrony and where we go.\r\nSo again, just to recap on the company. Look, we have an awesome infrastructure company that is focused on returns. It is competitively well positioned. It is going to be earning a substantial amount and increasing it over the years. And in GE Capital, that's really based on returns and competitive advantage, are going to dictate the size of GE Capital over time. So very -- I think a very strong portfolio in the world we live in today. \r\nAnd then just continuing to improve what I would say the horizontal capability inside the company, and that is product, but not just product innovation, but better manufacturing costs around the products. It is a fantastic global and growth market footprint. It is this merger of physical and digital -- really, owning the analytical space and doing a better job of taking costs out of our company. It is having a very strong service franchise, which we think in slow growth and volatile times is a good underpinning for the company, and we've made great strides to make the service business even better. Intense focus on gross margins and return on invested capital and momentum already in place to achieve that and a focus on accountability and simplification.\r\nAnd then not to go crazy on forward guidance, clearly, but there's so much going on in the portfolio, I just want to give you a -- how I would think about the company going forward into '16. So you're going to lose Synchrony earnings. Capital's going to be, let's say, $0.40 a share, plus or minus, right. That's where it's going to be. Then you take an industrial business, you basically -- you got restructuring equal gains, that adds. You got a buyback, that adds. You got Alstom, that adds. And then you got -- let's say you just target 5% to 10% organic growth. You've got industrial earnings that more than offset capital going down, so we're growing EPS this year. We're going to grow EPS next year. We're going to grow EPS in '16, and we're going to do it while massively changing the portfolio in the world where we see today and kind of underwriting some negative risk, and that's how we think about the company in '15 and '16 going forward. \r\nSo last thing I'd just say it's a different company. We've got to run it -- we've got to think about it in a different context. I've got to think about it in a different context. I would say massively portfolio ins and outs, those days of big changes, I'm not saying we won't ever change anything, shift to getting the most out of the portfolio we have, improving returns. Improving returns industrially, we think we can get to 17% and improving returns in GE Capital. We've got to get GE Capital above 10%, and so this is a team that's going to get measured, managed, compensated based on generating good returns out of the portfolio we have, point number one.\r\nPoint number two, if you look at the blended talent at the top, there's nobody in headquarters that hasn't come recently from a business. We just basically have more intense operating focus at every point in the place, and I think that's a good thing. I'm not sure I would ever again have people in the corporate top of the house that hadn't been in a business in a substantial way. I just think you get a different sensibility when you do that, and it's particularly important since I've been in the job for a while that you get new agitation that comes into that. \r\nI'd say point number three, I read all the notes you guys write about all of our competitors. I read almost everywhere. I don't read everywhere, but I read almost everywhere. And yes, Scott, especially with you. But any time you stop investing, you die in this business, right. But I think we had the flaw or I had the flaw sometimes of investing in too many things. I think what has to happen now is you've got to be investing in -- more in -- if you launch new products, you got to get the costs out. Analytics are going to improve the productivity and margins of all of our service portfolio. Globally, when we go to a country, we go there not just to sell. We go there to drive productivity at the same time, so I really see a dramatic change in the way we invest about the share and margins. But any time you stop investing, if you decide to sit out the next round of narrow bodies, you lose for 30 years. If you decide to sit out the next round of large flat gas turbines, you lose for 30 years. So investment is part of what we do in these companies, but the investment has to be narrower and deeper, and I think that's important. \r\nModernizing the capability, you want us to be better at analytics and IT. You want us to be better at analytics and IT. I'm just telling you that flat out, that's got to be a core competency in where we go. \r\nAnd monetizing the culture, leaner, faster, risk-based, competitive. It's just a different place. It's a better place. It's a different place. It's important for us to be positioned where we need to get to in the future. \r\nSo with that, let me stop there and take questions. Scott, let's start with you. Do we have mics?",
      "transcript_text3": "There's a lot of skepticism around Oil & Gas. For one thing, it's a bit of a falling knife still. We haven't hit a bottom yet. But what is the comfort level that you have that the backlog that you're talking about that you think is stable doesn't have to get repriced? Because there are some of the -- your customers out there have already come out publicly and said, \"We want some pain share here, and we may ask our suppliers to share some of the pain.\"\n\n---\n\nSo I think, Scott, in the stress -- in the base case you see today, some of that's already in it. So in other words, we're not just taking a static backlog and rolling it through. We're assuming there's going to -- you saw on my chart room for price pressure. So we've kind of thought somewhat about that, but I would say one of the mitigants to that is we were already working that way. These projects that had been going on were 50% to 100% inflation versus the way that they were priced before. So we were already working it that way, and I think we've -- in our base case, we've mitigated. We've kind of counted on some of that to take place.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And as a follow-up, the comment on Alstom margins -- service margins being 10 points below yours, help us understand how easy it is to get those margins up. And what happens to the overall enterprise? Does -- do your margins go up as it -- because of the scale -- of increased scale that gets put through your service centers? Do the overall complex margins go up? And just help us understand the level of difficulty [indiscernible].\n\n---\n\nSo what I would say, Scott, I would think about this in 2 stages. So I think, in many ways, whatever commercial agreements that they had will be honored out of the box, right. But you basically have specific and direct overlap of capabilities. So when you look at SG&A, it's almost one-for-one overlap. So that's, let's say, the first tranche of margins. The second tranche is the -- there's just no analytics, remote monitoring, things like that, that take place in a lot of the projects that they have. And then I would think about Steve's business in aggregate that the blended average, initially, the margin goes down because we're not going to be able to offset the entirety of that mix. But over time, we build back up, so that the GE margins you see today over the next couple of years are going to be the blended margin, and that's built into the return case that we see over time. Steve?\n\n---\n\nJeff, one additional question around oil pricing is a lot of your gas turbine growth and Alstom's growth in recent years has come from oil-rich nations. What gives you the confidence that, in bulk, you're not going to face pressure on the gas turbine front as these nations find their own difficulty if these oil prices are sustained?\n\n---\n\nSteve, again, we underwrite -- the case you've seen in the Power & Water segment is kind of flat market, so we're not really counting on much growth. A lot of the incremental backlog now is kind of U.S. -- U.S. is kicking in more, Mexico kicking in more, China looks pretty good, things like that. And then you basically underwrite it country by country. So you underwrite it. What do you think about Saudi? I still am pretty -- Saudi needs electricity. They're going to buy electricity. I would say when we first sat down to do the operating plan for 2015 in Power & Water, we had another big slug of turbines for Iraq. Those are gone. So we basically go -- Nigeria, we're not counting on much for Nigeria. We're not counting on much for Iraq. We'll complete the Algerian order. We still think countries like Saudi are going to be okay as you go through that. You're going to see -- again, between now and the end of the year, you're going to see big -- maybe one big order, maybe more that take place in the regions like the ones you're worried about. So there's still a big hunt for emergency power and electricity. Look, electricity matters to these places. It's the last thing to be de-invested. So I would say what we've done is underwritten our case country by country. Some of the themes that we would have had 6 months ago are gone, and some have stayed. Saudi have stayed.\n\n---\n\nAnd in terms of the holding margins in Oil & Gas, and you talk about having gotten ahead of the cost reductions now, maybe give us a little more color for what you've actually been doing there that gives us -- should give us confidence that -- we're already in, right, December. Has this already been a part of the restructuring that you've been doing? Where are you? And how should we feel comfortable that you're going to be able to match that [indiscernible]?\n\n---\n\nSo go back in time. So what was the thing most people would be talking about in the oil and gas industry, let's say, a year ago? It was oversold. We're sitting on 6 or 9 months of late backlog. The supply chain, if you compare the oil and gas, just -- not just GE but the whole industry. If you compare the Oil & Gas supply chain to the Aviation supply chain, it's not even close, the reliably of the suppliers, the productivity of the suppliers, the reliability of the projects, the delivery of the projects. So I would say, Steve, we've been working like mad just to clean up our own factories, suppliers, getting things on time. So we've done more than $4 billion of restructuring over the last 3 or 4 years. Some of that's been in Oil & Gas, and I would say we're going to have very aggressive base cost programs. But we also have very aggressive variable cost programs that go along with that. So it's not just the base cost set. This is a supply chain capability as well. So I think that's the way I would think about it. This was not a super-efficient industry before. There is a ton of room just to get the Oil & Gas business up to the standards of the rest of the GE -- internal GE family. Well, with that, guys, I'm just going to reiterate we -- there's things we still don't know about Oil & Gas, and we've tried to create a range that underwrites more things that we don't know. We do the best we can for where we sit here today, but we try to keep a big enough range that the downside can allow for Oil & Gas to get worse. Yes, Steve?\n\n---\n\nThere's a lot of moving parts in Corporate with the gains and restructuring. Can you maybe just clarify? Is Alstom restructuring going to be taken in the second half of '15? Just, I guess, the puts and takes around gains and restructuring in total.\n\n---\n\nSo Steve, I'll do the best I can and then maybe you can hit, Jeff. I would say the gains will be in excess of $1 billion. Then those will be eaten up by -- some of it by Alstom restructuring, things associated with that and then just pure restructuring. So we'll still do pure restructuring as part of that as well, but we view kind of the closing cost, the Alstom restructuring will be in Corporate.\n\n---\n\nAnd then I thought you said for the '16 slide, you said some of that organic growth of 5% to 10%. Was that revenue growth? Or was that profit?\n\n---\n\nI -- No, I didn't -- we didn't give a guidance on '16 revenue. Our long-term target is 5%, but I'm just trying to get people to think through what just happens -- we're not really thinking -- restructuring equal gains, buyback, Alstom, those 3 things are kind of -- we don't have to go out and do anything new. Those happen, and then you're going to get organic growth that happens alongside of that when you think about '16. It's too soon to...\n\n---\n\nAnd then what is your oil price assumption for, at least, this year and...\n\n---\n\nWe do 60 to 65. That's kind of where we are, but I -- again, like I said, I don't think we know. But that's how we did our plans in that range.\n\n---\n\nAnd then one just last one. Your free cash flow, excluding dispositions, it's about, I think, $10 billion to $11.5 billion for next year.\n\n---\n\nI think it was $14 billion to $16 billion, less $4 billion to $5 billion. I said -- I think it's -- yes, so you're right, I think.\n\n---\n\nYes. So you're paying out a $9 billion dividend. I assume some of that cash is overseas. I mean, are you -- how are you managing this from a liquidity perspective? Are you bringing back cash and paying the tax in an efficient way or...\n\n---\n\nWell, you're going to get the chance to do Alstom out of foreign cash. You got -- we've got lots of optionality about how we think about -- we leave the year with $16 billion or more of cash. So you've got a ton of optionality around cash right now. Really, the big deals are Alstom for next year. Deane?\n\n---\n\nJeff, interested in hearing some more thoughts on what you consider to be the optimal mix for GE because we heard a couple messages today, a big plus sign in front of that 75% and lots of arrows down on making GE Capital smaller. And Slide 9, it was pretty clear you're going to seek every opportunity to make GE Capital smaller. So what are the -- I assume you -- if you get an investor-friendly way. But what are the parameters on the GE Capital fit today? Is it risk? Is it the cash flow opportunities? You manage the SIFI requirements well, but still you want to get smaller. So just where is the optimal mix? And what are the parameters?\n\n---\n\nSo again, Deane, what I would say is that the output on split is more the output than the input. So when I think about the strategy of the company, it's investing in really great businesses that leverage our core capability, improve the returns, things like that, right. But when I look at GE Capital, to me, it's about competitive advantage and returns and which businesses do we have the most competitive advantage in and can we generate an attractive return for our investors, given the requirements and getting the CCAR in '17 and things like that. And then the third thing is, I just -- we have to make it under our control. I think one of the good things we've done since the financial crisis is we've only talked about things that are in our own control, like doing the Synchrony spin and things like that. So I think when you factor in all those things, it's likely going to be small. We kind of say post-Synchrony, it's going to be less than $300 billion, and I think if you look at competitive advantage, returns, doing under our control, it's likely going to be smaller than that. We're on track to be part of the CCAR process in 2017. That's meaningful. That creates optionality in that time -- maybe more in that time period. So that's how I think about it, Deane, really. We're not in it just to -- we're not in it just to be in it. We're in it to generate a good return. Jeffrey?\n\n---\n\nJust pass this mic down one at a time. I was here first. Part of the portfolio change, in a sense, at least it looks like it de-risks the portfolio as capital gets smaller, but I'm thinking kind of the flipside of that. You mentioned projects a couple of times in Oil & Gas. Obviously, with Alstom, you're moving in to balance the plant and grid work and things that have kind of been the bane of the existence of some players over the years. How do you actually manage through that? You're hiring people from Bechtel, so there's a little bit of acknowledgment that you do need some help there. And is it having any impact on your cash conversion? It looks like your cash conversion's under a little bit of pressure.\n\n---\n\nSo what I would say, Jeff, is the project stuff isn't something that we've actively seek-ed to increase or decrease. With the acquisition of Alstom, we have it. So we're learning about it. We're going to kind of assess our ability to run it and run it well as time goes on. We're in the integration process, so we'll learn a lot about it. But it's not -- it's neither a strategic imperative nor is it something we run away from. It just is a function of where we are. And from a cash conversion standpoint, I think any time progress and things like that go up and down as orders go up and down. But our businesses like Power & Water, Aviation, these were all 20%-plus return on capital businesses. So they still are good cash-generating, over-the-top businesses.\n\n---\n\nAnd just one other final thing, just on Alstom. So the -- will the restructuring actually be up in kind of the Corporate or segments? I would have thought a lot of that would have happened in purchase accounting and maybe...\n\n---\n\nYes, it's going to be there as well, Jeff. So I think a lot of it's going to be purchase accounting. But in terms of -- there's always some changes that go to -- when we've done acquisitions in the past, there's been charges that have gone to Corporate, and that's where those will be. The caveat, the corollary of that says in Power & Water, you're going to see the Power & Water segment's going to be several hundred million dollars greater. They'll have Alstom coming in, in the second half. So that's where the upside is there, yes.\n\n---\n\nJeff, can you just maybe talk about how 4Q orders have tracked? And I guess, specifically, have you've seen any change in behavior from customers? Either sort of the lower oil price or strong dollar, any change in behavior at all?\n\n---\n\nSo Nigel, I'd say -- again, guys, I'm giving you the best I see today, right. So I would say slight positive orders to be for the fourth quarter would be my hunch based on where we're tracking here today, and I think other than Oil & Gas, Aviation commercial spares, average daily order rate is the highest since -- certainly, since I've been CEO. We'll take more locomotive orders in the second half of the year than any time in our -- really, in our history. So I don't see it yet, but I'm -- China will have positive orders in the quarter, right. So I think it's always good to take pause at a time like this and be thoughtful about what's happening and things like that. So I don't want to be Nostradamus or anything like that. I just am telling you kind of what we see, and that's what we see. Clearly, Oil & Gas customers are going to do a double clutch, right, as I said, go through what they're -- some projects will go forward. Some projects won't. But on balance, we're kind of counting for -- we track what they say about CapEx and then kind of plan for things to be at least that bad, if not worse.\n\n---\n\nAnd then, secondly, your friends in Bavaria have seen a very different power market in '15 than you do, price down heavily, margins down heavily. Can you just provide some perspective on the power market generally in '15, GE versus your competitors?\n\n---\n\nI think the markets -- it's a competitive market, and it's a flat market. So I think that's what most of the kind of industry analysts talk about. That's kind of how we plan it. There's going to be a ton of H activity. There's going to be ton of large block activity. And then, Nigel, it just depends on where the -- there's -- a lot of the action is going to be in Japan next year. So you're going to see Japan's going to be a super big market. The U.S. is going to be a bigger market next year. So a lot of the pricing ends up being as much about the regional mix as it does about any given transaction, I think, in terms of where we go. But we're certainly not counting on the market to be superhot. Yes?\n\n---\n\nJust a question on oil, is low oil good for GE or bad for GE?\n\n---\n\nSo as you can imagine, we think a lot about that, particularly in the last months or so. I'd say, on balance, it's probably closer to watch. It's probably close to watch for a slight negative, but it's not a big negative is the way I would think about it. I'd say when our customers make more money, they spend more. But it's going to have an impact on our Oil & Gas business.\n\n---\n\nAnd just following up from Steve's question about cash flow, if you look what you're generating versus you're spending on dividends and CapEx, there's sort of not much left to play with. So do we need to wait until CCAR to get more optionality? Can you actually -- are you in a position to actually use the Industrial balance sheet beyond '16 if needed? Or is that also part of the CCAR process?\n\n---\n\nLook, I still think we have debt capacity on the Industrial balance sheet. We're not counting on it. And look, if you just look at our metrics, there's more cash in GE Capital than just the pure income dividend. But we're a part of a regulatory process, and we're going to have to think about that. But, guys, look, we've got a fantastic set of Industrial businesses, and we've got all the juice we need to continue to grow the Industrial franchise. So I feel pretty good about where we are in total, but there's not a day that I don't walk past Keith and say, \"How about one for the Gipper?\" It's -- okay - just. Hey, Joe?\n\n---\n\nJeff, so your Industrial gross margins the last few years have been on a bit of a decline, and some of that is due to we've had this massive equipment cycle. But look, you look at your service, backlog is up strongly. Some of your simplification efforts are coming through. You're starting to incentivize gross margin expansion. At what point do you start to see gross margins turn up?\n\n---\n\nI think we've already told you that we expect to see them up next year.\n\n---\n\nAnd is there a specific target then beyond next year?\n\n---\n\n50 basis points. I think we've said 50 a year for the next couple of years. We've kind of targeted everything through '16, so we're kind of saying 50 a year in '15 and '16. And so what we've done is we've underwritten that, I think, including as much mix as we can see. Mix has certainly hurt us, but it's not a good excuse. I think we can do a better job on gross margins.\n\n---\n\nAnd the follow-up is on the $135 billion in noncore assets that you're looking at potentially aggressively divesting. Can you talk a little bit about the timing? How are you thinking about potentially the use of those proceeds once you eventually divest of those assets?\n\n---\n\nLook, I think the -- so we've talked a little bit about Australia consumer. You've seen the announcements on the Hungarian bank. We're going to keep aggressively going after all that consumer red assets, make those smaller. As we shrink, there ought to be more cash optionality in GE Capital. So we would expect that to be reflected over time in terms of how we go. And Synchrony should be a couple of billion dollar gain. It depends on where the stock is and where it closes and when we do it, and that will give us more optionality to continue to reduce red assets faster. Yes, let me go here. Yes, Julian?\n\n---\n\nJust a question on Healthcare because you could -- from the outside, you could look at it and say, \"All it is, is sort of relentless cost-cutting.\" And also you had that slide 7 on...\n\n---\n\nDifferent from every other business, huh?\n\n---\n\nRight. Well, you had Slide 7 on improving the portfolio that had this sort of equals sign against Healthcare. I wasn't really sure what that meant. You had a leadership change recently at the business. So just...\n\n---\n\nI think on the portfolio moves. So look, my view is that Amersham's going to generate its cost of capital. I'm glad we did it. Healthcare IT, we acquired IDX. We should have been at better position for the EMR wave. That's a pivot we should have done a better job at. These businesses pivot. These businesses -- think about the Power business, right. We went through the gas turbine bubble, but we've led in wind. We've led in distributed power. We've made every good pivot that the business has to make to be successful. So as these businesses, as Oil & Gas goes through a cycle, as Aviation goes through a cycle, as Power & Water has gone through maybe the biggest of all cycles, the team pivoted extremely well. And look, we were on the field with a pretty good franchise in Healthcare IT and just didn't execute as well as -- and that was the wave of growth, Julian, over the last 5 years. Now we're going to be able to catch the next wave, but that's what you should expect us to do. In terms of health care, look, the market has been -- we've gone through a massive consolidation. Customers have kind of sat on their wallet for a couple of years. Procedures have started to grow again. If you go back over time, procedure growth has always been a precursor for new capital equipment growth. My expectation is that the U.S. has a decent year. Europe is going to be very tough. China, instead of growing double digits, will probably grow high-single digits in health care. But I think all we're asking John to do is kind of low- to mid-single digit revenue growth, expand margins and be ready, be positioned.\n\n---\n\nAnd then just on Industrial overall, you used to give some color on the margin, sort of puts and takes, value gaps, simplification, R&D. How does that look for next year putting Alstom aside?\n\n---\n\nSo we've got another big year on -- we've got -- so we're expecting margin growth next year. So we expect to be 13%, let's say more or less; SG&A percentage of revenue next year. So we expect the SG&A to continue to come down, and we expect gross margins to be better. And that SG&A, Julian, will be a mixture of different stuff, but that's kind of the pathway we've shown you guys, and we expect to be on that pathway. Hey, John?\n\n---\n\nSo the past few years have been characterized by industrial companies focusing their operations, either through tax-free spins or whatnot, and one of the thematics of your pitch very much was big companies like GE have competitive advantages to play in these global arenas. None of us would have expected that deal the size of Alstom as you had been bolt-on centric, I realize that's key theme to you. So how are you now, just as a starting point, thinking about big acquisitions, both in that context and then being opportunistic, considering you've done the biggest deal ever?\n\n---\n\nLook, I just -- I like the way the company looks right now. I think, John, we basically have exited businesses that didn't use the GE Store. Appliances, we weren't in it to win, didn't use our core capability. Every business we have uses [indiscernible] to win. So [indiscernible] there. I like the company the way it looks today. The second thing I'd say is Alstom has a tremendous value-creating potential for our investors, but it's going to take all of our hard work to do it. We have plenty on our plate for next year to execute on, on Alstom, and I'm just -- we're just not that interested in doing another. Given we like what we have and we've got good value-creating work on our plate right now, that's enough for right now.\n\n---\n\nYes. No, in fact, I think you said that's M&A for '15, '16, right?\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nSo okay, here's my sort of, kind of the corollary question. This whole supply-driven dynamics we're in with respect to oil, I guess a lot of us believe that this starts in '15 but spills -- unless there's some sort of shift, this is going to spill into '16. So you guys have made a big energy footprint commitment for presumably forever. Why not retain the flexibility if market conditions provide to go after and actually get much bigger in energy in certain locations, right?\n\n---\n\nOkay, John, here's the -- I think it's a great question, but let me just tell you the way I think about it, which is I think in Oil & Gas -- we like Oil & Gas. I'll go back. We like Oil & Gas. We're diversified in Oil & Gas. We think this is a seminal business for the world. And we want to be in it, and we are in it. In this kind of volatility, GE is a very good person for any NOC or IOC to do business with, right. If you're an IOC and you want to test $65 a barrel on your new projects, you're going to come to GE to do that. So why would I pay anybody goodwill right now when basically our competitive position is better today, relatively speaking, than it was a month ago? I think that's the bottom line right now. There's just no reason to have to do that. Our relative competitive position in the businesses we're in has gotten better. These are cycles we know. We have fundamental strength that other people don't have. Look, we can all arm-wrestle over the value of a conglomerate, right. We can all arm-wrestle that one. This exactly the right time to want to be in a multi-business company, exactly the right time. Because our company is going to grow double-digit EPS next year even with a much worse oil case than the one we see today. Because Aviation is doing great, and Transportation is doing great, and we've got Alstom, and we've got a bunch of other stuff under way. Those are things that FMC doesn't have. Those are things that Schlum [ph] doesn't have. Those are things that none of these guys have. I like us in that field right now. Chris?\n\n---\n\nJeff, a lot of talk about gross margin today. Haven't really noticed it being part of your messaging in the past so much. So I'm just wondering what caused that to precipitate at such a big line today. And just if you could comment on observation that if you combine that with your SG&A targets, it would seem to put you through the 17% margin target.\n\n---\n\nSo look, I'd say we have had a tremendous amount of mix headwind, Chris. And I think before we talk publicly to you guys about stuff, it's typically stuff we've been working on for a year or 2. So we've kind of been percolating, I would say, the programs around gross margins, and it's the way you get to 17%. You got to have both things working, and we've got to allow a little bit of room for mix. It's just -- I think that's probably something we can do a better job of. So a, it's taken a while, we've got the programs in place; b, I always thought SG&A was a tremendous place to start just because the nature of the company had changed so vastly, right. Just the global footprint of GE is so different today than it was when I became CEO. Our cost was in the wrong place. Our processes were in the wrong place. So the simplification around SG&A was the best place to focus and, again, I think the combination of Dan and Jeff and Jamie and other people, we've got a good set of leaders to get it done.\n\n---\n\nOkay. So the 50 basis [indiscernible] is independent of it?\n\n---\n\nYes. So in other words, that includes mix, right.  Yes, yes. One or -- a couple more. Yes, how are you doing? Good.\n\n---\n\nJust building on some of the previous questions, if we think about just your embedded assumptions for '15 and '16, either quantitative or qualitatively around price across the board.\n\n---\n\nOn pricing of back -- on like pure price?\n\n---\n\nYes. So I think you have a 2% to 5% organic growth target for '15. But obviously, you've been talking about a lot of initiatives around gross margin and then, obviously, you have a deflationary environment for oil, which will also put some...\n\n---\n\nSo here's what I would say. I would say we had a positive value gap this year. Our expectation is that we have a positive value gap in '15, and I just think it's too soon to forecast around '16, right? So I think you've got a lot of positive momentum, a lot of things already in the backlog, and there's just nothing deflation -- or there's nothing inflationary in my world today fundamentally. So we're going to pricing pressure in Oil & Gas. We're going to have price -- maybe gas turbines pricing pressure, stuff like that. But there's nothing we really look at as incoming that's inflationary at all. So we would expect, in fact, to get incremental deflation with oil price as well.\n\n---\n\nSo negative prices for '15 -- early '15?\n\n---\n\nAgain, I think we look at a positive value gap, which would probably mean orders pricing will be flat to up slightly, and we'll get deflation, right. So you'll have a positive value gap. But how that plays out in '16, it's just too soon to think about it.\n\n---\n\nAnd just the last question in some -- just around the change in some of the incentives, both at the, I guess, segments and at the C-suite. Could you just comment, what do you think you've changed for the better? Or what have you tried to do to try to modernize it?\n\n---\n\nAgain, I think we always, as managers, maximize -- always want to maximize judgment in terms of how you -- so we've always done goals and objectives for the company. We flow those all the way down. They've always been numerically based forever, for 30 years I've been with GE. I think the change we've made is just much more formulaic. Really, it puts judgment aside and basically says, \"What do you want to see as an investor?\" And now you have 5,000 people that are going to get paid that way. So it's just complete pass-through from what you want in the company to what a executive band plant manager in Aviation, how they see their incentive comp, and it's always been directionally the same. Now it is linear, and I think that's -- in an uncertain world, that's certain. That's better. Maybe, Matt, you want to do one more?\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nWe'll do one more. Yes?\n\n---\n\nJust sort of 2 questions quickly. One is just going back to the lack of likelihood of doing M&A in the oil and gas space. Is part of that related to the obvious that Alstom cost you 2 to 3x more than you had expected to spend on acquisitions a couple of years ago? Is that part of it, that you feel like you...\n\n---\n\nIt's just -- I come back, guys, and say -- look, I mean, I don't think -- we've got every box covered that we want basically in the space and, fundamentally, I think our competitive position is better today than it was 6 months ago. So organically, we can generate a ton of value versus buying anything. So I never want to say never. I just don't view it as a strategic imperative for the company.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And just secondly, can you talk a little bit about how you're looking out over the next years, how you're thinking about buyback versus dividend? And I know you've joked around offline of you won't retire until you get the dividend back up to the higher watermark. Can you talk to us a little bit about that?\n\n---\n\nLook, the buyback -- I think Synchrony was a tremendous way to, in a capital-efficient way, buy back a ton of shares at the same time. And so look, we talked about that more than a year ago. It's now coming more into focus, so that's a very capital-efficient way to do it. I think the company's well positioned organically. We still invest a lot in organic growth. So we think that's important, and people like -- a vast majority of our investors still like seeing the dividend grow in line with earnings. So I would say dividend in line with earnings. Let's do a great job of integration on Alstom and then see where we are in M&A, and let's do -- use incremental capital beyond that for buybacks. But Synchrony, right now, is the key driver for the buyback, and that's -- between dividend and buyback, $40 billion over 2 years is pretty good, pretty good.\r\nSo let me end there. The team, the team is all here. So cocktails, you can -- Lorenzo, I'm sure, will be a popular guy at cocktail. So I'll let Lorenzo on his own. And thanks, and we'll see you -- we'll circulate. Great.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Scott Davis (Analysts)】\nThere's a lot of skepticism around Oil & Gas. For one thing, it's a bit of a falling knife still. We haven't hit a bottom yet. But what is the comfort level that you have that the backlog that you're talking about that you think is stable doesn't have to get repriced? Because there are some of the -- your customers out there have already come out publicly and said, \"We want some pain share here, and we may ask our suppliers to share some of the pain.\"\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jeffrey Immelt (Executives)】\nSo I think, Scott, in the stress -- in the base case you see today, some of that's already in it. So in other words, we're not just taking a static backlog and rolling it through. We're assuming there's going to -- you saw on my chart room for price pressure. So we've kind of thought somewhat about that, but I would say one of the mitigants to that is we were already working that way. These projects that had been going on were 50% to 100% inflation versus the way that they were priced before. So we were already working it that way, and I think we've -- in our base case, we've mitigated. We've kind of counted on some of that to take place.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Davis (Analysts)】\nOkay. And as a follow-up, the comment on Alstom margins -- service margins being 10 points below yours, help us understand how easy it is to get those margins up. And what happens to the overall enterprise? Does -- do your margins go up as it -- because of the scale -- of increased scale that gets put through your service centers? Do the overall complex margins go up? And just help us understand the level of difficulty [indiscernible].\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jeffrey Immelt (Executives)】\nSo what I would say, Scott, I would think about this in 2 stages. So I think, in many ways, whatever commercial agreements that they had will be honored out of the box, right. But you basically have specific and direct overlap of capabilities. So when you look at SG&A, it's almost one-for-one overlap. So that's, let's say, the first tranche of margins. The second tranche is the -- there's just no analytics, remote monitoring, things like that, that take place in a lot of the projects that they have. And then I would think about Steve's business in aggregate that the blended average, initially, the margin goes down because we're not going to be able to offset the entirety of that mix. But over time, we build back up, so that the GE margins you see today over the next couple of years are going to be the blended margin, and that's built into the return case that we see over time. Steve?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Attendee (Attendees)】\nJeff, one additional question around oil pricing is a lot of your gas turbine growth and Alstom's growth in recent years has come from oil-rich nations. What gives you the confidence that, in bulk, you're not going to face pressure on the gas turbine front as these nations find their own difficulty if these oil prices are sustained?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jeffrey Immelt (Executives)】\nSteve, again, we underwrite -- the case you've seen in the Power & Water segment is kind of flat market, so we're not really counting on much growth. A lot of the incremental backlog now is kind of U.S. -- U.S. is kicking in more, Mexico kicking in more, China looks pretty good, things like that. And then you basically underwrite it country by country. So you underwrite it. What do you think about Saudi? I still am pretty -- Saudi needs electricity. They're going to buy electricity. I would say when we first sat down to do the operating plan for 2015 in Power & Water, we had another big slug of turbines for Iraq. Those are gone. So we basically go -- Nigeria, we're not counting on much for Nigeria. We're not counting on much for Iraq. We'll complete the Algerian order. We still think countries like Saudi are going to be okay as you go through that. You're going to see -- again, between now and the end of the year, you're going to see big -- maybe one big order, maybe more that take place in the regions like the ones you're worried about. So there's still a big hunt for emergency power and electricity. Look, electricity matters to these places. It's the last thing to be de-invested. So I would say what we've done is underwritten our case country by country. Some of the themes that we would have had 6 months ago are gone, and some have stayed. Saudi have stayed.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Attendee (Attendees)】\nAnd in terms of the holding margins in Oil & Gas, and you talk about having gotten ahead of the cost reductions now, maybe give us a little more color for what you've actually been doing there that gives us -- should give us confidence that -- we're already in, right, December. Has this already been a part of the restructuring that you've been doing? Where are you? And how should we feel comfortable that you're going to be able to match that [indiscernible]?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jeffrey Immelt (Executives)】\nSo go back in time. So what was the thing most people would be talking about in the oil and gas industry, let's say, a year ago? It was oversold. We're sitting on 6 or 9 months of late backlog. The supply chain, if you compare the oil and gas, just -- not just GE but the whole industry. If you compare the Oil & Gas supply chain to the Aviation supply chain, it's not even close, the reliably of the suppliers, the productivity of the suppliers, the reliability of the projects, the delivery of the projects. So I would say, Steve, we've been working like mad just to clean up our own factories, suppliers, getting things on time. So we've done more than $4 billion of restructuring over the last 3 or 4 years. Some of that's been in Oil & Gas, and I would say we're going to have very aggressive base cost programs. But we also have very aggressive variable cost programs that go along with that. So it's not just the base cost set. This is a supply chain capability as well. So I think that's the way I would think about it. This was not a super-efficient industry before. There is a ton of room just to get the Oil & Gas business up to the standards of the rest of the GE -- internal GE family. Well, with that, guys, I'm just going to reiterate we -- there's things we still don't know about Oil & Gas, and we've tried to create a range that underwrites more things that we don't know. We do the best we can for where we sit here today, but we try to keep a big enough range that the downside can allow for Oil & Gas to get worse. Yes, Steve?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Attendee (Attendees)】\nThere's a lot of moving parts in Corporate with the gains and restructuring. Can you maybe just clarify? Is Alstom restructuring going to be taken in the second half of '15? Just, I guess, the puts and takes around gains and restructuring in total.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jeffrey Immelt (Executives)】\nSo Steve, I'll do the best I can and then maybe you can hit, Jeff. I would say the gains will be in excess of $1 billion. Then those will be eaten up by -- some of it by Alstom restructuring, things associated with that and then just pure restructuring. So we'll still do pure restructuring as part of that as well, but we view kind of the closing cost, the Alstom restructuring will be in Corporate.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Attendee (Attendees)】\nAnd then I thought you said for the '16 slide, you said some of that organic growth of 5% to 10%. Was that revenue growth? Or was that profit?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jeffrey Immelt (Executives)】\nI -- No, I didn't -- we didn't give a guidance on '16 revenue. Our long-term target is 5%, but I'm just trying to get people to think through what just happens -- we're not really thinking -- restructuring equal gains, buyback, Alstom, those 3 things are kind of -- we don't have to go out and do anything new. Those happen, and then you're going to get organic growth that happens alongside of that when you think about '16. It's too soon to...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Attendee (Attendees)】\nAnd then what is your oil price assumption for, at least, this year and...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jeffrey Immelt (Executives)】\nWe do 60 to 65. That's kind of where we are, but I -- again, like I said, I don't think we know. But that's how we did our plans in that range.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Attendee (Attendees)】\nAnd then one just last one. Your free cash flow, excluding dispositions, it's about, I think, $10 billion to $11.5 billion for next year.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jeffrey Immelt (Executives)】\nI think it was $14 billion to $16 billion, less $4 billion to $5 billion. I said -- I think it's -- yes, so you're right, I think.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Attendee (Attendees)】\nYes. So you're paying out a $9 billion dividend. I assume some of that cash is overseas. I mean, are you -- how are you managing this from a liquidity perspective? Are you bringing back cash and paying the tax in an efficient way or...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jeffrey Immelt (Executives)】\nWell, you're going to get the chance to do Alstom out of foreign cash. You got -- we've got lots of optionality about how we think about -- we leave the year with $16 billion or more of cash. So you've got a ton of optionality around cash right now. Really, the big deals are Alstom for next year. Deane?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Deane Dray (Analysts)】\nJeff, interested in hearing some more thoughts on what you consider to be the optimal mix for GE because we heard a couple messages today, a big plus sign in front of that 75% and lots of arrows down on making GE Capital smaller. And Slide 9, it was pretty clear you're going to seek every opportunity to make GE Capital smaller. So what are the -- I assume you -- if you get an investor-friendly way. But what are the parameters on the GE Capital fit today? Is it risk? Is it the cash flow opportunities? You manage the SIFI requirements well, but still you want to get smaller. So just where is the optimal mix? And what are the parameters?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jeffrey Immelt (Executives)】\nSo again, Deane, what I would say is that the output on split is more the output than the input. So when I think about the strategy of the company, it's investing in really great businesses that leverage our core capability, improve the returns, things like that, right. But when I look at GE Capital, to me, it's about competitive advantage and returns and which businesses do we have the most competitive advantage in and can we generate an attractive return for our investors, given the requirements and getting the CCAR in '17 and things like that. And then the third thing is, I just -- we have to make it under our control. I think one of the good things we've done since the financial crisis is we've only talked about things that are in our own control, like doing the Synchrony spin and things like that. So I think when you factor in all those things, it's likely going to be small. We kind of say post-Synchrony, it's going to be less than $300 billion, and I think if you look at competitive advantage, returns, doing under our control, it's likely going to be smaller than that. We're on track to be part of the CCAR process in 2017. That's meaningful. That creates optionality in that time -- maybe more in that time period. So that's how I think about it, Deane, really. We're not in it just to -- we're not in it just to be in it. We're in it to generate a good return. Jeffrey?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jeffrey Sprague (Analysts)】\nJust pass this mic down one at a time. I was here first. Part of the portfolio change, in a sense, at least it looks like it de-risks the portfolio as capital gets smaller, but I'm thinking kind of the flipside of that. You mentioned projects a couple of times in Oil & Gas. Obviously, with Alstom, you're moving in to balance the plant and grid work and things that have kind of been the bane of the existence of some players over the years. How do you actually manage through that? You're hiring people from Bechtel, so there's a little bit of acknowledgment that you do need some help there. And is it having any impact on your cash conversion? It looks like your cash conversion's under a little bit of pressure.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jeffrey Immelt (Executives)】\nSo what I would say, Jeff, is the project stuff isn't something that we've actively seek-ed to increase or decrease. With the acquisition of Alstom, we have it. So we're learning about it. We're going to kind of assess our ability to run it and run it well as time goes on. We're in the integration process, so we'll learn a lot about it. But it's not -- it's neither a strategic imperative nor is it something we run away from. It just is a function of where we are. And from a cash conversion standpoint, I think any time progress and things like that go up and down as orders go up and down. But our businesses like Power & Water, Aviation, these were all 20%-plus return on capital businesses. So they still are good cash-generating, over-the-top businesses.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jeffrey Sprague (Analysts)】\nAnd just one other final thing, just on Alstom. So the -- will the restructuring actually be up in kind of the Corporate or segments? I would have thought a lot of that would have happened in purchase accounting and maybe...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jeffrey Immelt (Executives)】\nYes, it's going to be there as well, Jeff. So I think a lot of it's going to be purchase accounting. But in terms of -- there's always some changes that go to -- when we've done acquisitions in the past, there's been charges that have gone to Corporate, and that's where those will be. The caveat, the corollary of that says in Power & Water, you're going to see the Power & Water segment's going to be several hundred million dollars greater. They'll have Alstom coming in, in the second half. So that's where the upside is there, yes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Nigel Coe (Analysts)】\nJeff, can you just maybe talk about how 4Q orders have tracked? And I guess, specifically, have you've seen any change in behavior from customers? Either sort of the lower oil price or strong dollar, any change in behavior at all?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jeffrey Immelt (Executives)】\nSo Nigel, I'd say -- again, guys, I'm giving you the best I see today, right. So I would say slight positive orders to be for the fourth quarter would be my hunch based on where we're tracking here today, and I think other than Oil & Gas, Aviation commercial spares, average daily order rate is the highest since -- certainly, since I've been CEO. We'll take more locomotive orders in the second half of the year than any time in our -- really, in our history. So I don't see it yet, but I'm -- China will have positive orders in the quarter, right. So I think it's always good to take pause at a time like this and be thoughtful about what's happening and things like that. So I don't want to be Nostradamus or anything like that. I just am telling you kind of what we see, and that's what we see. Clearly, Oil & Gas customers are going to do a double clutch, right, as I said, go through what they're -- some projects will go forward. Some projects won't. But on balance, we're kind of counting for -- we track what they say about CapEx and then kind of plan for things to be at least that bad, if not worse.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Nigel Coe (Analysts)】\nAnd then, secondly, your friends in Bavaria have seen a very different power market in '15 than you do, price down heavily, margins down heavily. Can you just provide some perspective on the power market generally in '15, GE versus your competitors?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jeffrey Immelt (Executives)】\nI think the markets -- it's a competitive market, and it's a flat market. So I think that's what most of the kind of industry analysts talk about. That's kind of how we plan it. There's going to be a ton of H activity. There's going to be ton of large block activity. And then, Nigel, it just depends on where the -- there's -- a lot of the action is going to be in Japan next year. So you're going to see Japan's going to be a super big market. The U.S. is going to be a bigger market next year. So a lot of the pricing ends up being as much about the regional mix as it does about any given transaction, I think, in terms of where we go. But we're certainly not counting on the market to be superhot. Yes?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Attendee (Attendees)】\nJust a question on oil, is low oil good for GE or bad for GE?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jeffrey Immelt (Executives)】\nSo as you can imagine, we think a lot about that, particularly in the last months or so. I'd say, on balance, it's probably closer to watch. It's probably close to watch for a slight negative, but it's not a big negative is the way I would think about it. I'd say when our customers make more money, they spend more. But it's going to have an impact on our Oil & Gas business.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Attendee (Attendees)】\nAnd just following up from Steve's question about cash flow, if you look what you're generating versus you're spending on dividends and CapEx, there's sort of not much left to play with. So do we need to wait until CCAR to get more optionality? Can you actually -- are you in a position to actually use the Industrial balance sheet beyond '16 if needed? Or is that also part of the CCAR process?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jeffrey Immelt (Executives)】\nLook, I still think we have debt capacity on the Industrial balance sheet. We're not counting on it. And look, if you just look at our metrics, there's more cash in GE Capital than just the pure income dividend. But we're a part of a regulatory process, and we're going to have to think about that. But, guys, look, we've got a fantastic set of Industrial businesses, and we've got all the juice we need to continue to grow the Industrial franchise. So I feel pretty good about where we are in total, but there's not a day that I don't walk past Keith and say, \"How about one for the Gipper?\" It's -- okay - just. Hey, Joe?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Joseph Ritchie (Analysts)】\nJeff, so your Industrial gross margins the last few years have been on a bit of a decline, and some of that is due to we've had this massive equipment cycle. But look, you look at your service, backlog is up strongly. Some of your simplification efforts are coming through. You're starting to incentivize gross margin expansion. At what point do you start to see gross margins turn up?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jeffrey Immelt (Executives)】\nI think we've already told you that we expect to see them up next year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Joseph Ritchie (Analysts)】\nAnd is there a specific target then beyond next year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jeffrey Immelt (Executives)】\n50 basis points. I think we've said 50 a year for the next couple of years. We've kind of targeted everything through '16, so we're kind of saying 50 a year in '15 and '16. And so what we've done is we've underwritten that, I think, including as much mix as we can see. Mix has certainly hurt us, but it's not a good excuse. I think we can do a better job on gross margins.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Joseph Ritchie (Analysts)】\nAnd the follow-up is on the $135 billion in noncore assets that you're looking at potentially aggressively divesting. Can you talk a little bit about the timing? How are you thinking about potentially the use of those proceeds once you eventually divest of those assets?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jeffrey Immelt (Executives)】\nLook, I think the -- so we've talked a little bit about Australia consumer. You've seen the announcements on the Hungarian bank. We're going to keep aggressively going after all that consumer red assets, make those smaller. As we shrink, there ought to be more cash optionality in GE Capital. So we would expect that to be reflected over time in terms of how we go. And Synchrony should be a couple of billion dollar gain. It depends on where the stock is and where it closes and when we do it, and that will give us more optionality to continue to reduce red assets faster. Yes, let me go here. Yes, Julian?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Julian Mitchell (Analysts)】\nJust a question on Healthcare because you could -- from the outside, you could look at it and say, \"All it is, is sort of relentless cost-cutting.\" And also you had that slide 7 on...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jeffrey Immelt (Executives)】\nDifferent from every other business, huh?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Julian Mitchell (Analysts)】\nRight. Well, you had Slide 7 on improving the portfolio that had this sort of equals sign against Healthcare. I wasn't really sure what that meant. You had a leadership change recently at the business. So just...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jeffrey Immelt (Executives)】\nI think on the portfolio moves. So look, my view is that Amersham's going to generate its cost of capital. I'm glad we did it. Healthcare IT, we acquired IDX. We should have been at better position for the EMR wave. That's a pivot we should have done a better job at. These businesses pivot. These businesses -- think about the Power business, right. We went through the gas turbine bubble, but we've led in wind. We've led in distributed power. We've made every good pivot that the business has to make to be successful. So as these businesses, as Oil & Gas goes through a cycle, as Aviation goes through a cycle, as Power & Water has gone through maybe the biggest of all cycles, the team pivoted extremely well. And look, we were on the field with a pretty good franchise in Healthcare IT and just didn't execute as well as -- and that was the wave of growth, Julian, over the last 5 years. Now we're going to be able to catch the next wave, but that's what you should expect us to do. In terms of health care, look, the market has been -- we've gone through a massive consolidation. Customers have kind of sat on their wallet for a couple of years. Procedures have started to grow again. If you go back over time, procedure growth has always been a precursor for new capital equipment growth. My expectation is that the U.S. has a decent year. Europe is going to be very tough. China, instead of growing double digits, will probably grow high-single digits in health care. But I think all we're asking John to do is kind of low- to mid-single digit revenue growth, expand margins and be ready, be positioned.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Julian Mitchell (Analysts)】\nAnd then just on Industrial overall, you used to give some color on the margin, sort of puts and takes, value gaps, simplification, R&D. How does that look for next year putting Alstom aside?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jeffrey Immelt (Executives)】\nSo we've got another big year on -- we've got -- so we're expecting margin growth next year. So we expect to be 13%, let's say more or less; SG&A percentage of revenue next year. So we expect the SG&A to continue to come down, and we expect gross margins to be better. And that SG&A, Julian, will be a mixture of different stuff, but that's kind of the pathway we've shown you guys, and we expect to be on that pathway. Hey, John?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Attendee (Attendees)】\nSo the past few years have been characterized by industrial companies focusing their operations, either through tax-free spins or whatnot, and one of the thematics of your pitch very much was big companies like GE have competitive advantages to play in these global arenas. None of us would have expected that deal the size of Alstom as you had been bolt-on centric, I realize that's key theme to you. So how are you now, just as a starting point, thinking about big acquisitions, both in that context and then being opportunistic, considering you've done the biggest deal ever?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jeffrey Immelt (Executives)】\nLook, I just -- I like the way the company looks right now. I think, John, we basically have exited businesses that didn't use the GE Store. Appliances, we weren't in it to win, didn't use our core capability. Every business we have uses [indiscernible] to win. So [indiscernible] there. I like the company the way it looks today. The second thing I'd say is Alstom has a tremendous value-creating potential for our investors, but it's going to take all of our hard work to do it. We have plenty on our plate for next year to execute on, on Alstom, and I'm just -- we're just not that interested in doing another. Given we like what we have and we've got good value-creating work on our plate right now, that's enough for right now.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Attendee (Attendees)】\nYes. No, in fact, I think you said that's M&A for '15, '16, right?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jeffrey Immelt (Executives)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Attendee (Attendees)】\nSo okay, here's my sort of, kind of the corollary question. This whole supply-driven dynamics we're in with respect to oil, I guess a lot of us believe that this starts in '15 but spills -- unless there's some sort of shift, this is going to spill into '16. So you guys have made a big energy footprint commitment for presumably forever. Why not retain the flexibility if market conditions provide to go after and actually get much bigger in energy in certain locations, right?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jeffrey Immelt (Executives)】\nOkay, John, here's the -- I think it's a great question, but let me just tell you the way I think about it, which is I think in Oil & Gas -- we like Oil & Gas. I'll go back. We like Oil & Gas. We're diversified in Oil & Gas. We think this is a seminal business for the world. And we want to be in it, and we are in it. In this kind of volatility, GE is a very good person for any NOC or IOC to do business with, right. If you're an IOC and you want to test $65 a barrel on your new projects, you're going to come to GE to do that. So why would I pay anybody goodwill right now when basically our competitive position is better today, relatively speaking, than it was a month ago? I think that's the bottom line right now. There's just no reason to have to do that. Our relative competitive position in the businesses we're in has gotten better. These are cycles we know. We have fundamental strength that other people don't have. Look, we can all arm-wrestle over the value of a conglomerate, right. We can all arm-wrestle that one. This exactly the right time to want to be in a multi-business company, exactly the right time. Because our company is going to grow double-digit EPS next year even with a much worse oil case than the one we see today. Because Aviation is doing great, and Transportation is doing great, and we've got Alstom, and we've got a bunch of other stuff under way. Those are things that FMC doesn't have. Those are things that Schlum [ph] doesn't have. Those are things that none of these guys have. I like us in that field right now. Chris?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Attendee (Attendees)】\nJeff, a lot of talk about gross margin today. Haven't really noticed it being part of your messaging in the past so much. So I'm just wondering what caused that to precipitate at such a big line today. And just if you could comment on observation that if you combine that with your SG&A targets, it would seem to put you through the 17% margin target.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jeffrey Immelt (Executives)】\nSo look, I'd say we have had a tremendous amount of mix headwind, Chris. And I think before we talk publicly to you guys about stuff, it's typically stuff we've been working on for a year or 2. So we've kind of been percolating, I would say, the programs around gross margins, and it's the way you get to 17%. You got to have both things working, and we've got to allow a little bit of room for mix. It's just -- I think that's probably something we can do a better job of. So a, it's taken a while, we've got the programs in place; b, I always thought SG&A was a tremendous place to start just because the nature of the company had changed so vastly, right. Just the global footprint of GE is so different today than it was when I became CEO. Our cost was in the wrong place. Our processes were in the wrong place. So the simplification around SG&A was the best place to focus and, again, I think the combination of Dan and Jeff and Jamie and other people, we've got a good set of leaders to get it done.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Attendee (Attendees)】\nOkay. So the 50 basis [indiscernible] is independent of it?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jeffrey Immelt (Executives)】\nYes. So in other words, that includes mix, right.  Yes, yes. One or -- a couple more. Yes, how are you doing? Good.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Attendee (Attendees)】\nJust building on some of the previous questions, if we think about just your embedded assumptions for '15 and '16, either quantitative or qualitatively around price across the board.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jeffrey Immelt (Executives)】\nOn pricing of back -- on like pure price?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Attendee (Attendees)】\nYes. So I think you have a 2% to 5% organic growth target for '15. But obviously, you've been talking about a lot of initiatives around gross margin and then, obviously, you have a deflationary environment for oil, which will also put some...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jeffrey Immelt (Executives)】\nSo here's what I would say. I would say we had a positive value gap this year. Our expectation is that we have a positive value gap in '15, and I just think it's too soon to forecast around '16, right? So I think you've got a lot of positive momentum, a lot of things already in the backlog, and there's just nothing deflation -- or there's nothing inflationary in my world today fundamentally. So we're going to pricing pressure in Oil & Gas. We're going to have price -- maybe gas turbines pricing pressure, stuff like that. But there's nothing we really look at as incoming that's inflationary at all. So we would expect, in fact, to get incremental deflation with oil price as well.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Attendee (Attendees)】\nSo negative prices for '15 -- early '15?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jeffrey Immelt (Executives)】\nAgain, I think we look at a positive value gap, which would probably mean orders pricing will be flat to up slightly, and we'll get deflation, right. So you'll have a positive value gap. But how that plays out in '16, it's just too soon to think about it.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Attendee (Attendees)】\nAnd just the last question in some -- just around the change in some of the incentives, both at the, I guess, segments and at the C-suite. Could you just comment, what do you think you've changed for the better? Or what have you tried to do to try to modernize it?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jeffrey Immelt (Executives)】\nAgain, I think we always, as managers, maximize -- always want to maximize judgment in terms of how you -- so we've always done goals and objectives for the company. We flow those all the way down. They've always been numerically based forever, for 30 years I've been with GE. I think the change we've made is just much more formulaic. Really, it puts judgment aside and basically says, \"What do you want to see as an investor?\" And now you have 5,000 people that are going to get paid that way. So it's just complete pass-through from what you want in the company to what a executive band plant manager in Aviation, how they see their incentive comp, and it's always been directionally the same. Now it is linear, and I think that's -- in an uncertain world, that's certain. That's better. Maybe, Matt, you want to do one more?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Matthew Cribbins (Executives)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jeffrey Immelt (Executives)】\nWe'll do one more. Yes?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Attendee (Attendees)】\nJust sort of 2 questions quickly. One is just going back to the lack of likelihood of doing M&A in the oil and gas space. Is part of that related to the obvious that Alstom cost you 2 to 3x more than you had expected to spend on acquisitions a couple of years ago? Is that part of it, that you feel like you...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jeffrey Immelt (Executives)】\nIt's just -- I come back, guys, and say -- look, I mean, I don't think -- we've got every box covered that we want basically in the space and, fundamentally, I think our competitive position is better today than it was 6 months ago. So organically, we can generate a ton of value versus buying anything. So I never want to say never. I just don't view it as a strategic imperative for the company.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Attendee (Attendees)】\nOkay. And just secondly, can you talk a little bit about how you're looking out over the next years, how you're thinking about buyback versus dividend? And I know you've joked around offline of you won't retire until you get the dividend back up to the higher watermark. Can you talk to us a little bit about that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jeffrey Immelt (Executives)】\nLook, the buyback -- I think Synchrony was a tremendous way to, in a capital-efficient way, buy back a ton of shares at the same time. And so look, we talked about that more than a year ago. It's now coming more into focus, so that's a very capital-efficient way to do it. I think the company's well positioned organically. We still invest a lot in organic growth. So we think that's important, and people like -- a vast majority of our investors still like seeing the dividend grow in line with earnings. So I would say dividend in line with earnings. Let's do a great job of integration on Alstom and then see where we are in M&A, and let's do -- use incremental capital beyond that for buybacks. But Synchrony, right now, is the key driver for the buyback, and that's -- between dividend and buyback, $40 billion over 2 years is pretty good, pretty good.\r\nSo let me end there. The team, the team is all here. So cocktails, you can -- Lorenzo, I'm sure, will be a popular guy at cocktail. So I'll let Lorenzo on his own. And thanks, and we'll see you -- we'll circulate.

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you, Elise. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Red Hat's earnings call for the third quarter of our fiscal 2015. Speakers on today's call will be: Jim Whitehurst, President and CEO; and Charlie Peters, Executive Vice President and CFO.\r\nOur earnings press release was issued after the market closed today and may be downloaded from redhat.com on the Investor Relations page.\r\nAlso on this page, you will be able to find a historic reconciliation schedule of GAAP to non-GAAP financial metrics, as well as a schedule on currency rates.\r\nVarious remarks that we may make about the company's future expectations, plans, prospects, including the statements containing the words believe, anticipate, plan, project, estimate, expect, intend or will constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of the various important factors, including those discussed in the company's most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC as well as the Safe Harbor statement in today's press release.\r\nIn addition, any forward-looking statements represent our estimates or views only as of today, December 18, 2014, and these views and -- or estimates may change. While the company may elect to update forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so, even if our estimates or views do change. And therefore, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as representing our estimates or views as -- at any date subsequent to today.\r\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Tom, and let me add my welcome to all of you joining us on today's call.\r\nThe combination of continued strong demand and excellent sales execution contributed to the Q3 results that exceeded our guidance. Red Hat continues to lead the evolution of the enterprise data center towards open hybrid cloud computing. Let me start by sharing a few financial highlights for the third quarter.\r\nThis quarter marks the 11th straight quarter of mid- to high-teens growth in total revenue despite a 300 basis point FX headwind to Q3 revenue. Application development and emerging technology subscription revenue achieved 48% constant currency growth, the highest growth rate since we began to break out the measure. We have also generated strong cash flow growth of 40% -- operating cash flow growth of 40%, free cash flow growth of 48%, the highest growth rate in both those measures in the past 3 years.\r\nI would also like to share some operational highlights in 3 areas, including our expanding collaboration with our customers, expanding our product portfolio and expanding our routes to market with our partners. Let me drill into each of those categories.\r\nFirst, our customers. The significant expansion of our relationships with customers demonstrates Red Hat's increasing strategic position as they look to modernize their data centers. I'm pleased to announce that we again successfully renewed all 25 of our top 25 deals during the quarter. Moreover, those deals grew at approximately 120% of their previous annualized amounts.\r\nLooking at the 30 largest deals that closed in the quarter, these 30 deals continued to get bigger as customers entrust more of their data center needs to our open source solutions. Here are some metrics on the top 30 deals: First, all of the top 30 deals in Q3 were greater than $1 million, as was the case in each of the last 6 quarters; we also had 12 deals that were in excess of $5 million, a record for us in any quarter; and 3 of these deals were greater than $10 million, a record for us in a third quarter. Cross-selling was strong with 55% of the deals, including 1 or more components from our application development and emerging technologies offerings, which includes Middleware, OpenStack, OpenShift, CloudForms and storage.\r\nOf note, storage was a component of 20% of the top 30 deals, and that included both Red Hat Inktank Ceph as well as Red Hat Storage. Two of the top 30 deals were standalone deals comprised solely of offerings from our application development and emerging technologies portfolio, including our first multimillion dollar open to field.\r\nThe breadth of cross-selling also remains strong. Approximately 1/3 of the top 30 deals contained 5 or more Red Hat technologies. The top verticals this quarter were financial services and technology and media, where a number of deals increased in size and duration.\r\nThe second operational highlight I'd like to discuss is the continuing expansion of our portfolio of technologies. Let me share a few of our major announcements this quarter. In October, we announced the availability of Red Hat Storage Server 3.0, our solution for scale-out file storage. The capabilities of Red Hat Storage 3 are well suited for data-intensive enterprise workloads, including Big Data, operational analytics, enterprise file sharing and collaboration. With this latest release, Red Hat is helping to lead the charge in open software-defined storage.\r\nWe followed up this announcement with the release of Red Hat Cloud Infrastructure Version 5, or RHCI 5, in conjunction with the OpenStack conference in Paris. RHCI is a comprehensive management solution that supports customers as they move from traditional data center virtualization to OpenStack-powered clouds. With RHCI 5, users can now manage their virtualization and OpenStack environment simultaneously via a common platform.\r\nMost recently in November, we announced the beta of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Atomic Host, which provides a streamlined host platform that is optimized to run application containers. The software components include a RHEL -- included in RHEL Atomic, have been designed to enhance the performance, scalability and security of containers, creating the optimal platform on which to deploy and run application containers.\r\nRHEL Atomic extends container portability across the hybrid cloud by enabling deployment on physical hardware, certified high providers -- hypervisors, including RHEV and vSphere, private clouds such as RHEL OSP and public clouds, including Amazon Web Services and Google Compute platform. This ability to deploy anywhere, deploy everywhere, enables customers to choose the best platform for their container infrastructure.\r\nDrilling down into the third highlight, we announced expanded relationships with important alliance partners in order to accelerate the deployment of open hybrid cloud solutions. For example, WEBPRO's open source practice will design a joint go-to-market with Red Hat and deliver a comprehensive cloud strategy and solution for their clients, built around Red Hat OpenStack, OpenShift and Cloud forms. According to a recent global survey of telecommunication service providers conducted by Infonetics Research, 93% of telecommunications operators interviewed plan to deploy network functions for virtualization as carriers work to modernize their infrastructure. And OpenStack is emerging as the platform of choice for those NFE workloads.\r\nRed Hat continues to sign new global alliance partners in this space to collaboratively engineer superior grade solutions for communication service providers.\r\nIn summary, we're very pleased with our performance of the global team of Red Hat associates. I personally want to thank them for their achievements over the past quarter and calendar year. I remain excited about our prospects, our ability to solve customers' problems and the momentum we have in the market for open hybrid cloud solutions.\r\nBefore turning the call over to Charlie, I also want to welcome the team from our mobile back ended service acquisition, FeedHenry, who have officially joined Red Hat during this past quarter. They will help us expand into this new area, providing products and services for developers building mobile applications for the enterprise.\r\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Charlie.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Jim. Happy holidays to everybody on the line and we're hoping that our strong financial report for the third quarter will help put you in the holiday spirit. For starters, we are increasing our guidance for the third time this year, which I will detail later.\r\nBefore I share with you some of the highlights in the quarter, let me provide some background on the impact to our business from the volatility of foreign exchange rates. Nearly every currency we do business in weakened against the U.S. dollar when compared against Q3 last year, last quarter or against guidance. If you want the currency rate detail, please see the rates that are posted on our -- the IR section of our website. These rate changes negatively impacted both the income statement, where we use an average rate for the quarter, and the balance sheet, which is translated using spot rates at the end of the quarter. For instance, total revenue would have been $13 million higher using Q3 rates from last year, $11 million higher using rates from last quarter and $3 million higher using the rates given in September for guidance. As a result, I will provide both the U.S. dollar and constant currency results using the rates from Q3 last year.\r\nWith that, here are some of the Q3 highlights: Year-over-year, Q3 total revenue grew 18% in constant currency or 15% in U.S. dollars, both of which exceeded the high end of our revenue guidance due to strong sales execution and the benefit of better linearity in the quarter.\r\nNon-GAAP operating margin was 23.8% higher than guidance due to the top line outperformance and leverage in our business model. And operating cash flow was $133 million, and it was up 40% year-over-year.\r\nNow let's turn to our financial performance. On a geographic basis, this quarter produced solid double-digit growth across all of our major geographies despite the foreign exchange rate volatility. 62% of bookings came from the Americas, 25% from EMEA and 13% from Asia Pacific versus a split of 55%, 29%, 16% last year.\r\nThe Q3 sales route mix achieved our long-term annual goal of 70% from the channel and 30% from our direct sales force and compares to a 65%, 35% split in Q3 last year. Although we expect quarterly fluctuations, we are clearly executing well against our long-term annual goal.\r\nNow let's shift to the income statement. Third quarter revenue was $456 million, an increase of 18% in constant currency and 15% in U.S. dollars year-over-year and up 2% sequentially. To restate my earlier comment, there was a $3 million FX headwind from the rates used to give guidance in September. So if translated at those rates, revenue for Q3 would have been $459 million. Both subscriptions and services drove this strong performance in revenue, meaningfully exceeding our guidance. And subscription revenue of $395 million was also up 18% in constant currency and 15% in U.S. dollars year-over-year.\r\nHere is the breakdown of revenue by technology in U.S. dollars. Subscription revenue for infrastructure-related offerings was $333 million, up 14% in constant currency and 11% in U.S. dollars year-over-year. The subscription revenue for application development and emerging technologies offerings was $62 million. It was up 48% in constant currency or 45% in U.S. dollars. Application development and emerging technologies is now approximately 14% of total revenue. As a reminder, our infrastructure-related offerings include mainly RHEL and RHEL-related offerings, while our application development and emerging technology offerings includes Middleware, OpenStack, OpenShift, CloudForms and storage offerings. The training and services component of revenue was $61 million, up 19% in constant currency or 14% in U.S. dollars year-over-year, and up 9% sequentially in U.S. dollars. This acceleration was from both training and consulting.\r\nTraining revenues in Q3 grew across all of our major regions, driven by the launch of RHEL 7 and new OpenStack certifications. The increased consulting revenue was driven by a combination of OpenStack consulting and continued solid Middleware consulting demand.\r\nNow I'll discuss the rest of our results on a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock compensation, amortization expense, business acquisition-related cost and noncash interest expense related to convertible debt. Subscription gross margin was 93.9%, consistent with last quarter and Q3 last year. Training and services gross margin was 33.7%, down 230 basis points from Q3 last year as we added consultants to address the demand for our cloud technologies.\r\nOverall, gross margin was 85.9%, in line with last quarter and Q3 last year.\r\nQ3 non-GAAP operating expense came in at $283 million, up 16% year-over-year. Sales and marketing expenses grew 20%, in part due to our sponsorship of key industry events, including the OpenStack Summit in Paris and other major events in Las Vegas, Orlando and Barcelona. R&D grew 14% as we continued hiring engineers and added nearly a full quarter of expenses from the acquisition of our mobile back end as a service platform, FeedHenry. The additional investment in R&D was partially offset by foreign exchange since the majority of our engineering team is outside the U.S. We continued to show leverage in the G&A line, which is now 6.9% of revenue, 70 basis points lower than Q3 last year.\r\nQ3 non-GAAP operating income was $109 million, producing an operating margin of 23.8% and above our guidance. This higher result was due to the strong performance in the revenue line.\r\nNet interest and other income was $3 million. It's modestly higher than the $2 million we guided in September. One should note that for the non-GAAP presentation of financial results, the noncash interest expense related to convertible debt is excluded.\r\nOur estimated annual effective tax rate was 29% for both GAAP and non-GAAP results. The fully diluted weighted shares outstanding were approximately 188 million for both GAAP and non-GAAP results. And the lower share count reflects the weighted average impact of the acquisition during Q3 of $5.3 million Red Hat shares as a part of our accelerated stock repurchase program initiated in October.\r\nIncluding the accelerated stock repurchase, we have repurchased $535 million of Red Hat common stock so far this year.\r\nNon-GAAP diluted earnings per share came to $0.42, which is $0.02 above the high end of our guidance. This resulted in $0.06 per share better than Q3 last year, when one excludes tax benefits recorded in Q3 last year, which equaled $0.06.\r\nNow let's turn to the cash, excuse me, let's turn to the balance sheet and the cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $1.65 billion after the impact of the convertible debt on hedged accelerated stock repurchase and FeedHenry transactions. Quarterly operating cash flow was $133 million, up 40%, while purchases of property, plant and equipment remained low at $12 million. Thereby, producing free cash flow of $121 million, up 48% year-over-year.\r\nFX adjusted DSOs at 61 days continue to be within our target range and down 1 day from Q3 last year. As a reminder, since day sales outstanding is traditionally a measure of receivables compared to billings, our DSO is calculated using our billings proxy, which we calculate by adding revenue, plus the change in deferred revenue, on the cash flow statement.\r\nTotal deferred revenue at quarter end was $1.3 billion, an increase of $177 million or 16% over the same quarter a year ago. Current deferred revenue grew 17% in constant currency or 13% in U.S. dollars. Our long-term deferred revenue grew 29% in constant currency or 24% in U.S. dollars from 1 year ago.\r\nOver the past year, we have seen strong growth in long-term deferred, which generally reflects both a longer commitment and larger deal size for our customers. In Q3, the strategic commitment to Red Hat technologies has translated into the longest deal duration we've seen since 2009 at 24 months. Sequentially, deferred revenue increased approximately $48 million on strong sales execution and despite the weakening of the FX spot rates I discussed earlier. The FX headwind to the reported U.S. dollar deferred revenue was $36 million.\r\nTo isolate the FX impact, let me break down the components of deferred revenue for you. Short-term deferred revenue, which ended Q2 at $921 million, had a real increase in Q3 of $44 million, offset by $24 million as a result of changes in FX spot rates, ending Q3 at $941 million.\r\nLong-term deferred revenue, which ended Q2 at $331 million, had a real increase in Q3 of approximately $40 million, offset by $12 million, as a result of changes in FX spot rates, ending Q3 at $359 million.\r\nThe total increase in deferred revenue, without the impact of currency changes, was $84 million and can be found on our statement of cash flows.\r\nNow I'd like to turn to guidance. For purposes of this guidance, I have assumed that average foreign exchange rates for Q4 and the balance of the year are as they were on Monday. For example, the euro was $1.25 and JPY 117 equaled $1. These rates are weaker versus than the U.S. dollar than the FX rates I used in providing guidance in September, and can create an additional headwind versus those rates by up approximately $5 million to our updated Q4 and $8 million to our updated full year fiscal '15 revenue guidance being provided today. Most sell-side models have not yet been adjusted for these currency changes for Q4.\r\nThe estimated annual effective tax rate remains at 29% and the diluted share count is estimated at $186 million for Q4 and $189 million for the full year.\r\nWith those assumptions in mind, Q4 revenue is estimated to be approximately $456 million to $459 million in U.S. dollars. Subscription revenue should grow $5 million to $7 million, sequentially in U.S. dollars, even after taking into account a sequential headwind of about $8 million. That is $4 million from foreign exchange and $4 million due to 1 less subscription day in Q4 than Q3. It's a 90-day quarter versus a 91-day quarter.\r\nAs usual, we are forecasting a Q4 seasonal  sequential decline in services revenue due to lower utilization caused by the reduced number of consulting and training days during the holidays. This year, we expect the sequential services revenue decline to be in the $5 million to $6 million range, which will also reduce services gross margin by approximately 60 basis points.\r\nOperating margin is estimated to be in the 23% area. Interest and other income should be around $1 million and non-GAAP EPS estimated to be $0.40 to $0.41.\r\nSimply doing the math, full year guidance clearly needs to move higher again. With these assumptions in mind, the new full year revenue guidance is $1.782 billion to $1.785 billion, which represents 18% year-over-year constant currency growth at the top of the range, or 16% in U.S. dollars. We are effectively raising the revenue guidance in constant currency terms by approximately $10 million at the top of the range, versus guidance provided in September, making 3 consecutive quarters where we have raised revenue guidance on a constant currency basis.\r\nOur full year outlook for non-GAAP operating margin remains around 23%. Please note that this includes absorbing the dilution from 3 technology acquisitions this year, which, combined, will have about 110 basis point negative impact on operating margin for the year, but which we believe are important additions for the future of our emerging products portfolio.\r\nWe are also raising full year non-GAAP EPS guidance to $1.57 to $1.58 per share. And finally, we are raising our operating cash flow guidance by $30 million at the low end, and $10 million at the high end, to a new full year range of $600 million to $610 million.\r\nThere is no change in my CapEx estimate for the year, which remains at approximately $50 million, which is about $30 million lower than last year, resulting in expected free cash flow -- strong free cash flow growth.\r\nNow I want to switch to a personal note. As we look ahead to the next calendar year, I have begun to plan my retirement, so I can spend more time with my family, which now includes 6 grandchildren, including 2 born in each of the last 2 quarters. I've been with Red Hat over 10 years now, during which time the company's revenue has grown from about $150 million to our current fiscal 2015 estimate of slightly less than $1.8 billion. I'm extremely proud of what we've achieved, including building the world-class finance organization that we have in place.\r\nTo ensure an orderly and well-planned transition, I am announcing tonight it is my plan to retire in the next 12 months, during which time I'm going to work with Jim and the Board to accomplish a smooth transition in the financial readership of the company. I have also told Jim and the Board that I'll be there as long as they need me.\r\nTo summarize, it's been another strong quarter for Red Hat, and we are expecting a strong finish to fiscal year '15. The company has never been better positioned in the future than it is right now. Our portfolio of open source infrastructure software and services has never been broader or more current. All major product lines have been refreshed this year. The company is well staffed and well managed, and the world is embracing open source software like never before. And with Red Hat as the undisputed leader in open source, the future has never been brighter.\r\nI'll turn it back to Jim now for some concluding comments before we go to Q&A.\n\n---\n\nLet me pause to offer my sincere personal thanks to Charlie for his contributions to Red Hat. Charlie's been working here for a decade, he's been a great partner for me in the executive team, and he's been a key part of our success. So thank you, Charlie.\r\nLooking forward, it's my intention to conduct a thorough and deliberate process, beginning in the new year, to assess both great internal and external candidates. And we'll plan to name a successor when we think the time's right and the process has run its course. Luckily, Charlie's provided us a long runway to ensure an orderly transition. So thank you again, Charlie.\r\nWith that, I'd like to turn it over to the operator for our first question.",

On a geographic basis, this quarter produced solid double-digit growth across all of our major geographies despite the foreign exchange rate volatility. 62% of bookings came from the Americas, 25% from EMEA and 13% from Asia Pacific versus a split of 55%, 29%, 16% last year.\r\nThe Q3 sales route mix achieved our long-term annual goal of 70% from the channel and 30% from our direct sales force and compares to a 65%, 35% split in Q3 last year. Although we expect quarterly fluctuations, we are clearly executing well against our long-term annual goal.\r\nNow let's shift to the income statement. Third quarter revenue was $456 million, an increase of 18% in constant currency and 15% in U.S. dollars year-over-year and up 2% sequentially. To restate my earlier comment, there was a $3 million FX headwind from the rates used to give guidance in September. So if translated at those rates, revenue for Q3 would have been $459 million. Both subscriptions and services drove this strong performance in revenue, meaningfully exceeding our guidance. And subscription revenue of $395 million was also up 18% in constant currency and 15% in U.S. dollars year-over-year.\r\nHere is the breakdown of revenue by technology in U.S. dollars. Subscription revenue for infrastructure-related offerings was $333 million, up 14% in constant currency and 11% in U.S. dollars year-over-year. The subscription revenue for application development and emerging technologies offerings was $62 million. It was up 48% in constant currency or 45% in U.S. dollars. Application development and emerging technologies is now approximately 14% of total revenue. As a reminder, our infrastructure-related offerings include mainly RHEL and RHEL-related offerings, while our application development and emerging technology offerings includes Middleware, OpenStack, OpenShift, CloudForms and storage offerings. The training and services component of revenue was $61 million, up 19% in constant currency or 14% in U.S. dollars year-over-year, and up 9% sequentially in U.S. dollars. This acceleration was from both training and consulting.\r\nTraining revenues in Q3 grew across all of our major regions, driven by the launch of RHEL 7 and new OpenStack certifications. The increased consulting revenue was driven by a combination of OpenStack consulting and continued solid Middleware consulting demand.\r\nNow I'll discuss the rest of our results on a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock compensation, amortization expense, business acquisition-related cost and noncash interest expense related to convertible debt. Subscription gross margin was 93.9%, consistent with last quarter and Q3 last year. Training and services gross margin was 33.7%, down 230 basis points from Q3 last year as we added consultants to address the demand for our cloud technologies.\r\nOverall, gross margin was 85.9%, in line with last quarter and Q3 last year.\r\nQ3 non-GAAP operating expense came in at $283 million, up 16% year-over-year. Sales and marketing expenses grew 20%, in part due to our sponsorship of key industry events, including the OpenStack Summit in Paris and other major events in Las Vegas, Orlando and Barcelona. R&D grew 14% as we continued hiring engineers and added nearly a full quarter of expenses from the acquisition of our mobile back end as a service platform, FeedHenry. The additional investment in R&D was partially offset by foreign exchange since the majority of our engineering team is outside the U.S. We continued to show leverage in the G&A line, which is now 6.9% of revenue, 70 basis points lower than Q3 last year.\r\nQ3 non-GAAP operating income was $109 million, producing an operating margin of 23.8% and above our guidance. This higher result was due to the strong performance in the revenue line.\r\nNet interest and other income was $3 million. It's modestly higher than the $2 million we guided in September. One should note that for the non-GAAP presentation of financial results, the noncash interest expense related to convertible debt is excluded.\r\nOur estimated annual effective tax rate was 29% for both GAAP and non-GAAP results. The fully diluted weighted shares outstanding were approximately 188 million for both GAAP and non-GAAP results. And the lower share count reflects the weighted average impact of the acquisition during Q3 of $5.3 million Red Hat shares as a part of our accelerated stock repurchase program initiated in October.\r\nIncluding the accelerated stock repurchase, we have repurchased $535 million of Red Hat common stock so far this year.\r\nNon-GAAP diluted earnings per share came to $0.42, which is $0.02 above the high end of our guidance. This resulted in $0.06 per share better than Q3 last year, when one excludes tax benefits recorded in Q3 last year, which equaled $0.06.\r\nNow let's turn to the cash, excuse me, let's turn to the balance sheet and the cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $1.65 billion after the impact of the convertible debt on hedged accelerated stock repurchase and FeedHenry transactions. Quarterly operating cash flow was $133 million, up 40%, while purchases of property, plant and equipment remained low at $12 million. Thereby, producing free cash flow of $121 million, up 48% year-over-year.\r\nFX adjusted DSOs at 61 days continue to be within our target range and down 1 day from Q3 last year. As a reminder, since day sales outstanding is traditionally a measure of receivables compared to billings, our DSO is calculated using our billings proxy, which we calculate by adding revenue, plus the change in deferred revenue, on the cash flow statement.\r\nTotal deferred revenue at quarter end was $1.3 billion, an increase of $177 million or 16% over the same quarter a year ago. Current deferred revenue grew 17% in constant currency or 13% in U.S. dollars. Our long-term deferred revenue grew 29% in constant currency or 24% in U.S. dollars from 1 year ago.\r\nOver the past year, we have seen strong growth in long-term deferred, which generally reflects both a longer commitment and larger deal size for our customers. In Q3, the strategic commitment to Red Hat technologies has translated into the longest deal duration we've seen since 2009 at 24 months. Sequentially, deferred revenue increased approximately $48 million on strong sales execution and despite the weakening of the FX spot rates I discussed earlier. The FX headwind to the reported U.S. dollar deferred revenue was $36 million.\r\nTo isolate the FX impact, let me break down the components of deferred revenue for you. Short-term deferred revenue, which ended Q2 at $921 million, had a real increase in Q3 of $44 million, offset by $24 million as a result of changes in FX spot rates, ending Q3 at $941 million.\r\nLong-term deferred revenue, which ended Q2 at $331 million, had a real increase in Q3 of approximately $40 million, offset by $12 million, as a result of changes in FX spot rates, ending Q3 at $359 million.\r\nThe total increase in deferred revenue, without the impact of currency changes, was $84 million and can be found on our statement of cash flows.\r\nNow I'd like to turn to guidance. For purposes of this guidance, I have assumed that average foreign exchange rates for Q4 and the balance of the year are as they were on Monday. For example, the euro was $1.25 and JPY 117 equaled $1. These rates are weaker versus than the U.S. dollar than the FX rates I used in providing guidance in September, and can create an additional headwind versus those rates by up approximately $5 million to our updated Q4 and $8 million to our updated full year fiscal '15 revenue guidance being provided today. Most sell-side models have not yet been adjusted for these currency changes for Q4.\r\nThe estimated annual effective tax rate remains at 29% and the diluted share count is estimated at $186 million for Q4 and $189 million for the full year.\r\nWith those assumptions in mind, Q4 revenue is estimated to be approximately $456 million to $459 million in U.S. dollars. Subscription revenue should grow $5 million to $7 million, sequentially in U.S. dollars, even after taking into account a sequential headwind of about $8 million. That is $4 million from foreign exchange and $4 million due to 1 less subscription day in Q4 than Q3. It's a 90-day quarter versus a 91-day quarter.\r\nAs usual, we are forecasting a Q4 seasonal  sequential decline in services revenue due to lower utilization caused by the reduced number of consulting and training days during the holidays. This year, we expect the sequential services revenue decline to be in the $5 million to $6 million range, which will also reduce services gross margin by approximately 60 basis points.\r\nOperating margin is estimated to be in the 23% area. Interest and other income should be around $1 million and non-GAAP EPS estimated to be $0.40 to $0.41.\r\nSimply doing the math, full year guidance clearly needs to move higher again. With these assumptions in mind, the new full year revenue guidance is $1.782 billion to $1.785 billion, which represents 18% year-over-year constant currency growth at the top of the range, or 16% in U.S. dollars. We are effectively raising the revenue guidance in constant currency terms by approximately $10 million at the top of the range, versus guidance provided in September, making 3 consecutive quarters where we have raised revenue guidance on a constant currency basis.\r\nOur full year outlook for non-GAAP operating margin remains around 23%. Please note that this includes absorbing the dilution from 3 technology acquisitions this year, which, combined, will have about 110 basis point negative impact on operating margin for the year, but which we believe are important additions for the future of our emerging products portfolio.\r\nWe are also raising full year non-GAAP EPS guidance to $1.57 to $1.58 per share. And finally, we are raising our operating cash flow guidance by $30 million at the low end, and $10 million at the high end, to a new full year range of $600 million to $610 million.\r\nThere is no change in my CapEx estimate for the year, which remains at approximately $50 million, which is about $30 million lower than last year, resulting in expected free cash flow -- strong free cash flow growth.\r\nNow I want to switch to a personal note. As we look ahead to the next calendar year, I have begun to plan my retirement, so I can spend more time with my family, which now includes 6 grandchildren, including 2 born in each of the last 2 quarters. I've been with Red Hat over 10 years now, during which time the company's revenue has grown from about $150 million to our current fiscal 2015 estimate of slightly less than $1.8 billion. I'm extremely proud of what we've achieved, including building the world-class finance organization that we have in place.\r\nTo ensure an orderly and well-planned transition, I am announcing tonight it is my plan to retire in the next 12 months, during which time I'm going to work with Jim and the Board to accomplish a smooth transition in the financial readership of the company. I have also told Jim and the Board that I'll be there as long as they need me.\r\nTo summarize, it's been another strong quarter for Red Hat, and we are expecting a strong finish to fiscal year '15. The company has never been better positioned in the future than it is right now. Our portfolio of open source infrastructure software and services has never been broader or more current. All major product lines have been refreshed this year. The company is well staffed and well managed, and the world is embracing open source software like never before. And with Red Hat as the undisputed leader in open source, the future has never been brighter.\r\nI'll turn it back to Jim now for some concluding comments before we go to Q&A.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nLet me pause to offer my sincere personal thanks to Charlie for his contributions to Red Hat. Charlie's been working here for a decade, he's been a great partner for me in the executive team, and he's been a key part of our success. So thank you, Charlie.\r\nLooking forward, it's my intention to conduct a thorough and deliberate process, beginning in the new year, to assess both great internal and external candidates. And we'll plan to name a successor when we think the time's right and the process has run its course. Luckily, Charlie's provided us a long runway to ensure an orderly transition. So thank you again, Charlie.\r\nWith that, I'd like to turn it over to the operator for our first question.",
      "transcript_text3": "Charlie, congrats on the news. And we will miss you. It's really been an incredible journey for a whole lot of years.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Mark. Welcome to JPMorgan.\n\n---\n\nThank you very much. Jim, I wanted to ask you. There seems to be an industry-wide consensus beginning to form that everyone is standardizing on Red Hat OpenStack, and that Red Hat will be the winning standard. And at the same time, some of your partners are saying that -- they're comparing back to 2 years ago, that OpenStack was a bit of a science experiment, whereas today, they do think it's truly starting to penetrate its way into data centers. And so I understand it's still early days, but can you give us a little more color on what you're observing in the field and in the pipeline, just in terms of how is that activity evolving from downloads to pilots and to transactions?\n\n---\n\nYes. Sure, I'll try to fight it a little bit there. So again, I think you're right that OpenStack is starting to kind of mature to the point that we're starting to see people put it in production. Again, these types of things are multi-year journeys. Just a couple of factoids: So we had 3 of our top 30 deals included in OpenStack components. We had 1 deal that actually was not in the top 30, that was a 7-figure deal, so over $1 million that was entirely OpenStack. So that's obviously going into production.\r\nIn terms of kind of overall, if you kind of looked at both customers and kind of generally people at some point, kind of, in the past that we're engaged with at various stages of the buying cycle, it would be several hundred. So if that kind of gives you a sense of the several hundred, I'll say that we are doing better than our original plan was this year, which is good, but again, to see real large revenue build up over the next several years, but we are seeing good solid traction and again, several hundreds -- yes, these are generally bigger customers, so we feel pretty good about that. I'd also say -- but we have joint solutions with Dell and Cisco. Lot of interest there, and some really good early traction with those -- both those offerings.\n\n---\n\nGreat. Next question please, operator?\n\n---\n\nCharlie, congrats on quadrupling your stock price or being at least a key part of the management team and helping quadruple the stock price, so nice job. A question for Jim and Charlie: When you look at the long-term deferred revenue outperformance, can you help us understand how much of that is coming from the core RHEL business, versus the OpenStack business versus the Middleware business?\n\n---\n\nThanks, Kash. So good question. I would say that still, the biggest part of the business is the RHEL business, and a substantial part of the long-term deferred revenue is coming from the RHEL business. Yet we are seeing longer-term deals, particularly in the Middleware portion of the emerging product portfolio. But the largest percentage is going to be in RHEL.\n\n---\n\nSo in terms of the incremental change, it looks like Middleware is where you saw the positive delta on a sequential basis, is that a fair characterization?\n\n---\n\nWell, the emerging products portfolio in total grew very rapidly at 48% constant currency. So it was a very strong performance.\n\n---\n\nYes, I'd also say, it's really hard to fully break it out, because obviously the long-term deals are the larger deals that people do multiyear agreement, and those are generally multi-products, how you tease that out get a little hard as well.\n\n---\n\nI think, as Jim said in his prepared remarks, 55% of the largest deals had a component of -- multiple component with some of the emerging technology products included.\n\n---\n\nGot it. And if I could, Jim, one final for you. As you look at your RHEL installed base, could you offer some kind of attach rate target that you would be proud of for Red Hat to achieve, with respect to attaching OpenStack into your installed base? Even a broad range would be fine, but I'm just wondering, is it 10% or 60% or 80%?\n\n---\n\nAt this point we haven't actually looked at it this way. So I have to really, I honestly can't give you an answer to that. I'll have to go back and think about that a little more. That's -- because it's in its early days, we haven't looked at what we think the long-term attach rate could be. So I do think over time, well, you're going to have traditional workloads that are more scale up, that will be virtualized, but probably not on something like OpenStack, but almost any new, more modern workload is likely to be on a platform where it's likely to be OpenStack, so. But how you parse out those workloads, that would just be guessing at this point. So we'll have to get back to you with some more detail on that.\n\n---\n\nJust one more thing on OpenStack, and it's that, the largest deals this quarter were in the financial services and tax sector. And so you would think of the likely accounts are going to be the large -- the really large accounts in those sectors, in some of the other -- of the top 3 or 4 verticals.\n\n---\n\nNext question please, operator?\n\n---\n\nHey Charlie, I also extend my congratulation. By the way, it's a great quarter. Also, it's good to see so many, like that number of large deals. Just wondering if you could give some more color on what -- on those large deals, what's driving the record number of deals? And how should we think about, going forward?\n\n---\n\nVery simply, we're becoming much more strategic to our customers. And so, as they look to invest in us as their primary middleware provider, as they look to us to doing storage or other major areas, they are much more willing to make multi-year commitments to those technologies, so. I just really -- as we get more strategic, you see people obviously spending more, but also making longer-term commitments as they choose Red Hat as a long-term partner.\n\n---\n\nGreat. Thanks.\n\n---\n\nNext question please, operator?\n\n---\n\nThanks, Charlie. I'll offer my congratulations as well. You certainly will be missed. Clearly you guys had a strong quarter across the board. I think what really impressed me was to hear the storage, it was now at 20% of the top deals. I'm curious, could you give us some use cases, maybe whose adopting storage, and what type of growth would you expect to see there?\n\n---\n\nWell, again, we're seeing it in multiple areas. Obviously, you get the kind of the standard, people dollars in scale out. So when you think about kind of a scale out, NAS type solution, we see it there, we have customers using it underneath Hadoop is another use case for it, as people look at analytics. It's obviously in some of our OpenStack deals, Inktank, we see quite a bit there. So it's really kind of a mix of those use cases. It's only those 3, kind if you think about, kind of analytics, Big Data and scale out, kind of NAS type solutions. Obviously, those are kind of big and growing. And we've continued to come out with incremental functionality, so we kind of saw, it's hard to say what when we see it in billings. Certainly, a step change in interest when we added snapshotting, and I think we're -- as a kind of add those new features, kind of the more mature features, every time we do, we see a, kind of a step up in relative interest level in the products.\n\n---\n\nGreat. Next question please, operator?\n\n---\n\nAgain, congratulations on a really nice quarter and sorry to see you go, Charlie. It's really been a pleasure. A question for Charlie on operating margins. You exceeded sort of what we had in our model, in our initial expectations, but we're still looking at operating margins down a little bit on a year-on-year basis, because of the acquisitions that we made and those investments. And I think a lot of the debate around Red Hat now has been on sort of how those operating margins progress on a go-forward basis. I know it's too early to get, sort of the FY '16 view, but just from, maybe a more structural perspective, how should we be thinking about that operating margin profile for Red Hat, longer-term? Perhaps when you're no longer with us at Red Hat?\n\n---\n\nJust so we can save time for everybody else, thank everyone, but we'll go straight to the questions, I'm not going anywhere any time soon. We're going to -- this is going to take a little while for Jim to work through the process, but thank you on that. In terms of operating margins, what I would point out is, I think what should be helpful to everyone is the breakdown of product revenues that we provided since the beginning of the year, showing that our -- basically our Linux business has got a very steady midteens growth and it's doing very, very well. And then maybe the item that everyone needs to focus on is if emerging technology products, growing at 48% constant currency, that is a hypergrowth business that we are investing in. And as you point out, this year, there were 3 technology acquisitions that added to that portfolio, but it includes middleware, OpenStack, OpenShift, cloud forms and storage and we are investing for growth there. We're building out consulting for those functions, we're building our training and support and so forth. And I think you should expect -- so as long as we see that kind of hypergrowth that -- we don't want to miss the opportunity. So we're investing for growth.\r\nAs you said, on the fourth quarter call, we'll have a detailed breakdown of guidance for next year and we can talk about it at that point in time. I would just like to reemphasize, we think there's lots of leverage in our model that with gross margins such as we have, our operating margins can certainly improve over time.\n\n---\n\nGreat. Next question please, operator?\n\n---\n\nOne thing we haven't talked about in last couple of quarters is the cloud business, Linux through the cloud. How is that this quarter? Did it increase? And anything on the comments you have there about either the impact of that on billings? And/or how much of that is new versus existing business?\n\n---\n\nThank you. So the cloud business continues to grow nicely. It's still a very small part of the business. And so I intentionally did not leave it in my -- put it in the comments this time. But I can tell you, it still is the fastest growing part of the business. It grew faster than the emerging products. But it's not at a total level that it's worth spending a lot of time on. We think it's doing well, as we discussed last quarter. It does have some impact on billings, because it's recognized in arrears not paid in advance by a year or more. But it's not a big number yet. When we get to a run rate of $100 million, that would mean it would be $25 million in a quarter, we will call out that as a, as the benchmark. And we're sometime from being at that benchmark.\n\n---\n\nGreat. Next question please, operator?\n\n---\n\nI was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how you see the use of Atomic unfolding? I know it's a new initiative. I'm just wondering, do you see this as the primary avenue that people will run containers on? And what are you doing to help drive the security and management aspects for containers that CIOs tell us that they're looking for?\n\n---\n\nYes, that's a great question, Heather. I think that's still playing out. Just reflecting on several of our big customers who have committed to working with us on containers through this quarter, literally just picking 3 of them. One of them is that multimillion dollar OpenShift deal we talked about. And obviously that's our OpenShift D3 which will G.A. next year, that is basically OpenShift, right, which does include RHEL Atomic and Docker and Kubernetes. Another one of our big, long term customers actually is running full RHEL, and running Docker on full RHEL. And another very large customer is rolling it out on Atomic alone. So we see people -- if there's still kind of different points of view about how people run containers, and I think, so those are just 3 big examples of using containers, using kind of 3 different approaches to do it. So I really do think we'll see how it plays out. I will say, we've seen kind of tremendous growth in interest around OpenShift as we announced version 3 in beta, which is basically RHEL Atomic, Docker containers and Kubernetes. And so, a lot of people see that, a nice way to kind of, to operate. But it's hard to see -- we have multiple people doing multiple things on it going forward. In terms of security, especially, obviously, the features in Linux around whether it's C groups around to allocate and guarantee performance or SE Linux around security or areas because of our heritage in Linux that we're very, very involved in. So we'll continue to drive those hard. Also, obviously we're an operating system company, so we say this, but we do see this in security as well. The container and the operating system need to work together. And so -- and by having those work kind of together, we think we can offer very, very good security. And so we are continuing to drive those roadmaps. But the exact deployment model, we're still watching it develop and different customers choosing different ways to do it.\n\n---\n\nGreat. Next question please, operator.\n\n---\n\nIt was interesting to see a surge in large deals and a decline in the percentage of business done direct, suggesting that maybe your channel partners are helping drive some of these larger deals. I wonder if you could give us -- if that's true, and if you could give us a little color on that.\n\n---\n\nThat's an accurate conclusion. So we've had -- we had a couple of very large deals come through our channel partners. And we put a lot of investment in our channel team internally here over the last 6, 7 years or more. And they have put a lot of work and investment in terms of building up a really strong group of channel partners, and they're just doing a good job. But you're right, so large deals are actually coming through channel partners now as well, it's not just direct.\n\n---\n\nIs it SIs or is it beyond SIs?\n\n---\n\nIt's beyond.\n\n---\n\nPrimarily not SIs. We are doing good things with SIs, we announced this [indiscernible] thing, or I talked a little bit about it on the call. But we -- it's beyond SIs. It's primarily not SIs, but we are making progress with it as well.\n\n---\n\nOperator next question, please.\n\n---\n\nCharlie, the billings were obviously a lot stronger than all of us expected. When you look at the large deals that came in, were all those actually billed in the quarter? Or were some of those bought and you kind of left it for future billings?\n\n---\n\nWe had -- most of them actually are long term, with an off-balance-sheet component. And as we normally do, we will go through in detail some of those, those kind of statistics and off balance sheet backlog on our fourth quarter call. But it was good growth in both the growing for quarter average, billings proxy and also good growth in the -- just a standalone quarter billings proxy.\n\n---\n\nNext question, please.\n\n---\n\nAs I sit here and listen to you talk about storage, Middleware, Docker, OpenStack, OpenShift. It seems to me like your whole portfolio of products now -- I mean, and your results are really strong. Are you seeing sort of a change in buying behavior? I mean, are companies becoming more comfortable, would you say, with open source as a platform in general?\n\n---\n\nFirst of all, welcome back, Katherine. And it's been several years now. It means that the buying environment is quite different. It's easy for us now to see top levels in the IT organization. Jim has frequent visits with CEOs and CIOs, and they talk about the broad portfolio. It's not just an operating system conversation anymore. So the whole environment is different. And I think we're far more relevant to our customers today. There's no doubt that open source is right now, is the default choice. It's no longer an acceptable alternative. It's the default choice. People start there. They want an open source alternative.\n\n---\n\nI actually had a customer say to me, \"Oh yeah, Red Hat, you don't get fired for buying Red Hat.\" So you know we must be getting mainstream.\n\n---\n\nThank you. Next question operator, please.\n\n---\n\nCharlie, I know I'm not supposed to wish you off. But at least can I say -- can I at least say you're going to leave very big shoes to fill for the next person.\n\n---\n\nWell literally, that's true.\n\n---\n\nI couldn't resist, I apologize. So hey, just kind of following up on one of the prior questions about long-term deferred. What is influencing customer behavior to effectively pay upfront for multiyear deals?\n\n---\n\nWell, I mean, I don't think that there is any change in how people are paying in terms of the mix of paying upfront or not. I think we're doing a lot more bigger deals.\n\n---\n\nAnd I think customers choose, in some cases, to pay upfront, in many cases they pay 1 year at a time, in which case it influences the off balance sheet backlog, but to your point, the reason why long-term goes up, these are customers that have paid upfront. And customers have different reasons. Sometimes it's because of their own accounting or their own procurement. We do not incent customers with substantial discounts to pay upfront, unless of course, there's some credit problem. It's to our advantage to have the money up front from that particular customer. That's not normally the case. So it's just the deals are getting larger, and a lot more of them.\n\n---\n\nNext question, please?\n\n---\n\nJim, I wanted to ask you a product question about the next version of OpenShift.  You touched a little bit about it with Heather's question. But the partners that we've spoken to, that have had a look at it, they seem very excited about version 3, with the containers technology embedded in it. And they're telling us they think it's further along technologically than the other path solutions in the market. Can you comment on how strategically significant this offering could be next year for you?\n\n---\n\nWell, frankly, I think strategically, it could be quite significant. The difference really -- we call it OpenShift, but OpenShift is basically a brand name for bringing key upstream technologies to market, right? So it's Docker and its Kubernetes. So it's not -- obviously, people look at OpenShift versus Cloud Foundry. It's not like Cloud Foundry, where Red Hat's kind of developed this thing and we're out pushing it. This is actually taking the key upstream projects and bundling them in an enterprise consumable way, ready for production. So if you can imagine for an enterprise, and you're saying, \"Well, I'm really excited about containers, and I'm really excited about Kubernetes, and I'd like to put it in production next year.\" Frankly, Red Hat's the only partner you can bring in who, with OpenShift can stay, \"Here it is, ready for production to run in your data center.\" Right? So I think one of the reasons you see a lot of interest is it's a product that, kind of with a GA, allows you to really run containers and Kubernetes in a very stable way in production, and there's really no other way to do it. So there are people downloading stuff, playing around with it, developers like it, but for the first time, enterprise operations can actually run this at scale and run it confidently. So I think it's a major step forward. And again, it's right that it's modeled, it's not our view of what technology should win, it's us bringing the key technologies to enterprises in a very consumable way, and I think that excites our customers.\n\n---\n\nGreat. Next question please.\n\n---\n\nQuestion has to do with long-term deferred, and these larger deals, guys. Has that had any -- I know, Charlie, you've talked a little bit about renewal rates, and just generally, that they were around 80%, sort of like same-store renewal rates. Has that -- has these longer deals, has that had any influence on what a calculated renewal rate would be?\n\n---\n\nI don't think that -- not necessarily. Well, I think the statistics that we talk about every quarter, the top 25 deals that are supposed to renew in the quarter, did they renew or not, and that's a very consistent statistic of 100% over the last 5 or 6 years, it may have been 2 or 3 deals in the top -- in that top group that maybe didn't renew. And -- but when they do renew, they almost always grow to a bigger number. This quarter, it was 120% higher. It doesn't necessarily mean that it has gone to deferred revenue. It depends upon the billing arrangement, whether it would be billed upfront, in which case you might have a long-term deferred revenue if it's a multiyear deal, or it might go to off balance sheet backlog if it's to be billed at some point in the future. So I don't think you can really draw that -- draw a conclusion from it. And I would say this, that over a fair amount of time, on a dollar basis, we've probably have done somewhere in the neighborhood of 80% renewal rate of dollars.\n\n---\n\nJohn, I do think you bring up the good point. I hadn't really gone through the math this way. But it adds, certainly, larger deals we have higher renewal rates on, or say, larger customers, we have a larger -- higher renewal rates on, and obviously our average customer size is growing, so hopefully that bodes well for increasing renewal rates in total, just on that math.\n\n---\n\nRight.\n\n---\n\nGreat. Next question please, operator?\n\n---\n\nOne of the products that we haven't heard much of on the call here is CloudForms. Could you guys maybe talk about customers who are using that outside of Red Hat environments?\n\n---\n\nWhen you say outside of Red Hat environments, could you clarify? We didn't...\n\n---\n\nYes, I'm sorry. To manage non-Red Hat products, third-party type of solutions.\n\n---\n\nWithout naming customers, we have had customers buy CloudForms to manage total VMware environment. So it is a product that could manage a Red Hat environment, a VMware environment or it help managing public cloud workloads.\n\n---\n\nYes. But to be honest, just because of our go-to-market, most customers are using it because obviously, Red Hat's talking to them, are using it to manage a hybrid environment that includes both Red Hat and it's typically, VMware environment. So most actually do have some Red Hat. I'm not aware of a lot of, kind of purely VMware. There are a few that have come along, but because of our go-to-market motions, obviously going to our customers, most of them are also using it for primarily in a hybrid way, but managing VMware workloads primarily or who are on Amazon.\n\n---\n\nGreat. Next question please?\n\n---\n\nYou mentioned that 20% of your large deals included a storage component, and I know that SEL and Gluster do plug in well to OpenStack. Wondered if you could talk just a little bit about where you're seeing traction for the storage products? How much of it is connected to OpenStack, and how much of it is other value props outside of that framework?\n\n---\n\nWell, the majority of the deals are outside of OpenStack. Without a doubt, right? They're, again, it's a lot of scale out. It shouldn't be surprising. In most of our new products like that, it starts off with people who are looking to save money, have some choice, et cetera. So most of the deals are that, and not in OpenStack. But again, we do see some decent traction, again with OpenStack as well. Looking at our large deals, it's kind of a bit up all over the board. There were a couple that are related to OpenStack, but the majority are other use cases. And again, that's generally kind of scale out file, and some around big data and analytics.\n\n---\n\nGreat. Next question please?\n\n---\n\nJim, you talked a little bit about OpenStack. Can you talk about specific use cases that people are using OpenStack for? And can it be cannibalistic to your RHEL platform deployments? It will be helpful if you can give us some color on some existing clients who purchased OpenStack, and how their contract values did versus prior to buying OpenStack?\n\n---\n\nWell, again, OpenStack, because of its nature, obviously is primarily scale out type workloads, not kind of scale up, which means they're typically new applications. So this would be people like banks who are basically saying, I want to put my new workloads on this platform. But when you say new workloads, these are applications being built with the knowledge that they're going to be running on an elastic scale out type of environment. We have -- again, it's certainly the early adopters now, so media and telco -- sorry, media and technology, telco and financial services. And it's generally for their kind of new application. You don't see -- I think you're not -- I can't go into details of all the deals, I'm just talking about the ones that I've been involved in. You don't see a lot of people saying I'm building this thing and migrating a lot of existing workloads. It's more typically people, basically saying I want to put all my new workloads on this new architecture. And that's just generally true, and people don't like to rearchitect applications in general. And so you generally see people have a kind of low-cost scale up, kind of virtualized environment, and it's kind of a scale out, kind of OpenStack environment and they're trying to put the new applications on the scale out environment.\n\n---\n\nGreat. Next question please, operator.\n\n---\n\nCongratulations on a strong quarter. Jim, are you seeing any RHEL 7 uptake yet? Has that begun to make a contribution? And related to that, can you talk about RHEL 7.1 and just any early interest levels from your beta customers?\n\n---\n\nWell, I mean, there is a little bit of RHEL 7 out there, but recognize, almost nobody's going to put a 0.0 over lease truly in production. So there's a lot of playing around with it, a lot of excitement around it, but it'll really be 0.1 before we'll see it in large scale in production. Again, it's hard for me to give a lot of color on that, because just as a reminder, when a customer buys a subscription, they buy a subscription to RHEL. They can decide to use 5, 6 or 7. And so it doesn't have an impact on our economics. And therefore, frankly, we don't track that super closely. Obviously, more advanced features hopefully will lead to more sales. But for our traditional customers, that doesn't affect us, on whether they're running 6 or 7. So we should start seeing a real move in production with the 0.1, and that's kind of normal. We don't expect to see that on the 0.0.\n\n---\n\nGreat. Next question please.\n\n---\n\nJust really quickly, Jim, can you talk -- or Charlie, could you talk to us about the emerging product adoption, I guess x-JBoss, just from a geographic perspective? I assume the U.S. is sort of leading the charge on that front, and I guess if that's true, could you just talk about what needs to happen, in terms of seeing some uptake in Europe or Asia over the next year, to sort of compliment what you're seeing in the U.S., if that indeed is the way it's going right now?\n\n---\n\nI think I have the grift of your question. First of all, we don't break down emerging products any finer than that, but I would say this: I think it's a fair assumption that a lot of our largest accounts and reference accounts, they generally start with new products closer to home. And then, as they are comfortable and we are comfortable in it, it begins to populate into Europe, Latin America, Asia and so forth. So since Middleware has been around longer than some of the other technologies in that group, it's probably a safe assumption that it is spread more globally than some of the newer technologies. But I can tell you that every region in the world is looking to sell each of the technologies in emerging products growth. And so we think all the regions are going to have good prospects for those products.\n\n---\n\nOperator, we have time for one more question, please.\n\n---\n\nI just was wondering if you could comment on the competitive environment around your core Linux business. How much is really driving this big deal momentum in the core business? Is it -- are you seeing -- continuing to see standardization? Are their Windows displacements? Is there -- how much UNIX displacement is still left to be done?\n\n---\n\nYes. And I'll start with that. I mean, displacement, there's some. But we primarily take share by winning new workloads. And I think what's we're seeing is a very substantial move towards net new workloads going on Linux, relative to Windows. And so we -- the IDC shows that we're taking market share. I think we believe taking market shares, we're winning those that new workloads. We can -- we still do a lot of UNIX to Linux, a lot of our large customers, as they get deeper with us, continue to move more workloads over. So we still see that as a movement and that will continue going forward. There are some replatformings from Windows to Linux, but it's much more customers saying, my next generation of applications is going to go on Linux, and especially when you start moving to scale-out cloud type infrastructures, whether that's OpenStack or something else. Those are heavily, heavily Linux based. And obviously, our customers want to have their scale-up applications are already on RHEL. And so they want to stay on that standard environment, so that just kind of keeps those growing for us.\n\n---\n\nGreat. Thanks, Jim. Thanks, operator. This concludes our third quarter earnings call. We look forward to speaking to everyone the rest of this year and into next year. And happy holidays, everyone.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Mark Murphy (Analysts)】\nCharlie, congrats on the news. And we will miss you. It's really been an incredible journey for a whole lot of years.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nThanks, Mark. Welcome to JPMorgan.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Murphy (Analysts)】\nThank you very much. Jim, I wanted to ask you. There seems to be an industry-wide consensus beginning to form that everyone is standardizing on Red Hat OpenStack, and that Red Hat will be the winning standard. And at the same time, some of your partners are saying that -- they're comparing back to 2 years ago, that OpenStack was a bit of a science experiment, whereas today, they do think it's truly starting to penetrate its way into data centers. And so I understand it's still early days, but can you give us a little more color on what you're observing in the field and in the pipeline, just in terms of how is that activity evolving from downloads to pilots and to transactions?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nYes. Sure, I'll try to fight it a little bit there. So again, I think you're right that OpenStack is starting to kind of mature to the point that we're starting to see people put it in production. Again, these types of things are multi-year journeys. Just a couple of factoids: So we had 3 of our top 30 deals included in OpenStack components. We had 1 deal that actually was not in the top 30, that was a 7-figure deal, so over $1 million that was entirely OpenStack. So that's obviously going into production.\r\nIn terms of kind of overall, if you kind of looked at both customers and kind of generally people at some point, kind of, in the past that we're engaged with at various stages of the buying cycle, it would be several hundred. So if that kind of gives you a sense of the several hundred, I'll say that we are doing better than our original plan was this year, which is good, but again, to see real large revenue build up over the next several years, but we are seeing good solid traction and again, several hundreds -- yes, these are generally bigger customers, so we feel pretty good about that. I'd also say -- but we have joint solutions with Dell and Cisco. Lot of interest there, and some really good early traction with those -- both those offerings.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tom McCallum (Executives)】\nGreat. Next question please, operator?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kash Rangan (Analysts)】\nCharlie, congrats on quadrupling your stock price or being at least a key part of the management team and helping quadruple the stock price, so nice job. A question for Jim and Charlie: When you look at the long-term deferred revenue outperformance, can you help us understand how much of that is coming from the core RHEL business, versus the OpenStack business versus the Middleware business?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nThanks, Kash. So good question. I would say that still, the biggest part of the business is the RHEL business, and a substantial part of the long-term deferred revenue is coming from the RHEL business. Yet we are seeing longer-term deals, particularly in the Middleware portion of the emerging product portfolio. But the largest percentage is going to be in RHEL.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kash Rangan (Analysts)】\nSo in terms of the incremental change, it looks like Middleware is where you saw the positive delta on a sequential basis, is that a fair characterization?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nWell, the emerging products portfolio in total grew very rapidly at 48% constant currency. So it was a very strong performance.\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nYes, I'd also say, it's really hard to fully break it out, because obviously the long-term deals are the larger deals that people do multiyear agreement, and those are generally multi-products, how you tease that out get a little hard as well.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nI think, as Jim said in his prepared remarks, 55% of the largest deals had a component of -- multiple component with some of the emerging technology products included.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kash Rangan (Analysts)】\nGot it. And if I could, Jim, one final for you. As you look at your RHEL installed base, could you offer some kind of attach rate target that you would be proud of for Red Hat to achieve, with respect to attaching OpenStack into your installed base? Even a broad range would be fine, but I'm just wondering, is it 10% or 60% or 80%?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nAt this point we haven't actually looked at it this way. So I have to really, I honestly can't give you an answer to that. I'll have to go back and think about that a little more. That's -- because it's in its early days, we haven't looked at what we think the long-term attach rate could be. So I do think over time, well, you're going to have traditional workloads that are more scale up, that will be virtualized, but probably not on something like OpenStack, but almost any new, more modern workload is likely to be on a platform where it's likely to be OpenStack, so. But how you parse out those workloads, that would just be guessing at this point. So we'll have to get back to you with some more detail on that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nJust one more thing on OpenStack, and it's that, the largest deals this quarter were in the financial services and tax sector. And so you would think of the likely accounts are going to be the large -- the really large accounts in those sectors, in some of the other -- of the top 3 or 4 verticals.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tom McCallum (Executives)】\nNext question please, operator?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sitikantha Panigrahi (Analysts)】\nHey Charlie, I also extend my congratulation. By the way, it's a great quarter. Also, it's good to see so many, like that number of large deals. Just wondering if you could give some more color on what -- on those large deals, what's driving the record number of deals? And how should we think about, going forward?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nVery simply, we're becoming much more strategic to our customers. And so, as they look to invest in us as their primary middleware provider, as they look to us to doing storage or other major areas, they are much more willing to make multi-year commitments to those technologies, so. I just really -- as we get more strategic, you see people obviously spending more, but also making longer-term commitments as they choose Red Hat as a long-term partner.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nGreat. Thanks.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tom McCallum (Executives)】\nNext question please, operator?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matthew Hedberg (Analysts)】\nThanks, Charlie. I'll offer my congratulations as well. You certainly will be missed. Clearly you guys had a strong quarter across the board. I think what really impressed me was to hear the storage, it was now at 20% of the top deals. I'm curious, could you give us some use cases, maybe whose adopting storage, and what type of growth would you expect to see there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nWell, again, we're seeing it in multiple areas. Obviously, you get the kind of the standard, people dollars in scale out. So when you think about kind of a scale out, NAS type solution, we see it there, we have customers using it underneath Hadoop is another use case for it, as people look at analytics. It's obviously in some of our OpenStack deals, Inktank, we see quite a bit there. So it's really kind of a mix of those use cases. It's only those 3, kind if you think about, kind of analytics, Big Data and scale out, kind of NAS type solutions. Obviously, those are kind of big and growing. And we've continued to come out with incremental functionality, so we kind of saw, it's hard to say what when we see it in billings. Certainly, a step change in interest when we added snapshotting, and I think we're -- as a kind of add those new features, kind of the more mature features, every time we do, we see a, kind of a step up in relative interest level in the products.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tom McCallum (Executives)】\nGreat. Next question please, operator?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Keith Weiss (Analysts)】\nAgain, congratulations on a really nice quarter and sorry to see you go, Charlie. It's really been a pleasure. A question for Charlie on operating margins. You exceeded sort of what we had in our model, in our initial expectations, but we're still looking at operating margins down a little bit on a year-on-year basis, because of the acquisitions that we made and those investments. And I think a lot of the debate around Red Hat now has been on sort of how those operating margins progress on a go-forward basis. I know it's too early to get, sort of the FY '16 view, but just from, maybe a more structural perspective, how should we be thinking about that operating margin profile for Red Hat, longer-term? Perhaps when you're no longer with us at Red Hat?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nJust so we can save time for everybody else, thank everyone, but we'll go straight to the questions, I'm not going anywhere any time soon. We're going to -- this is going to take a little while for Jim to work through the process, but thank you on that. In terms of operating margins, what I would point out is, I think what should be helpful to everyone is the breakdown of product revenues that we provided since the beginning of the year, showing that our -- basically our Linux business has got a very steady midteens growth and it's doing very, very well. And then maybe the item that everyone needs to focus on is if emerging technology products, growing at 48% constant currency, that is a hypergrowth business that we are investing in. And as you point out, this year, there were 3 technology acquisitions that added to that portfolio, but it includes middleware, OpenStack, OpenShift, cloud forms and storage and we are investing for growth there. We're building out consulting for those functions, we're building our training and support and so forth. And I think you should expect -- so as long as we see that kind of hypergrowth that -- we don't want to miss the opportunity. So we're investing for growth.\r\nAs you said, on the fourth quarter call, we'll have a detailed breakdown of guidance for next year and we can talk about it at that point in time. I would just like to reemphasize, we think there's lots of leverage in our model that with gross margins such as we have, our operating margins can certainly improve over time.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tom McCallum (Executives)】\nGreat. Next question please, operator?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Turits (Analysts)】\nOne thing we haven't talked about in last couple of quarters is the cloud business, Linux through the cloud. How is that this quarter? Did it increase? And anything on the comments you have there about either the impact of that on billings? And/or how much of that is new versus existing business?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nThank you. So the cloud business continues to grow nicely. It's still a very small part of the business. And so I intentionally did not leave it in my -- put it in the comments this time. But I can tell you, it still is the fastest growing part of the business. It grew faster than the emerging products. But it's not at a total level that it's worth spending a lot of time on. We think it's doing well, as we discussed last quarter. It does have some impact on billings, because it's recognized in arrears not paid in advance by a year or more. But it's not a big number yet. When we get to a run rate of $100 million, that would mean it would be $25 million in a quarter, we will call out that as a, as the benchmark. And we're sometime from being at that benchmark.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tom McCallum (Executives)】\nGreat. Next question please, operator?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Heather Bellini (Analysts)】\nI was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how you see the use of Atomic unfolding? I know it's a new initiative. I'm just wondering, do you see this as the primary avenue that people will run containers on? And what are you doing to help drive the security and management aspects for containers that CIOs tell us that they're looking for?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nYes, that's a great question, Heather. I think that's still playing out. Just reflecting on several of our big customers who have committed to working with us on containers through this quarter, literally just picking 3 of them. One of them is that multimillion dollar OpenShift deal we talked about. And obviously that's our OpenShift D3 which will G.A. next year, that is basically OpenShift, right, which does include RHEL Atomic and Docker and Kubernetes. Another one of our big, long term customers actually is running full RHEL, and running Docker on full RHEL. And another very large customer is rolling it out on Atomic alone. So we see people -- if there's still kind of different points of view about how people run containers, and I think, so those are just 3 big examples of using containers, using kind of 3 different approaches to do it. So I really do think we'll see how it plays out. I will say, we've seen kind of tremendous growth in interest around OpenShift as we announced version 3 in beta, which is basically RHEL Atomic, Docker containers and Kubernetes. And so, a lot of people see that, a nice way to kind of, to operate. But it's hard to see -- we have multiple people doing multiple things on it going forward. In terms of security, especially, obviously, the features in Linux around whether it's C groups around to allocate and guarantee performance or SE Linux around security or areas because of our heritage in Linux that we're very, very involved in. So we'll continue to drive those hard. Also, obviously we're an operating system company, so we say this, but we do see this in security as well. The container and the operating system need to work together. And so -- and by having those work kind of together, we think we can offer very, very good security. And so we are continuing to drive those roadmaps. But the exact deployment model, we're still watching it develop and different customers choosing different ways to do it.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tom McCallum (Executives)】\nGreat. Next question please, operator.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Steven Ashley (Analysts)】\nIt was interesting to see a surge in large deals and a decline in the percentage of business done direct, suggesting that maybe your channel partners are helping drive some of these larger deals. I wonder if you could give us -- if that's true, and if you could give us a little color on that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nThat's an accurate conclusion. So we've had -- we had a couple of very large deals come through our channel partners. And we put a lot of investment in our channel team internally here over the last 6, 7 years or more. And they have put a lot of work and investment in terms of building up a really strong group of channel partners, and they're just doing a good job. But you're right, so large deals are actually coming through channel partners now as well, it's not just direct.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Steven Ashley (Analysts)】\nIs it SIs or is it beyond SIs?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nIt's beyond.\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nPrimarily not SIs. We are doing good things with SIs, we announced this [indiscernible] thing, or I talked a little bit about it on the call. But we -- it's beyond SIs. It's primarily not SIs, but we are making progress with it as well.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tom McCallum (Executives)】\nOperator next question, please.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Brent Thill (Analysts)】\nCharlie, the billings were obviously a lot stronger than all of us expected. When you look at the large deals that came in, were all those actually billed in the quarter? Or were some of those bought and you kind of left it for future billings?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nWe had -- most of them actually are long term, with an off-balance-sheet component. And as we normally do, we will go through in detail some of those, those kind of statistics and off balance sheet backlog on our fourth quarter call. But it was good growth in both the growing for quarter average, billings proxy and also good growth in the -- just a standalone quarter billings proxy.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tom McCallum (Executives)】\nNext question, please.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Katherine Egbert (Analysts)】\nAs I sit here and listen to you talk about storage, Middleware, Docker, OpenStack, OpenShift. It seems to me like your whole portfolio of products now -- I mean, and your results are really strong. Are you seeing sort of a change in buying behavior? I mean, are companies becoming more comfortable, would you say, with open source as a platform in general?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nFirst of all, welcome back, Katherine. And it's been several years now. It means that the buying environment is quite different. It's easy for us now to see top levels in the IT organization. Jim has frequent visits with CEOs and CIOs, and they talk about the broad portfolio. It's not just an operating system conversation anymore. So the whole environment is different. And I think we're far more relevant to our customers today. There's no doubt that open source is right now, is the default choice. It's no longer an acceptable alternative. It's the default choice. People start there. They want an open source alternative.\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nI actually had a customer say to me, \"Oh yeah, Red Hat, you don't get fired for buying Red Hat.\" So you know we must be getting mainstream.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tom McCallum (Executives)】\nThank you. Next question operator, please.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jason Maynard (Analysts)】\nCharlie, I know I'm not supposed to wish you off. But at least can I say -- can I at least say you're going to leave very big shoes to fill for the next person.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nWell literally, that's true.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jason Maynard (Analysts)】\nI couldn't resist, I apologize. So hey, just kind of following up on one of the prior questions about long-term deferred. What is influencing customer behavior to effectively pay upfront for multiyear deals?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nWell, I mean, I don't think that there is any change in how people are paying in terms of the mix of paying upfront or not. I think we're doing a lot more bigger deals.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nAnd I think customers choose, in some cases, to pay upfront, in many cases they pay 1 year at a time, in which case it influences the off balance sheet backlog, but to your point, the reason why long-term goes up, these are customers that have paid upfront. And customers have different reasons. Sometimes it's because of their own accounting or their own procurement. We do not incent customers with substantial discounts to pay upfront, unless of course, there's some credit problem. It's to our advantage to have the money up front from that particular customer. That's not normally the case. So it's just the deals are getting larger, and a lot more of them.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tom McCallum (Executives)】\nNext question, please?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Brian Schwartz (Analysts)】\nJim, I wanted to ask you a product question about the next version of OpenShift.  You touched a little bit about it with Heather's question. But the partners that we've spoken to, that have had a look at it, they seem very excited about version 3, with the containers technology embedded in it. And they're telling us they think it's further along technologically than the other path solutions in the market. Can you comment on how strategically significant this offering could be next year for you?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nWell, frankly, I think strategically, it could be quite significant. The difference really -- we call it OpenShift, but OpenShift is basically a brand name for bringing key upstream technologies to market, right? So it's Docker and its Kubernetes. So it's not -- obviously, people look at OpenShift versus Cloud Foundry. It's not like Cloud Foundry, where Red Hat's kind of developed this thing and we're out pushing it. This is actually taking the key upstream projects and bundling them in an enterprise consumable way, ready for production. So if you can imagine for an enterprise, and you're saying, \"Well, I'm really excited about containers, and I'm really excited about Kubernetes, and I'd like to put it in production next year.\" Frankly, Red Hat's the only partner you can bring in who, with OpenShift can stay, \"Here it is, ready for production to run in your data center.\" Right? So I think one of the reasons you see a lot of interest is it's a product that, kind of with a GA, allows you to really run containers and Kubernetes in a very stable way in production, and there's really no other way to do it. So there are people downloading stuff, playing around with it, developers like it, but for the first time, enterprise operations can actually run this at scale and run it confidently. So I think it's a major step forward. And again, it's right that it's modeled, it's not our view of what technology should win, it's us bringing the key technologies to enterprises in a very consumable way, and I think that excites our customers.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tom McCallum (Executives)】\nGreat. Next question please.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John DiFucci (Analysts)】\nQuestion has to do with long-term deferred, and these larger deals, guys. Has that had any -- I know, Charlie, you've talked a little bit about renewal rates, and just generally, that they were around 80%, sort of like same-store renewal rates. Has that -- has these longer deals, has that had any influence on what a calculated renewal rate would be?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nI don't think that -- not necessarily. Well, I think the statistics that we talk about every quarter, the top 25 deals that are supposed to renew in the quarter, did they renew or not, and that's a very consistent statistic of 100% over the last 5 or 6 years, it may have been 2 or 3 deals in the top -- in that top group that maybe didn't renew. And -- but when they do renew, they almost always grow to a bigger number. This quarter, it was 120% higher. It doesn't necessarily mean that it has gone to deferred revenue. It depends upon the billing arrangement, whether it would be billed upfront, in which case you might have a long-term deferred revenue if it's a multiyear deal, or it might go to off balance sheet backlog if it's to be billed at some point in the future. So I don't think you can really draw that -- draw a conclusion from it. And I would say this, that over a fair amount of time, on a dollar basis, we've probably have done somewhere in the neighborhood of 80% renewal rate of dollars.\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nJohn, I do think you bring up the good point. I hadn't really gone through the math this way. But it adds, certainly, larger deals we have higher renewal rates on, or say, larger customers, we have a larger -- higher renewal rates on, and obviously our average customer size is growing, so hopefully that bodes well for increasing renewal rates in total, just on that math.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nRight.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tom McCallum (Executives)】\nGreat. Next question please, operator?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Brad Reback (Analysts)】\nOne of the products that we haven't heard much of on the call here is CloudForms. Could you guys maybe talk about customers who are using that outside of Red Hat environments?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nWhen you say outside of Red Hat environments, could you clarify? We didn't...\n\n---\n\n【質問: Brad Reback (Analysts)】\nYes, I'm sorry. To manage non-Red Hat products, third-party type of solutions.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nWithout naming customers, we have had customers buy CloudForms to manage total VMware environment. So it is a product that could manage a Red Hat environment, a VMware environment or it help managing public cloud workloads.\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nYes. But to be honest, just because of our go-to-market, most customers are using it because obviously, Red Hat's talking to them, are using it to manage a hybrid environment that includes both Red Hat and it's typically, VMware environment. So most actually do have some Red Hat. I'm not aware of a lot of, kind of purely VMware. There are a few that have come along, but because of our go-to-market motions, obviously going to our customers, most of them are also using it for primarily in a hybrid way, but managing VMware workloads primarily or who are on Amazon.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tom McCallum (Executives)】\nGreat. Next question please?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Walter Pritchard (Analysts)】\nYou mentioned that 20% of your large deals included a storage component, and I know that SEL and Gluster do plug in well to OpenStack. Wondered if you could talk just a little bit about where you're seeing traction for the storage products? How much of it is connected to OpenStack, and how much of it is other value props outside of that framework?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nWell, the majority of the deals are outside of OpenStack. Without a doubt, right? They're, again, it's a lot of scale out. It shouldn't be surprising. In most of our new products like that, it starts off with people who are looking to save money, have some choice, et cetera. So most of the deals are that, and not in OpenStack. But again, we do see some decent traction, again with OpenStack as well. Looking at our large deals, it's kind of a bit up all over the board. There were a couple that are related to OpenStack, but the majority are other use cases. And again, that's generally kind of scale out file, and some around big data and analytics.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tom McCallum (Executives)】\nGreat. Next question please?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Abhey Lamba (Analysts)】\nJim, you talked a little bit about OpenStack. Can you talk about specific use cases that people are using OpenStack for? And can it be cannibalistic to your RHEL platform deployments? It will be helpful if you can give us some color on some existing clients who purchased OpenStack, and how their contract values did versus prior to buying OpenStack?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nWell, again, OpenStack, because of its nature, obviously is primarily scale out type workloads, not kind of scale up, which means they're typically new applications. So this would be people like banks who are basically saying, I want to put my new workloads on this platform. But when you say new workloads, these are applications being built with the knowledge that they're going to be running on an elastic scale out type of environment. We have -- again, it's certainly the early adopters now, so media and telco -- sorry, media and technology, telco and financial services. And it's generally for their kind of new application. You don't see -- I think you're not -- I can't go into details of all the deals, I'm just talking about the ones that I've been involved in. You don't see a lot of people saying I'm building this thing and migrating a lot of existing workloads. It's more typically people, basically saying I want to put all my new workloads on this new architecture. And that's just generally true, and people don't like to rearchitect applications in general. And so you generally see people have a kind of low-cost scale up, kind of virtualized environment, and it's kind of a scale out, kind of OpenStack environment and they're trying to put the new applications on the scale out environment.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tom McCallum (Executives)】\nGreat. Next question please, operator.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gregg Moskowitz (Analysts)】\nCongratulations on a strong quarter. Jim, are you seeing any RHEL 7 uptake yet? Has that begun to make a contribution? And related to that, can you talk about RHEL 7.1 and just any early interest levels from your beta customers?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nWell, I mean, there is a little bit of RHEL 7 out there, but recognize, almost nobody's going to put a 0.0 over lease truly in production. So there's a lot of playing around with it, a lot of excitement around it, but it'll really be 0.1 before we'll see it in large scale in production. Again, it's hard for me to give a lot of color on that, because just as a reminder, when a customer buys a subscription, they buy a subscription to RHEL. They can decide to use 5, 6 or 7. And so it doesn't have an impact on our economics. And therefore, frankly, we don't track that super closely. Obviously, more advanced features hopefully will lead to more sales. But for our traditional customers, that doesn't affect us, on whether they're running 6 or 7. So we should start seeing a real move in production with the 0.1, and that's kind of normal. We don't expect to see that on the 0.0.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tom McCallum (Executives)】\nGreat. Next question please.\n\n---\n\n【質問: S. Kirk Materne (Analysts)】\nJust really quickly, Jim, can you talk -- or Charlie, could you talk to us about the emerging product adoption, I guess x-JBoss, just from a geographic perspective? I assume the U.S. is sort of leading the charge on that front, and I guess if that's true, could you just talk about what needs to happen, in terms of seeing some uptake in Europe or Asia over the next year, to sort of compliment what you're seeing in the U.S., if that indeed is the way it's going right now?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nI think I have the grift of your question. First of all, we don't break down emerging products any finer than that, but I would say this: I think it's a fair assumption that a lot of our largest accounts and reference accounts, they generally start with new products closer to home. And then, as they are comfortable and we are comfortable in it, it begins to populate into Europe, Latin America, Asia and so forth. So since Middleware has been around longer than some of the other technologies in that group, it's probably a safe assumption that it is spread more globally than some of the newer technologies. But I can tell you that every region in the world is looking to sell each of the technologies in emerging products growth. And so we think all the regions are going to have good prospects for those products.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tom McCallum (Executives)】\nOperator, we have time for one more question, please.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Edward Maguire (Analysts)】\nI just was wondering if you could comment on the competitive environment around your core Linux business. How much is really driving this big deal momentum in the core business? Is it -- are you seeing -- continuing to see standardization? Are their Windows displacements? Is there -- how much UNIX displacement is still left to be done?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nYes. And I'll start with that. I mean, displacement, there's some. But we primarily take share by winning new workloads. And I think what's we're seeing is a very substantial move towards net new workloads going on Linux, relative to Windows. And so we -- the IDC shows that we're taking market share. I think we believe taking market shares, we're winning those that new workloads. We can -- we still do a lot of UNIX to Linux, a lot of our large customers, as they get deeper with us, continue to move more workloads over. So we still see that as a movement and that will continue going forward. There are some replatformings from Windows to Linux, but it's much more customers saying, my next generation of applications is going to go on Linux, and especially when you start moving to scale-out cloud type infrastructures, whether that's OpenStack or something else. Those are heavily, heavily Linux based. And obviously, our customers want to have their scale-up applications are already on RHEL. And so they want to stay on that standard environment, so that just kind of keeps those growing for us.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tom McCallum (Executives)】\nGreat. Thanks, Jim. Thanks, operator. This concludes our third quarter earnings call. We look forward to speaking to everyone the rest of this year and into next year. And happy holidays, everyone.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you, Christine. Good morning, and welcome to Enbridge Inc.'s 2015 Guidance and Investment Community Update Call. With me this morning are Al Monaco, President and CEO; Richard Bird, Executive Vice President, Corporate Development; Wanda Opheim, Senior Vice President, Finance; Guy Jarvis, President, Liquids Pipeline; and Leigh Kelln, Vice President, Investor Relations and Enterprise Risk. This call is webcast, and I encourage those listening on the phone lines to view the supporting slides, which are available on our website. A replay and podcast of the call will be available later today, and a transcript will be posted to our website shortly thereafter. The Q&A format will be the same as always. We'll take questions from the analyst community first and then invite questions from the media. I would also remind you that Leigh and I will be available after the call for any follow-up questions that you might have.\r\nBefore we begin, I'd like to point out that we will refer to forward-looking information in connection with Enbridge and the subject matter of today's call. By its nature, this information contains forecasts, assumptions and expectations about future outcomes, so we remind you it is subject to the risks and uncertainties affecting every business, including ours. This slide include the summary of the significant factors and risks that could affect future outcomes for Enbridge, which are also discussed more fully in our public disclosure filings available on both the SEDAR and Edgar systems. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Al Monaco.\n\n---\n\nGood morning, everyone. Today, we'll be elaborating on the news release we issued yesterday after market. It's something we're excited about, so thank you for joining us today. \r\nI'm going to start with our 2015 earnings per share guidance, which is the normal course part of the call at this time of the year for us. I'll then provide the overarching strategic context and objective of the change we're planning to our financial structure. Then I'll expand on both the Canadian restructuring plan and the revised dividend payout policy, which has been approved by our board. Wanda Opheim will update related changes to the funding waterfall from what I just talked about and provide more color on the 2015 EPS guidance. By the way, our CFO, John Wheeling, is unable to be here today due to illness. I'll come back with some takeaways after Wanda's discussion, and then we'll open it up for questions. \r\nBy the way, because of what we will be covering today, we're going to be using a fair number of acronyms. So if at all possible, it will be good if you could follow along with the slides, if you can. \r\nTurning now to Slide 4. We expect our 2015 EPS to be between $2.05 to $2.35 per share. That's ahead of 2014 growth as we pick up the full year benefit of new projects coming into service this year and part of the year for those slated to be completed in 2015. The range that we have here excludes the partial year impact we'd expect from the plant drop down, which I'll come to shortly.\r\nThe guidance is in line with our expected long-term average annual growth rate of 10% to 12% in EPS. So all-in strong growth expected for next year, and Wanda will get into more of that later on. \r\nOnto Slide 5. Before we get to the drop down, I'd like to provide some broader strategic context. Many of you will recognize this graphic we have here from comments that we made at Enbridge Day. \r\nFirst, there'll be no change to our business strategy and our priorities. We have a strong 5-year plan. Earnings and dividend growth are driven by our $44 billion record growth capital program that will require a focus on execution and funding, and both of those, we believe, are progressing very well. Our sponsored vehicles are positioned to support the strategic plan, and for the Income Fund, we're now articulating a very explicit plan for how it will be involved. And we have a longer-term strategy rebouncing our asset mix through increased investment in natural gas and power infrastructure, which our revised financial structure will give us better tools to make that happen over time. The key point of all this is that the changes we're planning to our financial structure are designed to generate even greater value from our existing business plan. All that said, our first and most important priority, as always, is safe and reliable operation of our systems, and optimizing the financial structure will also benefit our customers through lower practical infrastructure services cost that we provide. That's even more important given the volatile oil price environment our industry is facing today.\r\nSlide 6 is a reminder the value drivers underpinning that strategic plan. The first is the $44 billion capital program, I just referred to, that generates 10% to 12% annual EPS growth through 2018 on average and provides a strong contribution beyond 2018 as well. This growth is very visible with 3/4 of the capital outlook being commercially secured. That's the blue part of those bars. And this capital and these projects will deliver strong risk-adjusted returns. Executing this capital program is the priority, so you can think of this as the cake, part of the icing and the cake. \r\nOnto Slide 7. The other main value driver here is that the earnings and cash flow from the program are highly visible because of our reliable business model and conservative financial management. That's backed up by our track record of delivering on what we guide to, both on an annual and long-term basis, as you see in the chart here, and you can also see that dividend growth has nicely tracked EPS growth. So this is part of the cake as well and that's where most of the value will come from, so we'll continue to ensure we're baking that cake with the right care and attention. \r\nNow let's move on to how we plan to optimize the base plan, and this is the icing on the cake. \r\nSlide 8 is a high-level overview of what our optimization plan involves and what's it intended to accomplish. There are 2 parts to this, and they work in tandem. The first part is a large scale drop down from Enbridge to Enbridge Income Fund or EIF. EIF is a majority owned by Enbridge and has public ownership as well through Enbridge Income Fund Holdings. I'll refer to that later as EIFH. This concept isn't new to us, and it's similar to the drop downs we've been doing but it's much bigger because it involves all of our Canadian Liquids Pipelines assets and some renewable assets as well. I'll come back to provide you a bit more on how this will work. \r\nNow the second part is a change our dividend payout policy from 60% to 70% of earnings to a 75% to 85% range, which we are now in good position to do. Together, these 2 changes generate increased value for both Enbridge and Enbridge Income Fund Holdings in 4 ways: accelerated earnings and dividend growth, enhanced competitiveness through a reduced cost of capital, transforming Enbridge Income Fund to a higher-growth vehicle and reinforcing growth beyond 2018. So the goal overall is to enhance the value of our existing plan both for Enbridge and the Fund. So let's go through in a bit more detail now on the first part of the optimization.\r\nSlide 9 is an overview of the proposed drop down plan. Basically, we're looking at transferring assets with the book value of $17 billion plus another $15 billion of associated secured growth capital. In our math, we're assuming an EBITDA multiple in the low to mid-teens but ultimately the valuation will be considered by a special committee of Enbridge Income Fund, and of course, our own Enbridge Board. Valuations, a little bit higher than in previous drop downs but these assets have a lot more built-in growth. That includes the embedded growth and the tilted returns on a good chunk of the secured capital that you saw earlier, which we talked about in the past. So in that range of pricing, the drop down will be accretive to both Enbridge and EIFH. Part of that comes through Enbridge's 25% incentive distribution rate in the Fund. \r\nThe plan is to provide a formal offer to EIF in the first quarter of 2015 or thereabouts, with a targeted closing by mid-2015. \r\nGiven the size of the drop down, Enbridge would take back a significant amount of EIF units as consideration. So we'd initially have about a 90% economic interest in the Fund at closing, which will be whittled down over time, and I'll come back to that as well. \r\nSlide 10 is a simplified picture of our current structure with the Canadian Liquids Pipelines assets held by Enbridge Pipelines Inc., that is EPI, and Enbridge Pipelines Athabasca, EPA. So now we're fully into the acronyms I referred to earlier. The transaction will involve the tax-free drop down of both EPI and EPA into Enbridge Income Fund. EPI also holds some renewable assets, which will also move to Enbridge Income Fund with the Liquids Pipelines assets. You'll notice EPI also holds Enbridge Energy Partners, but that will stay with Enbridge. \r\nSo now that we've got those acronyms down, moving to Slide 11. It shows how things will look after the drop down. As you can see, EPI and EPA would be held by Enbridge Income Fund or EIF. Enbridge would directly hold about 88% in EIF or about 90% economic interest when you include our ownership through our investment in EIFH. Enbridge would still control EIF where the assets would be held, and there will be no change to the operations or the strategic development of the business. \r\nI'll go through the assets included now on the next 3 slides. I'll go through these quickly as most people are quite familiar with these. \r\nSide 12 shows the Canadian Mainline assets. The biggest component is the Canadian portion of our mainline Western Canada to U.S. Midwest conduit. That's the largest and most complex crude oil system in the world. And by the way, the U.S. portion of the mainline is held through Enbridge Energy Partners or U.S. MLP. So this group of assets, of $10 billion on Enbridge's books, with an associated secured growth capital program of $9 billion. \r\nSlide 13 shows the component of our oil sands regional system. Not as big as the mainline system but still a substantial size, $6 billion of assets, and an associated secured growth program of another $6 billion. \r\nAnd Slide 14 shows the 4 wind projects that would be included in the transfer, about $1 billion of assets. So in summarizing this part, when you add all of these up, it represents a transaction of about $17 billion in assets and $15 billion in secured growth investments, and obviously, that's on a book basis or the cost of new projects.\r\nTurning now to Slide 15. As I referred to earlier, this planned drop down differs from the others we've done because of its size, and that means it's too big for EIFH to take in one bite. \r\nThat's due to the relative size of the EIFH's public float even though that's been growing in recent years. So EIFH's investment in the Fund will be staged over several years, but the drop will certainly provide it with a massive growth engine. \r\nAt this point, we expect EIFH's annual equity raise to be in the range of $600 million to $800 million. Enbridge will maintain its approximate 20% interest in EIFH as well, so investing another $150 million to $200 million annually. Importantly, Enbridge will invest an additional equity directly in EIF of about $1.5 billion over the next 3 to 4 years. So the point is, we'll remain focused on funding of the organic program. \r\nAs EIFH continues to invest in EIF, its ownership will rise and Enbridge will decline from about 90% on execution to around 80% by 2018. Relative to our previous ad hoc approach to drop downs, the beauty about this structure is that Enbridge will have a permanent and effective avenue to release capital beyond 2018. And as we've shown in the past, we expect to have attractive opportunities to deploy that capital.\r\nNow onto Slide 16. A very important outcome of this plan is the transformation of EIFH into a high-dividend growth vehicle. Here is why that happens. Historically, the payout policy of EIF and EIFH has been managed to provide a smooth 1% growth in distributions. That's how it was originally designed. In actual fact, the 1% growth has been supplemented in most years by some organic growth in the assets or periodic drops. I think that's generated good value for unitholders, but to be fair, that approach has been less than predictable from an investor's perspective. Going forward, we have a transparent plan and a large inventory assets for EIFH to invest a significant amount of capital every year. \r\nWe expect this will provide dependable growth in dividends for EIFH of about 10% on average for 2015 through 2018. That growth would come about from an increasing investment in the assets but also participation in the upward-tilted cash flow stream from the new assets. So clearly, a great opportunity for EIFH. \r\nNow let's look at this from Enbridge's Inc.'s perspective. Slide 17 illustrates one of the big benefits to Enbridge EPS accretion from the drop. The ultimate picture will depend, of course, on the definitive terms of the drop down, which will have to be agreed to by a committee of EIF directors. Based on our assumptions, we anticipate an uplift in Enbridge EPS of about 10% on an annualized basis in the first full year following execution. The chart here shows the annualized effect in 2015. The accretion grows thereafter at about the same rate as the base 10% to 12% EPS rates. So each subsequent year is uplifted by about the same 10% through to and including 2018. So that's the financial outlook from the drop. Now let's have a look at what changes on how growth is funded going forward. \r\nFirst, I think it's important to note that Enbridge will continue to coordinate the integrated development of the investment opportunities across the entire asset base as we do today. In terms of Slide 18, it lays out the types of infrastructure investments that will be funded by each of our sponsored vehicles and those funded by Enbridge. So the only change you see here in red is the primary source of equity funding for 2 of the investment opportunity types. For Canadian Liquids Pipelines development, we'll now look to EIFH as a primary source of equity funding in the same way that EEP is the primary source of the U.S. Liquids funding opportunities. Enbridge will be prepared to continue to fund any part of that, which EIFH couldn't raise on favorable terms. This is exactly what we do with our U.S. assets. \r\nEnbridge continues to fund gas pipeline development, Canadian midstream, gas distribution and new growth platforms like power and international. \r\nWe're onto Slide 19 now. Before we get to the second part of the optimization plan, I'll recap the benefits we see from the drop down part. The most obvious and quantifiable benefit is the higher EPS and dividend per share growth through 2018. The drop down would also capitalize on EIFH's ability to raise equity as a low-cost source of funding for our organic growth program, that will also provide more flex for a higher-dividend payout to Enbridge shareholders. And that positions us very well for long-term growth and diversification to continued access to low-cost funding.\r\nMoving on now to Slide 20 and the second part of our optimization, which is the revised dividend payout policy. \r\nYou'll recognize this slide as the one I covered at Enbridge Day in early October, which goes through the 4 considerations driving dividend payout policy at Enbridge. First and foremost, is to ensure the funding of our record organic capital program. Again, this is the cake we want to be sure not to jeopardize. You'll see that our new payout policy is tailored to this priority in a minute. Second, we do have significantly increasing internal free cash flow to support a higher payout as investments come into service and our maintenance and integrity capital tapers off, especially in the later years of the 5-year plan. And this issue also plays into our payout design. \r\nThen there's the progress we've already achieved this year on our equity requirement with only $1.9 billion remaining in the 4 years of the plan that we have left. That funding progress gives us very good flexibility to accommodate a higher payout as well. And fourth, there's the strength and position of both the Income Fund and Enbridge Energy Partners. So they now can play a bigger role in terms of contributions to the funding plan. Balancing all of these factors together, we've arrived at a revised policy for our dividend payout depicted on the next couple of slides. The first chart shows our prior policy of paying out 60% to 70% of earnings. That policy was our growth profile generated expected EPS growth of 10% to 12%, essentially, tracking earnings per share growth. We've intentionally been running at the top of this range to be responsive to the market's preference for yield while at the same time, ensuring that we're protecting the funding of the growth program.\r\nThe next slide overlays our revised dividend payout policy of 75% to 85% of earnings. We expect to target the lower end of that range initially that reflects the heaviest growth capital spend years of the plan and before free cash flow hits its full stride. As we move toward the later years of growth plan, we expect to move the payout rate up towards the top end of the range. \r\nSo Slide 22 brings the 2 parts of our financial optimization plan together in terms of the resulting expected dividend growth rate. The first step is the 33% increase for 2015, which we just announced. Following that, we expect a 14% to 16% average annual growth rate in the dividend from 2015 to '18. If you look at this growth relative to our 2013 base here, in fact, our annual DPS CAGR approximately is 18%. Now I'm going to pass the call over to Wanda, who will provide an updated funding plan for the items we just went through as well as some additional color on 2015 guidance. Wanda?\n\n---\n\nThank you, Al. So I'll pick up at Slide 23, which summarizes the impact of the financial optimization on our funding plan using the same format we've been using, but today, we are introducing a second column to contrast the revised plan with the base plan. The base plan is essentially unchanged from the update provided on the third quarter call, except for a small adjustment to the secured and risk growth capital numbers to reflect our recently announced investment in 2 wind farms, and we have now closed the debt offering by the Fund in connection with the 2014 drop down transaction, knocking another $600 million of the remaining debt requirement. \r\nIn the past, we've presented this plan on a basis, which focuses just on Enbridge. We've excluded the Sponsored Investments. But for purposes of the revised plan, we've included the fund's figures to maintain comparability and because we'll be maintaining flexibility to adjust the split of the funding between Enbridge and the fund. So it is a combined funding plan with flexibility to optimize funding across the 2 entities as we go. \r\nIf you look at the top box, you'll see that there's little change down to the subtotal level, just a slight increase to each type of capital as a result of including the capital plan for the fund's legacy assets. Cash flow, net of dividend is lower than in the base plan because of the higher dividend payout associated with the financial optimization. The result is a net $2.2 billion increase in our net external funding requirements for 2014 to 2018. The debt plan, on the left side, remains unchanged. So the full $2.2 billion translates into an increase in the growth equity requirement. Because of the higher dividend payout, you might expect to see the DRIP contribution increase as we go from the base plan to the revised plan. However, we actually are planning to begin to curtail the DRIP in the later years of the revised plan given the expected access to lower cost of funding through the Fund. The bottom part of the equity box sets out how the remaining $4.5 billion of net equity requirement is expected to be met with $3 billion to be raised by Enbridge Income Fund Holdings and $1.5 billion by Enbridge itself, though bearing in mind that we will stay flexible on this split. The $1.5 billion to be raised by Enbridge is very manageable and is expected to be accommodated through additional preferred share issuances over the next 4 years. I'll move in a minute to the 2015 guidance, but first, just a reminder of the 2014 outlook, which is the starting point for 2015. The outlook is unchanged from that which we discussed on the third quarter call. We are expecting to be solidly within the $1.84 to $2.04 per share guidance range, with a couple of headwinds being partially offset by the one tailwind. As we move to our 2015 guidance on Slide 25, the individual segment variances are depicted relative to this 2014 picture. So this slide indicates where the lift in earnings is expected to come from in 2015. The biggest contributor should be Liquids Pipelines, in contrast to 2014 when it provided only a modest lift. \r\nThe big lift expected for 2015 is even after the fact that most of the roughly $50 million of annual earnings from Southern Lights will flow through the Fund in 2015 rather than through Liquids Pipelines as a result of the 2014 drop down. Making up for the absence of Southern Lights and driving the lift for 2015 is the combination of the Mainline, Flanagan South and Seaway. I refer to their combined impact because the 3 are intertwined in our Gulf Coast access program, which is now fully completed. We expect to see a continued increase in mainline volume as we benefit from the elimination of operational limitation and the completion of the second phase of the Alberta Clipper expansion. These additional volumes will generate incremental mainline revenue that will also feed into the contractual obligations on Flanagan South and Seaway. The Mainline will also benefit from the startup of Line 9B in reversed and expanded mode. In addition, the mainline will benefit from a higher Canadian portion of the international joint toll and from surcharges associated with various projects coming into service. \r\nThe Regional Oil Sands System will not be a growth driver for 2015 with increased revenue from new assets offset by one expiring short-term contract, which has not yet been extended or replaced. Gas Distribution is back to making a modest contribution to growth in 2015 after a flat year in 2014. This reflects rate-based growth and incentive earnings under the new customized incentive regulatory framework, plus improved performance at Gas New Brunswick. Gas pipelines, processing and energy services is expected to be flat relative to 2014, but this is a bit misleading with about $50 million of Alliance U.S. income having been transferred to the Fund. Offsetting the absence of Alliance U.S. is an increased contribution from Canadian midstream assets related to the tilted return commercial structure and higher green energy earnings due to an increased asset base. Sponsored Investments has been our biggest growth driver in 2014, and should be a big contributor again in 2015. This is partly a result of various phases of the U.S. Eastern Access expansion and Mainline expansion, which are in service for all of 2015. It is also a result of the transfer of the Alliance U.S. and Southern Light's interest to the fund. Lastly, it's corporate, which is expected to be relatively flat year-over-year. Additional external funding costs, including preferred share dividends should be roughly offset by additional allocation of these expenses to the business unit. These next 2 slides provide details on the projects and growth capital that will build on the earnings growth momentum next year and into 2016. This slide captures the $8 billion worth of projects that we're expecting to bring into service in 2015. I won't go through the entire list. But as you can see, the projects are spread across a number of areas, including Liquids Pipelines, Gas Pipelines, Gas Distribution and power generation. Within Liquids Pipelines, we're excited to be closing out several other major market access initiative, which will provide our shippers with the much needed capacity and greater flexibility. In total, our market access program will open up 1.7 million barrels per day of incremental market access capacity. \r\nSlide 27 provides further details around our expectations on 2015 capital in-service by quarter to help you get a better feel for when these assets are expected to contribute to earnings and cash flow. With that, I'll turn it back to over to Al for some closing remarks.\n\n---\n\nOkay, thanks, Wanda. I'll close off and with some high-level takeaways. Slide 28 illustrates our EPS growth outlook, assuming the drop down proceeds as we've laid out here today. The plan would further support our industry-leading growth rate with a 10% uplift in the entire profile for 2015 through 2018. Now we haven't modeled the structure beyond that, but in concept, we'd continue to capitalize on the low-cost funding through EIFH. As always, the goal would be to enhance our competitiveness in securing new organic acquisition opportunities, thereby supplementing our growth beyond 2018. So you can see that what we're doing is adding one more arrow in the quiver that will extend our industry-leading growth well beyond 2018. \r\nSlide 29 now. Previous to our announcement, we expected 10% to 12% dividend per share CAGR. You see here in the blue area, the new DPS growth picture is even stronger, with an initial 33% boost for 2015 and 14% to 16% in the years following through 2018. The new dividend picture reflects the underlying strength of our assets and growth profile. Post 2018, the drop structure will position us well to deliver continued growth. I'm turning now to the last slide on 30. \r\nTo summarize all of this today, this financial structure and strategy optimization should provide a number of benefits over and above our already very strong base strategic plan. Most obvious is that we'll be nicely accretive to EPS and dividend per share growth through 2018 with a significant initial dividend increase and higher future growth and dividends through 2018. Importantly, we're transforming Enbridge Income Fund to a high-growth vehicle, which will further improve its cost to funding and enhance the value of our $44 billion growth capital program. Our strategies, approach to the business and our priorities will remain exactly as they are today, but the optimization should enhance asset acquisition opportunities. Finally, the new structure will position us very well to support further investment and growth in all of our businesses beyond 2018. \r\nSo with that, we'll turn it over to the operator to open up the Q&A session.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Adam McKnight (Executives)】\nThank you, Christine. Good morning, and welcome to Enbridge Inc.'s 2015 Guidance and Investment Community Update Call. With me this morning are Al Monaco, President and CEO; Richard Bird, Executive Vice President, Corporate Development; Wanda Opheim, Senior Vice President, Finance; Guy Jarvis, President, Liquids Pipeline; and Leigh Kelln, Vice President, Investor Relations and Enterprise Risk. This call is webcast, and I encourage those listening on the phone lines to view the supporting slides, which are available on our website. A replay and podcast of the call will be available later today, and a transcript will be posted to our website shortly thereafter. The Q&A format will be the same as always. We'll take questions from the analyst community first and then invite questions from the media. I would also remind you that Leigh and I will be available after the call for any follow-up questions that you might have.\r\nBefore we begin, I'd like to point out that we will refer to forward-looking information in connection with Enbridge and the subject matter of today's call. By its nature, this information contains forecasts, assumptions and expectations about future outcomes, so we remind you it is subject to the risks and uncertainties affecting every business, including ours. This slide include the summary of the significant factors and risks that could affect future outcomes for Enbridge, which are also discussed more fully in our public disclosure filings available on both the SEDAR and Edgar systems. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Al Monaco.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Al Monaco (Executives)】\nGood morning, everyone. Today, we'll be elaborating on the news release we issued yesterday after market. It's something we're excited about, so thank you for joining us today. \r\nI'm going to start with our 2015 earnings per share guidance, which is the normal course part of the call at this time of the year for us. I'll then provide the overarching strategic context and objective of the change we're planning to our financial structure. Then I'll expand on both the Canadian restructuring plan and the revised dividend payout policy, which has been approved by our board. Wanda Opheim will update related changes to the funding waterfall from what I just talked about and provide more color on the 2015 EPS guidance. By the way, our CFO, John Wheeling, is unable to be here today due to illness. I'll come back with some takeaways after Wanda's discussion, and then we'll open it up for questions. \r\nBy the way, because of what we will be covering today, we're going to be using a fair number of acronyms. So if at all possible, it will be good if you could follow along with the slides, if you can. \r\nTurning now to Slide 4. We expect our 2015 EPS to be between $2.05 to $2.35 per share. That's ahead of 2014 growth as we pick up the full year benefit of new projects coming into service this year and part of the year for those slated to be completed in 2015. The range that we have here excludes the partial year impact we'd expect from the plant drop down, which I'll come to shortly.\r\nThe guidance is in line with our expected long-term average annual growth rate of 10% to 12% in EPS. So all-in strong growth expected for next year, and Wanda will get into more of that later on. \r\nOnto Slide 5. Before we get to the drop down, I'd like to provide some broader strategic context. Many of you will recognize this graphic we have here from comments that we made at Enbridge Day. \r\nFirst, there'll be no change to our business strategy and our priorities. We have a strong 5-year plan. Earnings and dividend growth are driven by our $44 billion record growth capital program that will require a focus on execution and funding, and both of those, we believe, are progressing very well. Our sponsored vehicles are positioned to support the strategic plan, and for the Income Fund, we're now articulating a very explicit plan for how it will be involved. And we have a longer-term strategy rebouncing our asset mix through increased investment in natural gas and power infrastructure, which our revised financial structure will give us better tools to make that happen over time. The key point of all this is that the changes we're planning to our financial structure are designed to generate even greater value from our existing business plan. All that said, our first and most important priority, as always, is safe and reliable operation of our systems, and optimizing the financial structure will also benefit our customers through lower practical infrastructure services cost that we provide. That's even more important given the volatile oil price environment our industry is facing today.\r\nSlide 6 is a reminder the value drivers underpinning that strategic plan. The first is the $44 billion capital program, I just referred to, that generates 10% to 12% annual EPS growth through 2018 on average and provides a strong contribution beyond 2018 as well. This growth is very visible with 3/4 of the capital outlook being commercially secured. That's the blue part of those bars. And this capital and these projects will deliver strong risk-adjusted returns. Executing this capital program is the priority, so you can think of this as the cake, part of the icing and the cake. \r\nOnto Slide 7. The other main value driver here is that the earnings and cash flow from the program are highly visible because of our reliable business model and conservative financial management. That's backed up by our track record of delivering on what we guide to, both on an annual and long-term basis, as you see in the chart here, and you can also see that dividend growth has nicely tracked EPS growth. So this is part of the cake as well and that's where most of the value will come from, so we'll continue to ensure we're baking that cake with the right care and attention. \r\nNow let's move on to how we plan to optimize the base plan, and this is the icing on the cake. \r\nSlide 8 is a high-level overview of what our optimization plan involves and what's it intended to accomplish. There are 2 parts to this, and they work in tandem. The first part is a large scale drop down from Enbridge to Enbridge Income Fund or EIF. EIF is a majority owned by Enbridge and has public ownership as well through Enbridge Income Fund Holdings. I'll refer to that later as EIFH. This concept isn't new to us, and it's similar to the drop downs we've been doing but it's much bigger because it involves all of our Canadian Liquids Pipelines assets and some renewable assets as well. I'll come back to provide you a bit more on how this will work. \r\nNow the second part is a change our dividend payout policy from 60% to 70% of earnings to a 75% to 85% range, which we are now in good position to do. Together, these 2 changes generate increased value for both Enbridge and Enbridge Income Fund Holdings in 4 ways: accelerated earnings and dividend growth, enhanced competitiveness through a reduced cost of capital, transforming Enbridge Income Fund to a higher-growth vehicle and reinforcing growth beyond 2018. So the goal overall is to enhance the value of our existing plan both for Enbridge and the Fund. So let's go through in a bit more detail now on the first part of the optimization.\r\nSlide 9 is an overview of the proposed drop down plan. Basically, we're looking at transferring assets with the book value of $17 billion plus another $15 billion of associated secured growth capital. In our math, we're assuming an EBITDA multiple in the low to mid-teens but ultimately the valuation will be considered by a special committee of Enbridge Income Fund, and of course, our own Enbridge Board. Valuations, a little bit higher than in previous drop downs but these assets have a lot more built-in growth. That includes the embedded growth and the tilted returns on a good chunk of the secured capital that you saw earlier, which we talked about in the past. So in that range of pricing, the drop down will be accretive to both Enbridge and EIFH. Part of that comes through Enbridge's 25% incentive distribution rate in the Fund. \r\nThe plan is to provide a formal offer to EIF in the first quarter of 2015 or thereabouts, with a targeted closing by mid-2015. \r\nGiven the size of the drop down, Enbridge would take back a significant amount of EIF units as consideration. So we'd initially have about a 90% economic interest in the Fund at closing, which will be whittled down over time, and I'll come back to that as well. \r\nSlide 10 is a simplified picture of our current structure with the Canadian Liquids Pipelines assets held by Enbridge Pipelines Inc., that is EPI, and Enbridge Pipelines Athabasca, EPA. So now we're fully into the acronyms I referred to earlier. The transaction will involve the tax-free drop down of both EPI and EPA into Enbridge Income Fund. EPI also holds some renewable assets, which will also move to Enbridge Income Fund with the Liquids Pipelines assets. You'll notice EPI also holds Enbridge Energy Partners, but that will stay with Enbridge. \r\nSo now that we've got those acronyms down, moving to Slide 11. It shows how things will look after the drop down. As you can see, EPI and EPA would be held by Enbridge Income Fund or EIF. Enbridge would directly hold about 88% in EIF or about 90% economic interest when you include our ownership through our investment in EIFH. Enbridge would still control EIF where the assets would be held, and there will be no change to the operations or the strategic development of the business. \r\nI'll go through the assets included now on the next 3 slides. I'll go through these quickly as most people are quite familiar with these. \r\nSide 12 shows the Canadian Mainline assets. The biggest component is the Canadian portion of our mainline Western Canada to U.S. Midwest conduit. That's the largest and most complex crude oil system in the world. And by the way, the U.S. portion of the mainline is held through Enbridge Energy Partners or U.S. MLP. So this group of assets, of $10 billion on Enbridge's books, with an associated secured growth capital program of $9 billion. \r\nSlide 13 shows the component of our oil sands regional system. Not as big as the mainline system but still a substantial size, $6 billion of assets, and an associated secured growth program of another $6 billion. \r\nAnd Slide 14 shows the 4 wind projects that would be included in the transfer, about $1 billion of assets. So in summarizing this part, when you add all of these up, it represents a transaction of about $17 billion in assets and $15 billion in secured growth investments, and obviously, that's on a book basis or the cost of new projects.\r\nTurning now to Slide 15. As I referred to earlier, this planned drop down differs from the others we've done because of its size, and that means it's too big for EIFH to take in one bite. \r\nThat's due to the relative size of the EIFH's public float even though that's been growing in recent years. So EIFH's investment in the Fund will be staged over several years, but the drop will certainly provide it with a massive growth engine. \r\nAt this point, we expect EIFH's annual equity raise to be in the range of $600 million to $800 million. Enbridge will maintain its approximate 20% interest in EIFH as well, so investing another $150 million to $200 million annually. Importantly, Enbridge will invest an additional equity directly in EIF of about $1.5 billion over the next 3 to 4 years. So the point is, we'll remain focused on funding of the organic program. \r\nAs EIFH continues to invest in EIF, its ownership will rise and Enbridge will decline from about 90% on execution to around 80% by 2018. Relative to our previous ad hoc approach to drop downs, the beauty about this structure is that Enbridge will have a permanent and effective avenue to release capital beyond 2018. And as we've shown in the past, we expect to have attractive opportunities to deploy that capital.\r\nNow onto Slide 16. A very important outcome of this plan is the transformation of EIFH into a high-dividend growth vehicle. Here is why that happens. Historically, the payout policy of EIF and EIFH has been managed to provide a smooth 1% growth in distributions. That's how it was originally designed. In actual fact, the 1% growth has been supplemented in most years by some organic growth in the assets or periodic drops. I think that's generated good value for unitholders, but to be fair, that approach has been less than predictable from an investor's perspective. Going forward, we have a transparent plan and a large inventory assets for EIFH to invest a significant amount of capital every year. \r\nWe expect this will provide dependable growth in dividends for EIFH of about 10% on average for 2015 through 2018. That growth would come about from an increasing investment in the assets but also participation in the upward-tilted cash flow stream from the new assets. So clearly, a great opportunity for EIFH. \r\nNow let's look at this from Enbridge's Inc.'s perspective. Slide 17 illustrates one of the big benefits to Enbridge EPS accretion from the drop. The ultimate picture will depend, of course, on the definitive terms of the drop down, which will have to be agreed to by a committee of EIF directors. Based on our assumptions, we anticipate an uplift in Enbridge EPS of about 10% on an annualized basis in the first full year following execution. The chart here shows the annualized effect in 2015. The accretion grows thereafter at about the same rate as the base 10% to 12% EPS rates. So each subsequent year is uplifted by about the same 10% through to and including 2018. So that's the financial outlook from the drop. Now let's have a look at what changes on how growth is funded going forward. \r\nFirst, I think it's important to note that Enbridge will continue to coordinate the integrated development of the investment opportunities across the entire asset base as we do today. In terms of Slide 18, it lays out the types of infrastructure investments that will be funded by each of our sponsored vehicles and those funded by Enbridge. So the only change you see here in red is the primary source of equity funding for 2 of the investment opportunity types. For Canadian Liquids Pipelines development, we'll now look to EIFH as a primary source of equity funding in the same way that EEP is the primary source of the U.S. Liquids funding opportunities. Enbridge will be prepared to continue to fund any part of that, which EIFH couldn't raise on favorable terms. This is exactly what we do with our U.S. assets. \r\nEnbridge continues to fund gas pipeline development, Canadian midstream, gas distribution and new growth platforms like power and international. \r\nWe're onto Slide 19 now. Before we get to the second part of the optimization plan, I'll recap the benefits we see from the drop down part. The most obvious and quantifiable benefit is the higher EPS and dividend per share growth through 2018. The drop down would also capitalize on EIFH's ability to raise equity as a low-cost source of funding for our organic growth program, that will also provide more flex for a higher-dividend payout to Enbridge shareholders. And that positions us very well for long-term growth and diversification to continued access to low-cost funding.\r\nMoving on now to Slide 20 and the second part of our optimization, which is the revised dividend payout policy. \r\nYou'll recognize this slide as the one I covered at Enbridge Day in early October, which goes through the 4 considerations driving dividend payout policy at Enbridge. First and foremost, is to ensure the funding of our record organic capital program. Again, this is the cake we want to be sure not to jeopardize. You'll see that our new payout policy is tailored to this priority in a minute. Second, we do have significantly increasing internal free cash flow to support a higher payout as investments come into service and our maintenance and integrity capital tapers off, especially in the later years of the 5-year plan. And this issue also plays into our payout design. \r\nThen there's the progress we've already achieved this year on our equity requirement with only $1.9 billion remaining in the 4 years of the plan that we have left. That funding progress gives us very good flexibility to accommodate a higher payout as well. And fourth, there's the strength and position of both the Income Fund and Enbridge Energy Partners. So they now can play a bigger role in terms of contributions to the funding plan. Balancing all of these factors together, we've arrived at a revised policy for our dividend payout depicted on the next couple of slides. The first chart shows our prior policy of paying out 60% to 70% of earnings. That policy was our growth profile generated expected EPS growth of 10% to 12%, essentially, tracking earnings per share growth. We've intentionally been running at the top of this range to be responsive to the market's preference for yield while at the same time, ensuring that we're protecting the funding of the growth program.\r\nThe next slide overlays our revised dividend payout policy of 75% to 85% of earnings. We expect to target the lower end of that range initially that reflects the heaviest growth capital spend years of the plan and before free cash flow hits its full stride. As we move toward the later years of growth plan, we expect to move the payout rate up towards the top end of the range. \r\nSo Slide 22 brings the 2 parts of our financial optimization plan together in terms of the resulting expected dividend growth rate. The first step is the 33% increase for 2015, which we just announced. Following that, we expect a 14% to 16% average annual growth rate in the dividend from 2015 to '18. If you look at this growth relative to our 2013 base here, in fact, our annual DPS CAGR approximately is 18%. Now I'm going to pass the call over to Wanda, who will provide an updated funding plan for the items we just went through as well as some additional color on 2015 guidance. Wanda?\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: W. Opheim (Executives)】\nThank you, Al. So I'll pick up at Slide 23, which summarizes the impact of the financial optimization on our funding plan using the same format we've been using, but today, we are introducing a second column to contrast the revised plan with the base plan. The base plan is essentially unchanged from the update provided on the third quarter call, except for a small adjustment to the secured and risk growth capital numbers to reflect our recently announced investment in 2 wind farms, and we have now closed the debt offering by the Fund in connection with the 2014 drop down transaction, knocking another $600 million of the remaining debt requirement. \r\nIn the past, we've presented this plan on a basis, which focuses just on Enbridge. We've excluded the Sponsored Investments. But for purposes of the revised plan, we've included the fund's figures to maintain comparability and because we'll be maintaining flexibility to adjust the split of the funding between Enbridge and the fund. So it is a combined funding plan with flexibility to optimize funding across the 2 entities as we go. \r\nIf you look at the top box, you'll see that there's little change down to the subtotal level, just a slight increase to each type of capital as a result of including the capital plan for the fund's legacy assets. Cash flow, net of dividend is lower than in the base plan because of the higher dividend payout associated with the financial optimization. The result is a net $2.2 billion increase in our net external funding requirements for 2014 to 2018. The debt plan, on the left side, remains unchanged. So the full $2.2 billion translates into an increase in the growth equity requirement. Because of the higher dividend payout, you might expect to see the DRIP contribution increase as we go from the base plan to the revised plan. However, we actually are planning to begin to curtail the DRIP in the later years of the revised plan given the expected access to lower cost of funding through the Fund. The bottom part of the equity box sets out how the remaining $4.5 billion of net equity requirement is expected to be met with $3 billion to be raised by Enbridge Income Fund Holdings and $1.5 billion by Enbridge itself, though bearing in mind that we will stay flexible on this split. The $1.5 billion to be raised by Enbridge is very manageable and is expected to be accommodated through additional preferred share issuances over the next 4 years. I'll move in a minute to the 2015 guidance, but first, just a reminder of the 2014 outlook, which is the starting point for 2015. The outlook is unchanged from that which we discussed on the third quarter call. We are expecting to be solidly within the $1.84 to $2.04 per share guidance range, with a couple of headwinds being partially offset by the one tailwind. As we move to our 2015 guidance on Slide 25, the individual segment variances are depicted relative to this 2014 picture. So this slide indicates where the lift in earnings is expected to come from in 2015. The biggest contributor should be Liquids Pipelines, in contrast to 2014 when it provided only a modest lift. \r\nThe big lift expected for 2015 is even after the fact that most of the roughly $50 million of annual earnings from Southern Lights will flow through the Fund in 2015 rather than through Liquids Pipelines as a result of the 2014 drop down. Making up for the absence of Southern Lights and driving the lift for 2015 is the combination of the Mainline, Flanagan South and Seaway. I refer to their combined impact because the 3 are intertwined in our Gulf Coast access program, which is now fully completed. We expect to see a continued increase in mainline volume as we benefit from the elimination of operational limitation and the completion of the second phase of the Alberta Clipper expansion. These additional volumes will generate incremental mainline revenue that will also feed into the contractual obligations on Flanagan South and Seaway. The Mainline will also benefit from the startup of Line 9B in reversed and expanded mode. In addition, the mainline will benefit from a higher Canadian portion of the international joint toll and from surcharges associated with various projects coming into service. \r\nThe Regional Oil Sands System will not be a growth driver for 2015 with increased revenue from new assets offset by one expiring short-term contract, which has not yet been extended or replaced. Gas Distribution is back to making a modest contribution to growth in 2015 after a flat year in 2014. This reflects rate-based growth and incentive earnings under the new customized incentive regulatory framework, plus improved performance at Gas New Brunswick. Gas pipelines, processing and energy services is expected to be flat relative to 2014, but this is a bit misleading with about $50 million of Alliance U.S. income having been transferred to the Fund. Offsetting the absence of Alliance U.S. is an increased contribution from Canadian midstream assets related to the tilted return commercial structure and higher green energy earnings due to an increased asset base. Sponsored Investments has been our biggest growth driver in 2014, and should be a big contributor again in 2015. This is partly a result of various phases of the U.S. Eastern Access expansion and Mainline expansion, which are in service for all of 2015. It is also a result of the transfer of the Alliance U.S. and Southern Light's interest to the fund. Lastly, it's corporate, which is expected to be relatively flat year-over-year. Additional external funding costs, including preferred share dividends should be roughly offset by additional allocation of these expenses to the business unit. These next 2 slides provide details on the projects and growth capital that will build on the earnings growth momentum next year and into 2016. This slide captures the $8 billion worth of projects that we're expecting to bring into service in 2015. I won't go through the entire list. But as you can see, the projects are spread across a number of areas, including Liquids Pipelines, Gas Pipelines, Gas Distribution and power generation. Within Liquids Pipelines, we're excited to be closing out several other major market access initiative, which will provide our shippers with the much needed capacity and greater flexibility. In total, our market access program will open up 1.7 million barrels per day of incremental market access capacity. \r\nSlide 27 provides further details around our expectations on 2015 capital in-service by quarter to help you get a better feel for when these assets are expected to contribute to earnings and cash flow. With that, I'll turn it back to over to Al for some closing remarks.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Al Monaco (Executives)】\nOkay, thanks, Wanda. I'll close off and with some high-level takeaways. Slide 28 illustrates our EPS growth outlook, assuming the drop down proceeds as we've laid out here today. The plan would further support our industry-leading growth rate with a 10% uplift in the entire profile for 2015 through 2018. Now we haven't modeled the structure beyond that, but in concept, we'd continue to capitalize on the low-cost funding through EIFH. As always, the goal would be to enhance our competitiveness in securing new organic acquisition opportunities, thereby supplementing our growth beyond 2018. So you can see that what we're doing is adding one more arrow in the quiver that will extend our industry-leading growth well beyond 2018. \r\nSlide 29 now. Previous to our announcement, we expected 10% to 12% dividend per share CAGR. You see here in the blue area, the new DPS growth picture is even stronger, with an initial 33% boost for 2015 and 14% to 16% in the years following through 2018. The new dividend picture reflects the underlying strength of our assets and growth profile. Post 2018, the drop structure will position us well to deliver continued growth. I'm turning now to the last slide on 30. \r\nTo summarize all of this today, this financial structure and strategy optimization should provide a number of benefits over and above our already very strong base strategic plan. Most obvious is that we'll be nicely accretive to EPS and dividend per share growth through 2018 with a significant initial dividend increase and higher future growth and dividends through 2018. Importantly, we're transforming Enbridge Income Fund to a high-growth vehicle, which will further improve its cost to funding and enhance the value of our $44 billion growth capital program. Our strategies, approach to the business and our priorities will remain exactly as they are today, but the optimization should enhance asset acquisition opportunities. Finally, the new structure will position us very well to support further investment and growth in all of our businesses beyond 2018. \r\nSo with that, we'll turn it over to the operator to open up the Q&A session.",
      "transcript_text3": "I have some questions about the associated EBITDA and maintenance capital and cash taxes on your $17 billion of identified Canadian assets as well as the $15 billion of growth CapEx. If you can help us out with that, that would be very helpful.\n\n---\n\nLinda, I don't think we're going to go through the details here on the call. I think the number that we can provide now related to the assets we're dropping down is in the order of $2 billion. So obviously, we'll be working through the rest of the numbers as we evaluate the transaction with the Enbridge Income Fund. So that's where we are at the moment on that.\n\n---\n\nSorry, EBITDA of $2 billion?\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nAnd maintenance capital?\n\n---\n\nI'm sorry, we don't have the associated maintenance capital right now. But I guess maybe -- unless Wanda, you have that figure with you?\n\n---\n\nNo.\n\n---\n\nYes. So we will have to get back on that. We don't have that detail at the moment.\n\n---\n\nOkay, and can we also get at some point some sense of cash taxes, especially at the Enbridge Income Fund and Enbridge Income Fund Holdings level that has been sometimes quite volatile year-to-year. So some guidance over the next number of years will be very helpful as well.\n\n---\n\nYes. We will plan to do that as we move forward with the transaction.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And just a clean-up question. Can you just confirm that there's going to be no delta to the incentive split for Enbridge from either on Enbridge Income Fund or EEP at any point?\n\n---\n\nWe can confirm that. There's no change anticipated there.\n\n---\n\nI'm wondering where you've taken the payout ratio now as you think about additional drop down potentially to EEP and whatnot? Where could that payout ratio ultimately go, if you are successful with that step of the structuring?\n\n---\n\nWell, I think as we've discussed there, Ted, the payout ratio has been designed specifically to account for the capital profile that we have and the growth capital as we've talked about earlier. So we're moving from 75% -- we'll have a range of 75% to 85%. And the payout itself will match that over time moving from the lower end of that to the higher end through the next few years. So at this point, that's the policy that we've come to and that's what we expect for at least the next 3 to 4 years.\n\n---\n\nOkay.\n\n---\n\nObviously, with -- sorry, just to add on there. Obviously, with the cash flow that we have and our ability to access additional funding through EIFH, that could change. But at this point, that's the policy.\n\n---\n\nGot it. And then again, as you think about EEP, the 13x to 15x multiple on the drop downs that you're talking about today, does that seem like the appropriate multiple to EEP? Or how do you think through the accretion dilution for them?\n\n---\n\nYes. Well, that -- as you know, that multiple will depend on a number of things. For EEP, importantly, it's been a bit of a different situation there. The valuation and its currency hasn't been as strong for a number of reasons. So really, the multiple that we think of in terms of EEP will be just be dependent on the growth outlook, the ability for EEP to pay a sufficient price to Enbridge for the assets, so that will be determined as we move forward.\n\n---\n\nGot it.\r\n[Audio Gap]\r\nhere with a higher dividend payout that you're seeing less on the organic growth opportunities maybe in the out years of the plan or if you look with the lower commodity price environment? Is that something that we're implicitly signaling with this? Or is that still expected to be where it's been?\n\n---\n\nNo, I would say it's actually the opposite, Ted. We're very encouraged by what we see in terms of organic opportunities. More generally, the opportunities that North America is very strong for energy infrastructure, we don't see that abating anytime soon, at all. With respect to the dividend payout itself, as we've said, we've been pretty conservative in our approach. We've been waiting through the last couple of years to ensure that we've got a lot of the funding locked down. I think we've been very successful raising about $16 billion in the last couple of years to ensure the funding of the capital program. We've made very good progress. The cash flow -- free cash flow is expected to increase in the next 3 or 4 years as we've explained, so we think this is the right time to increase the dividend payout. So I would say, it's not driven by our organic growth outlook at all.\n\n---\n\nI'm just wondering if the credit rating agencies have had a view of this? And whether their -- so we can change, I think, from one of the rating agencies replacing Enbridge on a negative outlook. Whether that was in contemplation of this transaction or if they were unaware of what you're suggesting now?\n\n---\n\nWanda?\n\n---\n\nYes. We did review this transaction with the rating agencies. So they are aware of it. They have all -- they are all in the process of putting out reports this morning. S&P had applied a negative outlook to Enbridge in advance of this transaction and the reports this morning we are seeing Moody's has put out a report and DBRS, and they are both have put Enbridge on a negative outlook or looking at under developing -- under a developing on the outlook. It should be noted that for Enbridge Income Fund, this is a very positive transaction, so we should see a rating. And for Enbridge, there are steps we were taking to manage the transaction for our debt holders with the debt exchange that we mentioned in the press release that we are contemplating.\n\n---\n\nI think, may be, I'll just add on another comment to what Wanda said. We don't believe, there's going to be a reduction in credit strength here to Enbridge. In fact, if you look at it from an Enbridge Inc.'s debt holder perspective, they're going to still have access to the diversified cash flow of this business. The offering that we'll make in terms of exchanging potentially into EIF debt will be hopeful, we believe. And the bottom line is that from a consolidated point of view, the leverage here doesn't change. So we think, we're going to maintain our financial strength overall.\n\n---\n\nOkay. If I can have one more question. I'm just wondering around the tilted returns and the volume benefits on the mainline from the CPS agreement over time. How should we think about the $2 billion EBITDA number that you mentioned on the assets being dropped down? What does that grow to under your calculations over time from the tilted returns and the volume benefits on the mainline? And does dropping these assets down impact Enbridge's growth in the out years won't be getting the direct benefits anymore from those tilted returns and the volume growth?\n\n---\n\nOkay. I'll start, and then I'll hand it to Richard for any further information. First of all, Enbridge will continue to participate in the growth of the assets and in particular, the tilted returns through its investment in EIF. So that's not going to change. It's going to held a little bit differently. There is -- there will also be some elements, we're sure that when we get through the details of the discussions with the Enbridge Income Fund special committee that will be reflected in the terms of the drop down, that will allow us to ensure we're capturing the right amount of growth for Enbridge Inc. So those are my comments on that. Richard, do you have anything to add?\n\n---\n\nI think that pretty well covers it. And of course, the incentive mechanism that's built into the income fund structure provides a tool for appropriately capturing the benefits of those tilted returns as we move further into the future. But the details of that transaction will come out of the negotiations with the special committee over the course of the early part of next year. So that's about what we have for now.\n\n---\n\nAl, you might have answered this in some way just by saying that you think the financial strength and the credit quality hasn't changed, but I'm just wondering, are you going to be explicitly managing to a specific credit rating at the ENB level? And I guess, specifically, the plan to fund the \"equity\" $1.5 billion via preferred, and I assume that's $3 billion than of notional value, does that potentially move around depending how the rating agencies fall? And I guess you've got the wiggle room here with almost $0.5 billion of the trip that Wanda mentioned you expect to curtail?\n\n---\n\nWell, let me see. And the first part is to managing to a credit rating. First of all, as we said, we don't really see any reduction in the credit strength of our entities. In fact, as Wanda pointed out in terms of the income fund, it strengthens further, I would say. We're going to have to wait and see what the rating agencies say. Certainly, they're going to be looking at this transaction, and we'll just wait for what they say. In terms of the preferred equity, Wanda, do you have a comment on that?\n\n---\n\nYes. Robert, you're correct. That's what it would translate into, under the criteria into the -- into $3 billion, and we'll look at our options on preferred shares through the period, as well as other hybrid instruments that we could consider. And as Al mentioned, we will continue to work with the agencies. That's what we're planning to do over the next period as we provide them with more information, and they can get more comfortable with what this transaction means as because as Al indicated, we do feel that credit strength of the company has been maintained, and we're not introducing any incremental leverage.\n\n---\n\nRight. I guess, maybe just putting it differently. If the market for both your bonds and preferreds kind of takes your view that the credit strength hasn't changed, and therefore, the pricing doesn't materially change. Are you then really that fast at the rating agencies go to, say, BBB, BAA 2? Are you really going to take the queue from the market, I guess, is the question?\n\n---\n\nGo ahead.\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And just one last question. How sensitive is the EPS accretion and your funding plan, and the future EPS growth to the share price/valuation of Enbridge Income Fund as it tries to fill that $600 million to $800 million equity cap?\n\n---\n\nWell, the whole premise here, of course, is that we're capturing the value of Enbridge's -- Enbridge Income Fund's ability to raise capital at effective prices. So obviously, the arbitrage between the 2 needs to be maintained in order to be effective. We referenced earlier, there's a number of factors that go into that, including the IDR mechanism that Enbridge retains and there's an element of growth there so I -- we can't get specific as to what the sensitivities are per each change in Enbridge Income Fund dollar value share price. But suffice to say that this does depend on the efficiency of capturing that valuation arbitrage between the 2.\n\n---\n\nOkay, Al, maybe I could just add into that, that in the math that's run out here in terms of the guidance on the impact of the transaction, we obviously have assumed some enhancements in the value of the fund that would be difficult to imagine the fund not picking up some value as a result of this drop down transaction, but pretty conservative view of that value enhancements, what's baked into the numbers at the moment certainly relative to what we and our financial advisers think could be the outcome. So -- and I think, it's pretty solid the way it's been portrayed here.\n\n---\n\nMaybe we can continue with the cake analogy and just on the icing. So the structure that you proposed last night, and the stock market reaction is weren't obviously very positive. But I guess, do you think about this as the genesis of this is really the valuation delta you see in the market? And then, I guess, the cake analogy comes in with -- this is obviously pretty pain staking what you've done, but the flavor might not be for everybody. And so is this along the lines of an icing front of versus more popular butter cream kind of icing that you used to be?\n\n---\n\nWell, I don't even know what those mean. But I'll try and answer your question. As I said, the way we're looking at this is we have a very strong base plan previous to this change in payout policy and previous to the drop down announcement. And -- but the reality is that in order for us to be competitive, we need to be ensuring that our valuation is maximized. So we're looking to the icing here to whatever kind of icing you want to describe it as really boosting or maximizing the value of what is already a very good plan. And it's our job to do that, and we think that this structure and combination with the dividend payout will hopefully be reflected in the marketplace as we think it will. Richard?\n\n---\n\nSo I guess, just to follow-up...\n\n---\n\nIt's Richard, and maybe I'll just add to that cake and icing part of the discussion. So the cake, I think, management has always felt is a very strong cake. And one of the frustrations perhaps that might have been apparent in some perspectives we've provided in the past, including Enbridge Days, is we never really felt the market was fully capturing the value of that cake in the market valuation. So the way we look at it, this overall approach both enhances the underlying value by reducing the cost of funding, and we're always trying to maximize that spread between the return on the assets and the cost of funding the assets. But hopefully, also gives rise to a little better recognition in the market of how good the cake always has been.\n\n---\n\nOkay, that's very helpful. And then with the future proposed structure, do you foresee a potential for some kind of holding company discount to be applied on an Enbridge level is the ownership levels of the underlying and especially ENF will be quite high. And so that's something you haven't really had to deal with or addressed before is even though the ownership levels were high, the overall asset value relative to Enbridge Inc. wasn't tremendous and now that equation is changing a bit. So do you foresee that kind of problem happening in the future?\n\n---\n\nYes. Andrew, it's Al. The short answer is, no, and that's for a couple of reasons. The first reason is that when we look at the fundamental value of the cash flows, and this is where Richard was going, we actually see a discount already in the marketplace and part of what we're trying to do here is close that gap. I would say that secondly, when you think of holding company discounts in the traditional sense, they're usually in cases where the vehicles beneath the holding company are different types of businesses, different types of industries, and in our case, we have a very homogenous asset grouping. It's either liquids pipelines or gas pipelines or something awfully, awfully similar. So, no, we don't see that as a problem, and hopefully, the discount that we're seeing today will be closed up.\n\n---\n\nI was wondering if you could discuss how this restructuring really affects your capital deployment criteria, notwithstanding, if we ignore from it and the reaction and the share price? But how you approach evaluating your acquisition criteria? And related to that, is there any increased capacity to make acquisitions at the Enbridge Inc. level understanding and, of course, you're going to look at your acquisition and leverage metrics on a consolidated basis?\n\n---\n\nOkay. That's a good question, Rob. Well, first of all, as to how we evaluate investments, frankly, I don't think that is going to change. I mean, at the end of the day, there's all kinds of metrics that we use out there, but we have always looked at future cash flows and the appropriate discount rate to apply to those cash flows as our main criteria. And we're very careful about ensuring that we apply the right discount rate through identifying risks and making sure we can mitigate those risks. So typically, we've tried to ensure that we have a very good spread between what we see as a return on the project versus what we think the true cost of equity capital is for that particular asset that we're looking in. So I would say, it doesn't really change our overall point of view on how we evaluate investments from what we've done here. Obviously, of course, with an improved valuation, which we're hoping to get, that would help to reduce our overall cost of capital. So there's certainly -- is that upside. With respect to acquisitions, I think, you're right, improved valuation will certainly help that. But as I said earlier on, the basic approach and strategies to the business is not going to change. So we may have a better currency, we hope, and that will certainly give us more opportunity to affect some of the things we've been talking about around increasing the footprint and potentially more natural gas opportunities, but that will remain to be seen based on the quality of what we see out there.\n\n---\n\nOkay. I understand where you're going with that. But I wondered if though, in your strategy and if your advisers have indicated there's an increased capacity notwithstanding, you may have a better currency. Do you actually have more capacity to go out at the Enbridge Inc. level and maybe make strategic investments. And similar to that, in the past, you've been reluctant, I guess, to dilute the growth rate of the company through strategic investments that maybe aren't as accretive in the short-term, and with your higher dividend and EPS growth rate now under the structure, does your appetite undertake maybe a growth dilutive acquisition or investment change?\n\n---\n\nOkay, okay. So the first part of your question around capacity. I think there will be more capacity. If you look at the Enbridge Income Fund and potentially even Enbridge Energy Partners down the road, the fact that they can raise capital effectively will certainly provide us more flexibility going forward as they will be funding a good portion of the growth that we'll be talking about here. On the second part, the strategic investments, I think, you said, we may have been reluctant. I'm not sure, I would put it in those terms. In our case, we've had such a fantastic organic program in front of us that's what we've focused on. We have made strategic investments as Seaway was a good one and we capitalized on that one very quickly when we saw the opportunity. So I wouldn't say we're hesitant. I think I would still categorize what we'll do in the future is still a very disciplined approach. As I said, we maybe have a bit more flex with an improved valuation. And -- but as I said, we'll have to see what opportunities arise, and whether or not we want to use that currency.\n\n---\n\nJust a couple of clean-up questions. First on the $2 billion EBITDA, is that a 2015 number? Or what is that?\n\n---\n\nYes, yes, it's 2015.\n\n---\n\nOkay, perfect. And then secondly, with respect to the -- I'll call it the IDR with EIF or -- is that going to remain flat at 25%? Or are you contemplating something else?\n\n---\n\nNo, we're not contemplating any change there, David.\n\n---\n\nOkay, perfect. And then finally, in terms of the plan, is the -- what is the percentage debt sort of capital of funding expected to be used by EIF?\n\n---\n\nI'm sorry, could you just clarify or repeat that last part? I didn't quite catch it?\n\n---\n\nSure. Just in terms of the acquisition of the assets are getting drop down to EIF, what percentage of debt are you going -- are you anticipating to employ to finance that?\n\n---\n\nYes. Well, go ahead, Wanda, if you want to answer that.\n\n---\n\nWell, the transaction itself -- there'll be a large component of equity issued by the fund as consideration for the transaction. And the debt component that would be assumed within the drop down matches generally the capital structure that we've employed on the carrying value of the assets. So in this case, it would be around 60% leverage applied to the book value. So we're not introducing any incremental leverage in financing these transactions within the fund.\n\n---\n\nRegarding, I guess, the potential drop down of the U.S. asset, is the goal to also transform EEP to a high-growth entity? And perhaps like a double-digit type of distribution growth target?\n\n---\n\nWell, that certainly would be something that we would like to do at this point in time. As we said earlier, we're still evaluating that opportunity. I mean, there's certainly conceptually many of the same things that drove us to this outcome could be in place for Enbridge Energy Partners. As you know, Enbridge Energy Partners' currency has not been as strong. Its access to capital hasn't been as robust as our Enbridge Income Fund. And obviously, ultimately, what happens with Enbridge Energy Partners and potential drop downs there will also depend on the profile of the cash flows that would be dropped down. So there's a number of things in play that's why we're evaluating this over the next 2 to 3 months, and we'll come to a conclusion on that by that time.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And I just have to ask has there been any thought in terms of perhaps dropping down the gas midstream assets to MEP at some point in time?\n\n---\n\nWell, actually, MEP has its own set of assets, and it's working through its own growth plans within its franchise. There's nothing that we're contemplating to be dropping down from Enbridge Inc. Certainly, from a geographic perspective, the midstream assets that we have in Canada wouldn't fit with that. Other than that, there are no plans to do any drop downs from Enbridge with respect to gas assets.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And if I guess, if you proceed with dropping down the liquids assets to EEP, do you then envision the same type of time frame like a 3-year period with ENB providing additional support via taking back, I guess, some units?\n\n---\n\nYes, yes. Well, I guess, we get to that point, I think that's generally right. In fact, in many ways, that's what we're doing today and that Enbridge is participating in the asset growth in the U.S. assets. So I'd say, conceptually, you're right. Ultimately, the pace of that will depend on EEP's ability to access capital in the marketplace and in size. And so that's pretty much the same criteria that we would apply to the transaction that we're talking about here.\n\n---\n\nJust to follow on Sharon's question. I'd like to leave it maybe a little more open-ended and just have you comment on the potential parallel U.S. restructuring plan. Maybe if you could describe the assets being contemplated maybe make a comment on the cash flow profile, which would tie back to their development status. And then any comments you'd like to make on the potential how you're thinking about the terms, timing, and sequence? Will it be an asset by asset? Or are you thinking more in terms of EEP's ability to finance certain amount of asset purchases?\n\n---\n\nWell, yes, that last part you just mentioned is critical. But maybe let me step back a little bit here. As we've said in our announcement, we are contemplating and evaluating the same type of transaction that we are talking about here today. Generally speaking, the assets that we're talking about in size will be a little bit smaller although still very large. We've said in the past that the drop down assets that could be applied in the U.S. case would be in the range of $10 billion to $12 billion. Those assets would be certainly attractive from an MLP point of view. Some of them include, for example, the Seaway Pipeline, the Seaway Twin, Flanagan South, Spearhead. These are all very strong -- fundamentally strong cash-flow-driven assets. So I would say, there's a similar opportunity here, but as I said earlier, we're still in the stage of evaluating whether or not that could work and part of it is, as I said earlier, and you pointed out EEP's capability to raise funding and do it at a price that could be attractive both for EEP and Enbridge in terms of dropping down those assets.\n\n---\n\nMost of my questions have been answered. Can you talk a little bit more about this exchange in debt picture you're talking about? Just I might have missed that a little bit earlier?\n\n---\n\nOkay. Wanda will answer that.\n\n---\n\nYes. On the debt exchange that we outlined as a potential item that we would be considering, that's something we'll have to work through the details over the next few months on how we would undertake that, but it's something that we would be trying to do to transfer a component of the debt if bond holders are interested in an option to move from Enbridge Inc. where their debt is currently to Enbridge Income Fund, where the liquids assets would be transferred in a component of the debt of that debt at Enbridge would've been financing those assets, particularly in Enbridge Pipelines Athabasca.\n\n---\n\nJust to add a point to Wanda's comment about the option. I think, it's important here that, basically, the trade-off that would be made is that currently a debt holder at Enbridge Inc. would have certainly a diversified set of cash flows coming, including cash flows from income fund itself, but obviously, if there's a preference to have a portion of that moved down so that they're closer to the assets, that's what we're talking about here basically.\n\n---\n\nI wonder if you could clarify, I think, it was Paul Lechem's question about tilted returns in growth. You mentioned something about special terms capturing the right amount of growth for Enbridge. Are you contemplating some sort of a -- kind of a financial transaction like you did with Southern Lights, where there's a defined cash flow stream that's dropped into Enbridge Income Fund? Or maybe there is some sort of -- sorry, Enbridge Income Fund Holdings gets a different cash flow stream? And maybe there's a separate class of shares at the Enbridge Income Fund level for Enbridge Inc.? Maybe you could just walk us through the parameters of how you might, at the Enbridge Inc, retain certain growth elements?\n\n---\n\nOkay, Richard?\n\n---\n\nSure. Well, Linda, I think the main tool there is the incentive distribution, right? And it's probably premature at this point to get into some of the details that you suggested, but those are obviously all transactional details or features that could be considered in the discussions between Enbridge and the special committee of the Enbridge Income Fund. So I just think, it's too soon to get into those details at this point.\n\n---\n\nAnd just as a follow-up. Can you confirm that there is no specific direct tax benefit contemplated for any of the entity levels at this point?\n\n---\n\nThere's nothing major in any of the entities. This will be transacted as tax-free rollovers. So there's really no major tax items. Do you have anything to add, Wanda, to that?\n\n---\n\nNo, Al. I don't have anything to add. That's absolutely correct.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Thanks, Wanda.\n\n---\n\nI guess to say it from a U.S. bond holder perspective, to say for example from the cake probably isn't it. Kind of follow up on Ross' call. What's the -- what are your intentions regarding the U.S. dollar Enbridge Inc Fund? It looks to be a kind of unfair that Canadian holders are being allowed to potentially move down closer to the assets. And the holding company, down in the U.S., is just basically being left to swing?\n\n---\n\nWell, in terms of the U.S. debt at Enbridge Inc., we still have all the U.S. assets within the structure. We still have the strong credit support within Enbridge that's supporting those assets. And we're going to still have strong cash flow from Enbridge Income Fund even after the completion of this transaction. And I think as the year progresses, and we're looking at the U.S. transaction, we'll be considering other things in terms of debt holdings at the Enbridge Inc. level that may include the U.S. bonds as we think about our U.S. restructuring as we work through those items if that transaction progresses.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And that sounds a little bit more fair, and particularly, and I guess just looking at your Slide 20 -- sorry, your Slide 30, you highlight the enhanced and diversified access of $44 billion of growth capital. And go back to Slide 23, and I see your equity requirement goes from $1.9 billion to $1.5 billion yet the debt holding -- the debt requirement is still at $15 billion. So I guess your bonds are 20 to 40 wider on the day, I think, you need to kind of do right by bond holders somewhere along the way here because your leverage is definitely going up, and you've got a lot of issuance to go. And that's a rough way to start the road.\n\n---\n\nWell, in the end our leverage from this transaction will not be going up on a consolidated basis. And if we actually -- when we look at this from -- on a de-consolidated basis, our metrics actually improved at the Enbridge Inc. level for our bond holders. There is more coverage of the debt on a de-consolidated basis as a result of this transaction. So we're financing the increase in the dividend through incremental equity. That equity will be issued -- as we mentioned, there'll be flexibility. Our plan lays out that we will see increased on equity issuances at Enbridge Income Fund Holdings, it will be financing the growth during the period through the equity, but we're not introducing any incremental leverage into the structure as a result.\n\n---\n\nAnd Jack, it's Richard Bird. Maybe I'll just add on to Wanda's comments. I think, on Page 23, you might be focusing on the wrong line in understanding the change in equity. The bottom line there is how much equity has been raised at the Enbridge level. But really the overall structure -- you want to go to the top line, which is 62 -- 6.2 to 8.4. So there is additional equity being raised to replace every additional dollar that's being paid out. And I think, Wanda's comment on de-consolidated credit metrics, yes, it's the Canadian debt, which will in part get the opportunity to move into the income fund. The income fund doesn't really have U.S. assets to fund. So moving U.S. debt into the income fund wouldn't make any sense. But because of the Canadian debt is moving into the income fund, that's the de-levering that's occurring at the Enbridge level. So there's less depth in total to be serviced by the assets, the diversified range of assets that are being held by Enbridge. So I think, there is a benefit to the U.S. debt holders indirectly from that Canadian debt moving into the fund.\n\n---\n\nYes, I think we're going to have to agree to disagree on that one.\n\n---\n\nJust 2 questions. First, in terms of -- historically, when we've seen drop downs to EIF, there's been quite a detailed review process by the independent directors. Once this full suite of assets is dropped down, will subsequent acquisitions by EIFH require that same sort of detailed analysis? Or will that process then be much quicker?\n\n---\n\nYes, that's a good question, David. Good observation. So the special committee process in this instance will occur at the front end, and that we're talking about essentially 1 drop down. So that would be reviewed by the independent committee of the EIF Board, and so that will occur at the front end. Subsequent to that, the answer to your question is, no, because the way that this gets affected essentially is by EIFH acquiring additional interest in EIF. And so the only issue there would be at what price those -- the equity is raised to fund those investments in EIFH. And it will have to obviously be financially attractive for EIFH to do that at that point in time. But the process will not be iterated in terms of what we do at the upfront part of it.\n\n---\n\nPerfect. And then, last question is just -- just because, I think, Linda touched a little bit on this. The Southern Lights Class A shares and the Hardisty growth agreements, I assume that both of those were with EPI entities. How do those agreements survive this or not? Maybe does that become...\n\n---\n\nWanda?\n\n---\n\nI'm sorry. Go ahead.\n\n---\n\nGo ahead, Wanda.\n\n---\n\nYes. You're right, David. There are agreements in place as a result of the other drop downs. To really with this drop down, we will be effectively transferring the residual interest that are remaining within the Enbridge structures, so EPI does own the residual interest in Southern Lights Canada, and we'd also be looking at the residual interest in Southern Lights after we take into account the Class A investment, and then the Hardisty Terminal arrangement that we held back, we would also be dropping down. So effectively, those structures within the fund could be wound, if we're able to progress the transaction with those assets in as part of the negotiations with the fund. So it would collapse those arrangements because they would be owning the full asset.\n\n---\n\nJust a real quick follow-up for me. Actually, how do you guys think about the kind of leverage ratios as you're going through this transformations? Then I have 1 follow-up.\n\n---\n\nI think, the question was how do we look at the leverage ratio with respect to EEP? Is that?\n\n---\n\nYes, exactly, at the EEP.\n\n---\n\nWe're just trying to think through your question here. I'm not sure that...\n\n---\n\nBasically, what -- yes, go ahead.\n\n---\n\nEEP, of course, is -- it has its own approach to capital structure, which is not dissimilar to that of our own. So I think, when we're -- if I see -- if I'm understanding your question right, when we're contemplating the drop down there, I think it's pretty much the same thinking that we go through in terms of ensuring that it's going to be able to maintain its financial strength. So it will need to raise the appropriate amount of equity with respect to any assets that are dropped down relative to the debt. So I would say our approach to leverage and ensuring that EEP is a strong entity is unchanged. I suppose, you could extend that to say if we proceed with that transaction, it will certainly be, I guess, stronger from a credit point of view, just given the greater level of assets and the nature of those assets if we were to go down that road, but we're ways away from making that call.\n\n---\n\nOkay. So basically what I was getting at is, won't there be a situation where you guys consider kind of overequitizing the drops?\n\n---\n\nOverequitizing the drops. Well, again, I'm trying to anticipate what you're getting at here. What we would do at EEP, again, is to the extent that EEP could observe absorb the drop down and fund it with the right amount of equity, Enbridge would still be there to ensure that the growth program that was dropped down effectively would be funded because we can't put that at risk. So hopefully that answers your question, but if it doesn't, please follow up.\n\n---\n\nYes. You know what? I'll follow-up offline.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Christine. We have nothing further to add at this time, but I'd remind you that Leigh and I will be available for follow-up questions if you may have any. Thank you, and have a good day.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Linda Ezergailis (Analysts)】\nI have some questions about the associated EBITDA and maintenance capital and cash taxes on your $17 billion of identified Canadian assets as well as the $15 billion of growth CapEx. If you can help us out with that, that would be very helpful.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Al Monaco (Executives)】\nLinda, I don't think we're going to go through the details here on the call. I think the number that we can provide now related to the assets we're dropping down is in the order of $2 billion. So obviously, we'll be working through the rest of the numbers as we evaluate the transaction with the Enbridge Income Fund. So that's where we are at the moment on that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Linda Ezergailis (Analysts)】\nSorry, EBITDA of $2 billion?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Al Monaco (Executives)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Linda Ezergailis (Analysts)】\nAnd maintenance capital?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Al Monaco (Executives)】\nI'm sorry, we don't have the associated maintenance capital right now. But I guess maybe -- unless Wanda, you have that figure with you?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. Opheim (Executives)】\nNo.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Al Monaco (Executives)】\nYes. So we will have to get back on that. We don't have that detail at the moment.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Linda Ezergailis (Analysts)】\nOkay, and can we also get at some point some sense of cash taxes, especially at the Enbridge Income Fund and Enbridge Income Fund Holdings level that has been sometimes quite volatile year-to-year. So some guidance over the next number of years will be very helpful as well.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Al Monaco (Executives)】\nYes. We will plan to do that as we move forward with the transaction.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Linda Ezergailis (Analysts)】\nOkay. And just a clean-up question. Can you just confirm that there's going to be no delta to the incentive split for Enbridge from either on Enbridge Income Fund or EEP at any point?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Al Monaco (Executives)】\nWe can confirm that. There's no change anticipated there.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Theodore Durbin (Analysts)】\nI'm wondering where you've taken the payout ratio now as you think about additional drop down potentially to EEP and whatnot? Where could that payout ratio ultimately go, if you are successful with that step of the structuring?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Al Monaco (Executives)】\nWell, I think as we've discussed there, Ted, the payout ratio has been designed specifically to account for the capital profile that we have and the growth capital as we've talked about earlier. So we're moving from 75% -- we'll have a range of 75% to 85%. And the payout itself will match that over time moving from the lower end of that to the higher end through the next few years. So at this point, that's the policy that we've come to and that's what we expect for at least the next 3 to 4 years.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Theodore Durbin (Analysts)】\nOkay.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Al Monaco (Executives)】\nObviously, with -- sorry, just to add on there. Obviously, with the cash flow that we have and our ability to access additional funding through EIFH, that could change. But at this point, that's the policy.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Theodore Durbin (Analysts)】\nGot it. And then again, as you think about EEP, the 13x to 15x multiple on the drop downs that you're talking about today, does that seem like the appropriate multiple to EEP? Or how do you think through the accretion dilution for them?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Al Monaco (Executives)】\nYes. Well, that -- as you know, that multiple will depend on a number of things. For EEP, importantly, it's been a bit of a different situation there. The valuation and its currency hasn't been as strong for a number of reasons. So really, the multiple that we think of in terms of EEP will be just be dependent on the growth outlook, the ability for EEP to pay a sufficient price to Enbridge for the assets, so that will be determined as we move forward.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Theodore Durbin (Analysts)】\nGot it.\r\n[Audio Gap]\r\nhere with a higher dividend payout that you're seeing less on the organic growth opportunities maybe in the out years of the plan or if you look with the lower commodity price environment? Is that something that we're implicitly signaling with this? Or is that still expected to be where it's been?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Al Monaco (Executives)】\nNo, I would say it's actually the opposite, Ted. We're very encouraged by what we see in terms of organic opportunities. More generally, the opportunities that North America is very strong for energy infrastructure, we don't see that abating anytime soon, at all. With respect to the dividend payout itself, as we've said, we've been pretty conservative in our approach. We've been waiting through the last couple of years to ensure that we've got a lot of the funding locked down. I think we've been very successful raising about $16 billion in the last couple of years to ensure the funding of the capital program. We've made very good progress. The cash flow -- free cash flow is expected to increase in the next 3 or 4 years as we've explained, so we think this is the right time to increase the dividend payout. So I would say, it's not driven by our organic growth outlook at all.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Lechem (Analysts)】\nI'm just wondering if the credit rating agencies have had a view of this? And whether their -- so we can change, I think, from one of the rating agencies replacing Enbridge on a negative outlook. Whether that was in contemplation of this transaction or if they were unaware of what you're suggesting now?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Al Monaco (Executives)】\nWanda?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. Opheim (Executives)】\nYes. We did review this transaction with the rating agencies. So they are aware of it. They have all -- they are all in the process of putting out reports this morning. S&P had applied a negative outlook to Enbridge in advance of this transaction and the reports this morning we are seeing Moody's has put out a report and DBRS, and they are both have put Enbridge on a negative outlook or looking at under developing -- under a developing on the outlook. It should be noted that for Enbridge Income Fund, this is a very positive transaction, so we should see a rating. And for Enbridge, there are steps we were taking to manage the transaction for our debt holders with the debt exchange that we mentioned in the press release that we are contemplating.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Al Monaco (Executives)】\nI think, may be, I'll just add on another comment to what Wanda said. We don't believe, there's going to be a reduction in credit strength here to Enbridge. In fact, if you look at it from an Enbridge Inc.'s debt holder perspective, they're going to still have access to the diversified cash flow of this business. The offering that we'll make in terms of exchanging potentially into EIF debt will be hopeful, we believe. And the bottom line is that from a consolidated point of view, the leverage here doesn't change. So we think, we're going to maintain our financial strength overall.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Lechem (Analysts)】\nOkay. If I can have one more question. I'm just wondering around the tilted returns and the volume benefits on the mainline from the CPS agreement over time. How should we think about the $2 billion EBITDA number that you mentioned on the assets being dropped down? What does that grow to under your calculations over time from the tilted returns and the volume benefits on the mainline? And does dropping these assets down impact Enbridge's growth in the out years won't be getting the direct benefits anymore from those tilted returns and the volume growth?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Al Monaco (Executives)】\nOkay. I'll start, and then I'll hand it to Richard for any further information. First of all, Enbridge will continue to participate in the growth of the assets and in particular, the tilted returns through its investment in EIF. So that's not going to change. It's going to held a little bit differently. There is -- there will also be some elements, we're sure that when we get through the details of the discussions with the Enbridge Income Fund special committee that will be reflected in the terms of the drop down, that will allow us to ensure we're capturing the right amount of growth for Enbridge Inc. So those are my comments on that. Richard, do you have anything to add?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Bird (Executives)】\nI think that pretty well covers it. And of course, the incentive mechanism that's built into the income fund structure provides a tool for appropriately capturing the benefits of those tilted returns as we move further into the future. But the details of that transaction will come out of the negotiations with the special committee over the course of the early part of next year. So that's about what we have for now.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Kwan (Analysts)】\nAl, you might have answered this in some way just by saying that you think the financial strength and the credit quality hasn't changed, but I'm just wondering, are you going to be explicitly managing to a specific credit rating at the ENB level? And I guess, specifically, the plan to fund the \"equity\" $1.5 billion via preferred, and I assume that's $3 billion than of notional value, does that potentially move around depending how the rating agencies fall? And I guess you've got the wiggle room here with almost $0.5 billion of the trip that Wanda mentioned you expect to curtail?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Al Monaco (Executives)】\nWell, let me see. And the first part is to managing to a credit rating. First of all, as we said, we don't really see any reduction in the credit strength of our entities. In fact, as Wanda pointed out in terms of the income fund, it strengthens further, I would say. We're going to have to wait and see what the rating agencies say. Certainly, they're going to be looking at this transaction, and we'll just wait for what they say. In terms of the preferred equity, Wanda, do you have a comment on that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. Opheim (Executives)】\nYes. Robert, you're correct. That's what it would translate into, under the criteria into the -- into $3 billion, and we'll look at our options on preferred shares through the period, as well as other hybrid instruments that we could consider. And as Al mentioned, we will continue to work with the agencies. That's what we're planning to do over the next period as we provide them with more information, and they can get more comfortable with what this transaction means as because as Al indicated, we do feel that credit strength of the company has been maintained, and we're not introducing any incremental leverage.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Kwan (Analysts)】\nRight. I guess, maybe just putting it differently. If the market for both your bonds and preferreds kind of takes your view that the credit strength hasn't changed, and therefore, the pricing doesn't materially change. Are you then really that fast at the rating agencies go to, say, BBB, BAA 2? Are you really going to take the queue from the market, I guess, is the question?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Al Monaco (Executives)】\nGo ahead.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. Opheim (Executives)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Kwan (Analysts)】\nOkay. And just one last question. How sensitive is the EPS accretion and your funding plan, and the future EPS growth to the share price/valuation of Enbridge Income Fund as it tries to fill that $600 million to $800 million equity cap?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Al Monaco (Executives)】\nWell, the whole premise here, of course, is that we're capturing the value of Enbridge's -- Enbridge Income Fund's ability to raise capital at effective prices. So obviously, the arbitrage between the 2 needs to be maintained in order to be effective. We referenced earlier, there's a number of factors that go into that, including the IDR mechanism that Enbridge retains and there's an element of growth there so I -- we can't get specific as to what the sensitivities are per each change in Enbridge Income Fund dollar value share price. But suffice to say that this does depend on the efficiency of capturing that valuation arbitrage between the 2.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Bird (Executives)】\nOkay, Al, maybe I could just add into that, that in the math that's run out here in terms of the guidance on the impact of the transaction, we obviously have assumed some enhancements in the value of the fund that would be difficult to imagine the fund not picking up some value as a result of this drop down transaction, but pretty conservative view of that value enhancements, what's baked into the numbers at the moment certainly relative to what we and our financial advisers think could be the outcome. So -- and I think, it's pretty solid the way it's been portrayed here.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Kuske (Analysts)】\nMaybe we can continue with the cake analogy and just on the icing. So the structure that you proposed last night, and the stock market reaction is weren't obviously very positive. But I guess, do you think about this as the genesis of this is really the valuation delta you see in the market? And then, I guess, the cake analogy comes in with -- this is obviously pretty pain staking what you've done, but the flavor might not be for everybody. And so is this along the lines of an icing front of versus more popular butter cream kind of icing that you used to be?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Al Monaco (Executives)】\nWell, I don't even know what those mean. But I'll try and answer your question. As I said, the way we're looking at this is we have a very strong base plan previous to this change in payout policy and previous to the drop down announcement. And -- but the reality is that in order for us to be competitive, we need to be ensuring that our valuation is maximized. So we're looking to the icing here to whatever kind of icing you want to describe it as really boosting or maximizing the value of what is already a very good plan. And it's our job to do that, and we think that this structure and combination with the dividend payout will hopefully be reflected in the marketplace as we think it will. Richard?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Kuske (Analysts)】\nSo I guess, just to follow-up...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Bird (Executives)】\nIt's Richard, and maybe I'll just add to that cake and icing part of the discussion. So the cake, I think, management has always felt is a very strong cake. And one of the frustrations perhaps that might have been apparent in some perspectives we've provided in the past, including Enbridge Days, is we never really felt the market was fully capturing the value of that cake in the market valuation. So the way we look at it, this overall approach both enhances the underlying value by reducing the cost of funding, and we're always trying to maximize that spread between the return on the assets and the cost of funding the assets. But hopefully, also gives rise to a little better recognition in the market of how good the cake always has been.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Kuske (Analysts)】\nOkay, that's very helpful. And then with the future proposed structure, do you foresee a potential for some kind of holding company discount to be applied on an Enbridge level is the ownership levels of the underlying and especially ENF will be quite high. And so that's something you haven't really had to deal with or addressed before is even though the ownership levels were high, the overall asset value relative to Enbridge Inc. wasn't tremendous and now that equation is changing a bit. So do you foresee that kind of problem happening in the future?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Al Monaco (Executives)】\nYes. Andrew, it's Al. The short answer is, no, and that's for a couple of reasons. The first reason is that when we look at the fundamental value of the cash flows, and this is where Richard was going, we actually see a discount already in the marketplace and part of what we're trying to do here is close that gap. I would say that secondly, when you think of holding company discounts in the traditional sense, they're usually in cases where the vehicles beneath the holding company are different types of businesses, different types of industries, and in our case, we have a very homogenous asset grouping. It's either liquids pipelines or gas pipelines or something awfully, awfully similar. So, no, we don't see that as a problem, and hopefully, the discount that we're seeing today will be closed up.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Catellier (Analysts)】\nI was wondering if you could discuss how this restructuring really affects your capital deployment criteria, notwithstanding, if we ignore from it and the reaction and the share price? But how you approach evaluating your acquisition criteria? And related to that, is there any increased capacity to make acquisitions at the Enbridge Inc. level understanding and, of course, you're going to look at your acquisition and leverage metrics on a consolidated basis?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Al Monaco (Executives)】\nOkay. That's a good question, Rob. Well, first of all, as to how we evaluate investments, frankly, I don't think that is going to change. I mean, at the end of the day, there's all kinds of metrics that we use out there, but we have always looked at future cash flows and the appropriate discount rate to apply to those cash flows as our main criteria. And we're very careful about ensuring that we apply the right discount rate through identifying risks and making sure we can mitigate those risks. So typically, we've tried to ensure that we have a very good spread between what we see as a return on the project versus what we think the true cost of equity capital is for that particular asset that we're looking in. So I would say, it doesn't really change our overall point of view on how we evaluate investments from what we've done here. Obviously, of course, with an improved valuation, which we're hoping to get, that would help to reduce our overall cost of capital. So there's certainly -- is that upside. With respect to acquisitions, I think, you're right, improved valuation will certainly help that. But as I said earlier on, the basic approach and strategies to the business is not going to change. So we may have a better currency, we hope, and that will certainly give us more opportunity to affect some of the things we've been talking about around increasing the footprint and potentially more natural gas opportunities, but that will remain to be seen based on the quality of what we see out there.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Catellier (Analysts)】\nOkay. I understand where you're going with that. But I wondered if though, in your strategy and if your advisers have indicated there's an increased capacity notwithstanding, you may have a better currency. Do you actually have more capacity to go out at the Enbridge Inc. level and maybe make strategic investments. And similar to that, in the past, you've been reluctant, I guess, to dilute the growth rate of the company through strategic investments that maybe aren't as accretive in the short-term, and with your higher dividend and EPS growth rate now under the structure, does your appetite undertake maybe a growth dilutive acquisition or investment change?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Al Monaco (Executives)】\nOkay, okay. So the first part of your question around capacity. I think there will be more capacity. If you look at the Enbridge Income Fund and potentially even Enbridge Energy Partners down the road, the fact that they can raise capital effectively will certainly provide us more flexibility going forward as they will be funding a good portion of the growth that we'll be talking about here. On the second part, the strategic investments, I think, you said, we may have been reluctant. I'm not sure, I would put it in those terms. In our case, we've had such a fantastic organic program in front of us that's what we've focused on. We have made strategic investments as Seaway was a good one and we capitalized on that one very quickly when we saw the opportunity. So I wouldn't say we're hesitant. I think I would still categorize what we'll do in the future is still a very disciplined approach. As I said, we maybe have a bit more flex with an improved valuation. And -- but as I said, we'll have to see what opportunities arise, and whether or not we want to use that currency.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Noseworthy (Analysts)】\nJust a couple of clean-up questions. First on the $2 billion EBITDA, is that a 2015 number? Or what is that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Al Monaco (Executives)】\nYes, yes, it's 2015.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Noseworthy (Analysts)】\nOkay, perfect. And then secondly, with respect to the -- I'll call it the IDR with EIF or -- is that going to remain flat at 25%? Or are you contemplating something else?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Al Monaco (Executives)】\nNo, we're not contemplating any change there, David.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Noseworthy (Analysts)】\nOkay, perfect. And then finally, in terms of the plan, is the -- what is the percentage debt sort of capital of funding expected to be used by EIF?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Al Monaco (Executives)】\nI'm sorry, could you just clarify or repeat that last part? I didn't quite catch it?\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Noseworthy (Analysts)】\nSure. Just in terms of the acquisition of the assets are getting drop down to EIF, what percentage of debt are you going -- are you anticipating to employ to finance that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Al Monaco (Executives)】\nYes. Well, go ahead, Wanda, if you want to answer that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. Opheim (Executives)】\nWell, the transaction itself -- there'll be a large component of equity issued by the fund as consideration for the transaction. And the debt component that would be assumed within the drop down matches generally the capital structure that we've employed on the carrying value of the assets. So in this case, it would be around 60% leverage applied to the book value. So we're not introducing any incremental leverage in financing these transactions within the fund.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sharon Lui (Analysts)】\nRegarding, I guess, the potential drop down of the U.S. asset, is the goal to also transform EEP to a high-growth entity? And perhaps like a double-digit type of distribution growth target?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Al Monaco (Executives)】\nWell, that certainly would be something that we would like to do at this point in time. As we said earlier, we're still evaluating that opportunity. I mean, there's certainly conceptually many of the same things that drove us to this outcome could be in place for Enbridge Energy Partners. As you know, Enbridge Energy Partners' currency has not been as strong. Its access to capital hasn't been as robust as our Enbridge Income Fund. And obviously, ultimately, what happens with Enbridge Energy Partners and potential drop downs there will also depend on the profile of the cash flows that would be dropped down. So there's a number of things in play that's why we're evaluating this over the next 2 to 3 months, and we'll come to a conclusion on that by that time.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sharon Lui (Analysts)】\nOkay. And I just have to ask has there been any thought in terms of perhaps dropping down the gas midstream assets to MEP at some point in time?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Al Monaco (Executives)】\nWell, actually, MEP has its own set of assets, and it's working through its own growth plans within its franchise. There's nothing that we're contemplating to be dropping down from Enbridge Inc. Certainly, from a geographic perspective, the midstream assets that we have in Canada wouldn't fit with that. Other than that, there are no plans to do any drop downs from Enbridge with respect to gas assets.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sharon Lui (Analysts)】\nOkay. And if I guess, if you proceed with dropping down the liquids assets to EEP, do you then envision the same type of time frame like a 3-year period with ENB providing additional support via taking back, I guess, some units?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Al Monaco (Executives)】\nYes, yes. Well, I guess, we get to that point, I think that's generally right. In fact, in many ways, that's what we're doing today and that Enbridge is participating in the asset growth in the U.S. assets. So I'd say, conceptually, you're right. Ultimately, the pace of that will depend on EEP's ability to access capital in the marketplace and in size. And so that's pretty much the same criteria that we would apply to the transaction that we're talking about here.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Reichman (Analysts)】\nJust to follow on Sharon's question. I'd like to leave it maybe a little more open-ended and just have you comment on the potential parallel U.S. restructuring plan. Maybe if you could describe the assets being contemplated maybe make a comment on the cash flow profile, which would tie back to their development status. And then any comments you'd like to make on the potential how you're thinking about the terms, timing, and sequence? Will it be an asset by asset? Or are you thinking more in terms of EEP's ability to finance certain amount of asset purchases?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Al Monaco (Executives)】\nWell, yes, that last part you just mentioned is critical. But maybe let me step back a little bit here. As we've said in our announcement, we are contemplating and evaluating the same type of transaction that we are talking about here today. Generally speaking, the assets that we're talking about in size will be a little bit smaller although still very large. We've said in the past that the drop down assets that could be applied in the U.S. case would be in the range of $10 billion to $12 billion. Those assets would be certainly attractive from an MLP point of view. Some of them include, for example, the Seaway Pipeline, the Seaway Twin, Flanagan South, Spearhead. These are all very strong -- fundamentally strong cash-flow-driven assets. So I would say, there's a similar opportunity here, but as I said earlier, we're still in the stage of evaluating whether or not that could work and part of it is, as I said earlier, and you pointed out EEP's capability to raise funding and do it at a price that could be attractive both for EEP and Enbridge in terms of dropping down those assets.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Russell Payne (Analysts)】\nMost of my questions have been answered. Can you talk a little bit more about this exchange in debt picture you're talking about? Just I might have missed that a little bit earlier?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Al Monaco (Executives)】\nOkay. Wanda will answer that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. Opheim (Executives)】\nYes. On the debt exchange that we outlined as a potential item that we would be considering, that's something we'll have to work through the details over the next few months on how we would undertake that, but it's something that we would be trying to do to transfer a component of the debt if bond holders are interested in an option to move from Enbridge Inc. where their debt is currently to Enbridge Income Fund, where the liquids assets would be transferred in a component of the debt of that debt at Enbridge would've been financing those assets, particularly in Enbridge Pipelines Athabasca.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Al Monaco (Executives)】\nJust to add a point to Wanda's comment about the option. I think, it's important here that, basically, the trade-off that would be made is that currently a debt holder at Enbridge Inc. would have certainly a diversified set of cash flows coming, including cash flows from income fund itself, but obviously, if there's a preference to have a portion of that moved down so that they're closer to the assets, that's what we're talking about here basically.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Linda Ezergailis (Analysts)】\nI wonder if you could clarify, I think, it was Paul Lechem's question about tilted returns in growth. You mentioned something about special terms capturing the right amount of growth for Enbridge. Are you contemplating some sort of a -- kind of a financial transaction like you did with Southern Lights, where there's a defined cash flow stream that's dropped into Enbridge Income Fund? Or maybe there is some sort of -- sorry, Enbridge Income Fund Holdings gets a different cash flow stream? And maybe there's a separate class of shares at the Enbridge Income Fund level for Enbridge Inc.? Maybe you could just walk us through the parameters of how you might, at the Enbridge Inc, retain certain growth elements?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Al Monaco (Executives)】\nOkay, Richard?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Bird (Executives)】\nSure. Well, Linda, I think the main tool there is the incentive distribution, right? And it's probably premature at this point to get into some of the details that you suggested, but those are obviously all transactional details or features that could be considered in the discussions between Enbridge and the special committee of the Enbridge Income Fund. So I just think, it's too soon to get into those details at this point.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Linda Ezergailis (Analysts)】\nAnd just as a follow-up. Can you confirm that there is no specific direct tax benefit contemplated for any of the entity levels at this point?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Al Monaco (Executives)】\nThere's nothing major in any of the entities. This will be transacted as tax-free rollovers. So there's really no major tax items. Do you have anything to add, Wanda, to that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. Opheim (Executives)】\nNo, Al. I don't have anything to add. That's absolutely correct.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Al Monaco (Executives)】\nOkay. Thanks, Wanda.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jeffrey Healy (Analysts)】\nI guess to say it from a U.S. bond holder perspective, to say for example from the cake probably isn't it. Kind of follow up on Ross' call. What's the -- what are your intentions regarding the U.S. dollar Enbridge Inc Fund? It looks to be a kind of unfair that Canadian holders are being allowed to potentially move down closer to the assets. And the holding company, down in the U.S., is just basically being left to swing?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. Opheim (Executives)】\nWell, in terms of the U.S. debt at Enbridge Inc., we still have all the U.S. assets within the structure. We still have the strong credit support within Enbridge that's supporting those assets. And we're going to still have strong cash flow from Enbridge Income Fund even after the completion of this transaction. And I think as the year progresses, and we're looking at the U.S. transaction, we'll be considering other things in terms of debt holdings at the Enbridge Inc. level that may include the U.S. bonds as we think about our U.S. restructuring as we work through those items if that transaction progresses.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jeffrey Healy (Analysts)】\nOkay. And that sounds a little bit more fair, and particularly, and I guess just looking at your Slide 20 -- sorry, your Slide 30, you highlight the enhanced and diversified access of $44 billion of growth capital. And go back to Slide 23, and I see your equity requirement goes from $1.9 billion to $1.5 billion yet the debt holding -- the debt requirement is still at $15 billion. So I guess your bonds are 20 to 40 wider on the day, I think, you need to kind of do right by bond holders somewhere along the way here because your leverage is definitely going up, and you've got a lot of issuance to go. And that's a rough way to start the road.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. Opheim (Executives)】\nWell, in the end our leverage from this transaction will not be going up on a consolidated basis. And if we actually -- when we look at this from -- on a de-consolidated basis, our metrics actually improved at the Enbridge Inc. level for our bond holders. There is more coverage of the debt on a de-consolidated basis as a result of this transaction. So we're financing the increase in the dividend through incremental equity. That equity will be issued -- as we mentioned, there'll be flexibility. Our plan lays out that we will see increased on equity issuances at Enbridge Income Fund Holdings, it will be financing the growth during the period through the equity, but we're not introducing any incremental leverage into the structure as a result.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Bird (Executives)】\nAnd Jack, it's Richard Bird. Maybe I'll just add on to Wanda's comments. I think, on Page 23, you might be focusing on the wrong line in understanding the change in equity. The bottom line there is how much equity has been raised at the Enbridge level. But really the overall structure -- you want to go to the top line, which is 62 -- 6.2 to 8.4. So there is additional equity being raised to replace every additional dollar that's being paid out. And I think, Wanda's comment on de-consolidated credit metrics, yes, it's the Canadian debt, which will in part get the opportunity to move into the income fund. The income fund doesn't really have U.S. assets to fund. So moving U.S. debt into the income fund wouldn't make any sense. But because of the Canadian debt is moving into the income fund, that's the de-levering that's occurring at the Enbridge level. So there's less depth in total to be serviced by the assets, the diversified range of assets that are being held by Enbridge. So I think, there is a benefit to the U.S. debt holders indirectly from that Canadian debt moving into the fund.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jeffrey Healy (Analysts)】\nYes, I think we're going to have to agree to disagree on that one.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Noseworthy (Analysts)】\nJust 2 questions. First, in terms of -- historically, when we've seen drop downs to EIF, there's been quite a detailed review process by the independent directors. Once this full suite of assets is dropped down, will subsequent acquisitions by EIFH require that same sort of detailed analysis? Or will that process then be much quicker?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Al Monaco (Executives)】\nYes, that's a good question, David. Good observation. So the special committee process in this instance will occur at the front end, and that we're talking about essentially 1 drop down. So that would be reviewed by the independent committee of the EIF Board, and so that will occur at the front end. Subsequent to that, the answer to your question is, no, because the way that this gets affected essentially is by EIFH acquiring additional interest in EIF. And so the only issue there would be at what price those -- the equity is raised to fund those investments in EIFH. And it will have to obviously be financially attractive for EIFH to do that at that point in time. But the process will not be iterated in terms of what we do at the upfront part of it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Noseworthy (Analysts)】\nPerfect. And then, last question is just -- just because, I think, Linda touched a little bit on this. The Southern Lights Class A shares and the Hardisty growth agreements, I assume that both of those were with EPI entities. How do those agreements survive this or not? Maybe does that become...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Al Monaco (Executives)】\nWanda?\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Noseworthy (Analysts)】\nI'm sorry. Go ahead.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Al Monaco (Executives)】\nGo ahead, Wanda.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. Opheim (Executives)】\nYes. You're right, David. There are agreements in place as a result of the other drop downs. To really with this drop down, we will be effectively transferring the residual interest that are remaining within the Enbridge structures, so EPI does own the residual interest in Southern Lights Canada, and we'd also be looking at the residual interest in Southern Lights after we take into account the Class A investment, and then the Hardisty Terminal arrangement that we held back, we would also be dropping down. So effectively, those structures within the fund could be wound, if we're able to progress the transaction with those assets in as part of the negotiations with the fund. So it would collapse those arrangements because they would be owning the full asset.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Timm Schneider (Analysts)】\nJust a real quick follow-up for me. Actually, how do you guys think about the kind of leverage ratios as you're going through this transformations? Then I have 1 follow-up.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Al Monaco (Executives)】\nI think, the question was how do we look at the leverage ratio with respect to EEP? Is that?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Timm Schneider (Analysts)】\nYes, exactly, at the EEP.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Al Monaco (Executives)】\nWe're just trying to think through your question here. I'm not sure that...\n\n---\n\n【質問: Timm Schneider (Analysts)】\nBasically, what -- yes, go ahead.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Al Monaco (Executives)】\nEEP, of course, is -- it has its own approach to capital structure, which is not dissimilar to that of our own. So I think, when we're -- if I see -- if I'm understanding your question right, when we're contemplating the drop down there, I think it's pretty much the same thinking that we go through in terms of ensuring that it's going to be able to maintain its financial strength. So it will need to raise the appropriate amount of equity with respect to any assets that are dropped down relative to the debt. So I would say our approach to leverage and ensuring that EEP is a strong entity is unchanged. I suppose, you could extend that to say if we proceed with that transaction, it will certainly be, I guess, stronger from a credit point of view, just given the greater level of assets and the nature of those assets if we were to go down that road, but we're ways away from making that call.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Timm Schneider (Analysts)】\nOkay. So basically what I was getting at is, won't there be a situation where you guys consider kind of overequitizing the drops?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Al Monaco (Executives)】\nOverequitizing the drops. Well, again, I'm trying to anticipate what you're getting at here. What we would do at EEP, again, is to the extent that EEP could observe absorb the drop down and fund it with the right amount of equity, Enbridge would still be there to ensure that the growth program that was dropped down effectively would be funded because we can't put that at risk. So hopefully that answers your question, but if it doesn't, please follow up.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Timm Schneider (Analysts)】\nYes. You know what? I'll follow-up offline.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Adam McKnight (Executives)】\nThank you, Christine. We have nothing further to add at this time, but I'd remind you that Leigh and I will be available for follow-up questions if you may have any. Thank you, and have a good day.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you, Emily. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially.\r\nA detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information.\r\nBoth our third quarter press release, which includes a reconciliation of certain non-GAAP measures discussed today, and our prepared remarks in this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] \r\nThanks, again, to those who participated in our October investor conference in person or via webcast. We appreciate that many of you made the trip to Cincinnati, and as always, we enjoyed the dialogue and the opportunity to show you our stores. \r\nI will now turn the call over to Rodney McMullen, Kroger's Chief Executive Officer.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Cindy, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's third quarter 2014 results are Mike Ellis, Kroger's President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Schlotman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\r\nKroger continues to deliver consistently remarkable results. We are well on our way to achieving our 10th consecutive year of lowering costs and reinvesting those savings in our people, products, pricing and improved store experience, which together are driving our growth. Few can deliver this level of sustainable high performance. \r\nAfter a while, it can be easy to take this consistency and reliability for granted. So it's important to keep in mind that these results are possible only because 375,000 associates engage with our customers every single day. \r\nOur associates delivered yet another quality quarter of inspired Customer 1st performance. We continue to implement our growth strategy and consistently deliver on the key performance indicators we first outlined in October 2012. \r\nIn the third quarter, we achieved our 44th consecutive quarter of positive identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel. We exceeded our goal to slightly expand FIFO operating margin without fuel on a rolling 4-quarter basis, and we continued to gain market share. \r\nOur third quarter financial results were driven by strong sales and core business performance, which was better than we expected. Higher fuel margins drove our results above our previous guidance range. \r\nOur guidance range for the full year assumes fuel margins will not be as strong in the fourth quarter as they were in the third quarter. Mike Schlotman will have more to say about our supermarket fuel operations in a few minutes. \r\nHow our customers are doing today depends on the stability of their family finances. Overall, our customers continue to spend a little more as confidence in the economy improves over time. While inflation is apparent in certain commodities, fuel prices have been going down, which helps all customers, especially those on a budget. We try to help those customers stretch their food budget in a variety of ways. Our weekly promotions and fuel rewards help, along with price investments. \r\nWe continue to make natural and organic foods affordable and accessible to all customers, especially with Simple Truth. Our expansive corporate brands offering is resonating with customers seeking high-quality food at very good prices. \r\nIn fact, our Corporate Brands had their best performance in several years in the third quarter. Our ability to deliver this combination of value sets us apart. \r\nNow I will turn it over to Mike Ellis to discuss our operational performance in the third quarter. Mike?\n\n---\n\nThanks, Rodney. Good morning, everyone. During the third quarter, we continued to grow the number of loyal households, and our loyal household count grew at a much faster rate than total household growth, which, incidentally, was also up for the quarter. \r\nLoyal household growth is an important measure of our business because it lets us know how well we are connecting with our best customers. Inflation increased in the third quarter, as Rodney mentioned, among commodities such as meat and pharmacy and increased to a lesser extent in all other supermarket departments. \r\nAs Mike Schlotman will discuss shortly, we raised our LIFO charge estimate for the year again this quarter due to the higher-than-expected inflation. We estimate inflation was 3.5%, excluding fuel, for the third quarter. Even so, we saw strong tonnage growth in the third quarter compared to last year. And in fact, it was slightly ahead of the second quarter's unit growth. \r\nCorporate Brands had an outstanding third quarter, representing 27.3% of total units sold and 25.8% of sales dollars, excluding fuel and pharmacy. In fact, Corporate Brands experienced its highest sales growth and total retail dollar share of any quarter in the last 3 years. So clearly, our rebranding -- rebranded opening price point in Kroger banner brands are a hit with our customers. \r\nSimple Truth and Simple Truth Organics continued to earn double-digit unit and sales growth. A key driver of Kroger's sustainable growth is Customer 1st innovation. For the past few quarters, we have been highlighting innovations that are improving our connection with customers. \r\nThis quarter, I will highlight some of the new and exciting work of our manufacturing team in the dairy department. We recently opened a state-of-the-art dairy processing plant in Denver. We built and engineered the plant to deliver exceptional quality and freshness for our customers and to provide an avenue for innovation in the dairy category. We incorporated new technologies for our customers that ensure our milk will stay fresher longer than ever before. \r\nWe are the first dairy in the U.S. to deploy robotic technology that enables us to pack cases and pick and palletize orders entirely by automation. Another innovation that this dairy will bring is the ability for us to produce long shelf life products to meet growing demand for aseptic products and packaging. \r\nThe dairy, our first ground-up manufacturing plant of any kind in 20 years, opened in May and began full production of fresh milk in August. We have been producing fresh milk, organic milk, juices and drinks, and customer response has been very, very positive. \r\nNow I'd like to give a brief update on labor relations. We recently completed several successful contract negotiations covering Smith's associates in New Mexico, Fry's and Smith's associates in Arizona, Food 4 Less associates in Southern California and Kroger associates in Toledo, West Virginia and the Ohio Valley. \r\nWe are currently negotiating with the Teamsters covering several distribution and manufacturing facilities. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages; good quality, affordable health care; and retirement benefits for our associates. Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension cost, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger and the local unions, which represent many of our associates, should have a shared objective: growing Kroger's business and profitably, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for all of our associates. \r\nBefore I turn it over to Mike Schlotman, I'd like to thank our associates for the impressive quarter. Once again, you showed our customers how much we care about them, and each and every day, you continue to deliver. Because of your efforts, we are able to continue investing in our products, lowering prices and improving the shopping experience in ways that generate customer loyalty. \r\nNow Mike will offer more detail on our financial results and our guidance for the remainder of the year. Mike?\n\n---\n\nThanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. As you know, when we outlined our growth strategy in 2012, we identified the key performance targets for our shareholders to measure our progress. I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing the results in each metric. \r\nOur first metric is identical supermarket sales without fuel. Identical sales performance is the best measure of our growing connection with customers over time. \r\nWe're very pleased with our third quarter ID sales growth of 5.6% without fuel. This strong performance was supported by ID sales growth in every supermarket department and division, and our natural foods department continues to lead with double-digit growth. Rolling 4 quarters FIFO operating margin, excluding fuel and adjustment items, expanded by 9 basis points. This exceeded our goal of slightly -- to slightly expand FIFO operating margin without fuel on a rolling 4 quarters basis. \r\nWe are not reporting our third metric, return on invested capital, this quarter because the calculation would actually overstate our result. We expect our year-end return on invested capital, which will fully reflect Harris Teeter in our calculation, to be similar to our return on invested capital at the end of fiscal 2013. \r\nNow I'll share the rest of our third quarter 2014 results in more detail. Please note that this quarter includes Harris Teeter in Kroger's consolidated results of operations. Year-over-year percentage comparisons are affected as a result. \r\nIn the third quarter, our net earnings totaled $362 million or $0.73 per diluted share. This includes a $0.04 benefit in the third quarter due to certain tax items. \r\nExcluding these items, Kroger's adjusted net earnings were $345 million or $0.69 per diluted share for the third quarter. We view these tax benefits as nonrecurring. So as you begin to think about 2015, please note that we will not be growing off of that next year. \r\nNet earnings in the same period last year were $299 million or $0.57 per diluted share. Last year's third quarter net earnings per diluted share benefited from certain adjustments totaling $0.04 per diluted share. Excluding these adjustments, last year's third quarter net earnings were $0.53 per diluted share. \r\nWe recorded an $85 million LIFO charge during the quarter compared to a $13 million LIFO charge in the same quarter last year, resulting in an incremental $0.09 per diluted share charge to net earnings in the third quarter compared to the same quarter of last year. We began fiscal 2014 estimating a LIFO charge for the year at $55 million. \r\nAt the end of the first quarter, we increased our LIFO guidance to a charge of $90 million, and at the end of the second quarter, we increased our LIFO charge estimate for the year to $100 million. As reported this morning, we have again increased our LIFO charge estimate for the year to $180 million. \r\nFIFO [ph] gross margin decreased 2 basis points from the same period last year, excluding retail fuel operations. Operating, general and administrative costs plus rent depreciation, excluding retail fuel operations and the adjustment items, decreased 21 basis points as a percent of sales compared with the prior year as a result of good expense control and strong sales leverage. \r\nNow for retail fuel operations. In the third quarter, our cents-per-gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.232 compared to $0.171 in the same quarter last year. This does not include debit and credit card fees. \r\nLast year's third quarter margin was well above historical averages, which means this quarter's margin performance was remarkable. Our long-term financial strategy continues to be to maintain our current investment grade debt rating, repurchase shares, have an increasing dividend and fund increasing capital expenditures. \r\nAchieving a 2 to 2.2 net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio by mid to late 2015 remains a key objective. Kroger took on debt to finance the Harris Teeter merger and has yet not realized the full year Harris Teeter EBITDA. As a result, the company's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio increased to 2.29 as of the close of the third quarter compared to 1.86 during the same period last year, as described in Table 5 of our press release. This is an improvement of -- from the 2.33 reported last quarter. \r\nKroger's net total debt is $11.5 billion, an increase of $3.4 billion from a year ago, including the debt related to Harris Teeter transaction and Kroger's share repurchase program. Kroger's strong financial position allowed the company to return more than $1.8 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends over the last 4 quarters. \r\nDuring the third quarter, Kroger repurchased 600,000 common shares for a total investment of $29 million. All $500 million of the buyback authorization granted in June remains available. \r\nCapital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, totaled $681 million for the third quarter compared to $641 million for the same period last year. We expect capital investments to be at the low end of the $2.8 billion to $3 billion range, including Harris Teeter, for fiscal 2014. \r\nNow I'd like to review our updated growth objectives for fiscal 2014. Based on our strong third quarter results, we raised and narrowed our adjusted net earnings per diluted share guidance to a range of $3.32 to $3.36 for fiscal 2014. The previous guidance was $3.22 to $3.28 per diluted share. \r\nFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, Kroger expects identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, of approximately 4% to 5%. We acknowledge this is a wide range for one quarter, and we are seeing great strength and momentum at the start of the fourth quarter, but this year's fourth quarter is difficult to project narrowly because of the uncertainties relative to a year ago, including the positive effect that weather had on our identical supermarket sales during last year's fourth quarter. \r\nAs you start to think about fiscal 2015 estimates, we encourage you to build your models based on fiscal 2014 adjusted results, which exclude certain tax benefits and charges related to the restructuring of certain pension plan agreements. If fuel margins return to historical levels, we expect 2015 results to be closer to the low end of our long-term net earnings per diluted share growth rate guidance of 8% to 11%, and shareholder return will be further enhanced by a dividend expected to increase over time. \r\nNow I'll return it back to Rodney.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Mike. Our third quarter performance is further evidence that Kroger is improving our connection with customers and delivering growth for our shareholders. We continue to increase capital investments, which creates exciting opportunities for our business and for our associates. We enjoyed discussing several of those opportunities with you during our investor conference in October. Our positive momentum is expected to carry through to the fourth quarter and sets us up well as we look to 2015. More importantly, Kroger's to-do list remains longer than our done list. There is a lot more to come. \r\nNow we will look forward to your questions.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Cindy Holmes (Executives)】\nThank you, Emily. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially.\r\nA detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information.\r\nBoth our third quarter press release, which includes a reconciliation of certain non-GAAP measures discussed today, and our prepared remarks in this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] \r\nThanks, again, to those who participated in our October investor conference in person or via webcast. We appreciate that many of you made the trip to Cincinnati, and as always, we enjoyed the dialogue and the opportunity to show you our stores. \r\nI will now turn the call over to Rodney McMullen, Kroger's Chief Executive Officer.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nThank you, Cindy, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's third quarter 2014 results are Mike Ellis, Kroger's President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Schlotman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\r\nKroger continues to deliver consistently remarkable results. We are well on our way to achieving our 10th consecutive year of lowering costs and reinvesting those savings in our people, products, pricing and improved store experience, which together are driving our growth. Few can deliver this level of sustainable high performance. \r\nAfter a while, it can be easy to take this consistency and reliability for granted. So it's important to keep in mind that these results are possible only because 375,000 associates engage with our customers every single day. \r\nOur associates delivered yet another quality quarter of inspired Customer 1st performance. We continue to implement our growth strategy and consistently deliver on the key performance indicators we first outlined in October 2012. \r\nIn the third quarter, we achieved our 44th consecutive quarter of positive identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel. We exceeded our goal to slightly expand FIFO operating margin without fuel on a rolling 4-quarter basis, and we continued to gain market share. \r\nOur third quarter financial results were driven by strong sales and core business performance, which was better than we expected. Higher fuel margins drove our results above our previous guidance range. \r\nOur guidance range for the full year assumes fuel margins will not be as strong in the fourth quarter as they were in the third quarter. Mike Schlotman will have more to say about our supermarket fuel operations in a few minutes. \r\nHow our customers are doing today depends on the stability of their family finances. Overall, our customers continue to spend a little more as confidence in the economy improves over time. While inflation is apparent in certain commodities, fuel prices have been going down, which helps all customers, especially those on a budget. We try to help those customers stretch their food budget in a variety of ways. Our weekly promotions and fuel rewards help, along with price investments. \r\nWe continue to make natural and organic foods affordable and accessible to all customers, especially with Simple Truth. Our expansive corporate brands offering is resonating with customers seeking high-quality food at very good prices. \r\nIn fact, our Corporate Brands had their best performance in several years in the third quarter. Our ability to deliver this combination of value sets us apart. \r\nNow I will turn it over to Mike Ellis to discuss our operational performance in the third quarter. Mike?\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Michael Ellis (Executives)】\nThanks, Rodney. Good morning, everyone. During the third quarter, we continued to grow the number of loyal households, and our loyal household count grew at a much faster rate than total household growth, which, incidentally, was also up for the quarter. \r\nLoyal household growth is an important measure of our business because it lets us know how well we are connecting with our best customers. Inflation increased in the third quarter, as Rodney mentioned, among commodities such as meat and pharmacy and increased to a lesser extent in all other supermarket departments. \r\nAs Mike Schlotman will discuss shortly, we raised our LIFO charge estimate for the year again this quarter due to the higher-than-expected inflation. We estimate inflation was 3.5%, excluding fuel, for the third quarter. Even so, we saw strong tonnage growth in the third quarter compared to last year. And in fact, it was slightly ahead of the second quarter's unit growth. \r\nCorporate Brands had an outstanding third quarter, representing 27.3% of total units sold and 25.8% of sales dollars, excluding fuel and pharmacy. In fact, Corporate Brands experienced its highest sales growth and total retail dollar share of any quarter in the last 3 years. So clearly, our rebranding -- rebranded opening price point in Kroger banner brands are a hit with our customers. \r\nSimple Truth and Simple Truth Organics continued to earn double-digit unit and sales growth. A key driver of Kroger's sustainable growth is Customer 1st innovation. For the past few quarters, we have been highlighting innovations that are improving our connection with customers. \r\nThis quarter, I will highlight some of the new and exciting work of our manufacturing team in the dairy department. We recently opened a state-of-the-art dairy processing plant in Denver. We built and engineered the plant to deliver exceptional quality and freshness for our customers and to provide an avenue for innovation in the dairy category. We incorporated new technologies for our customers that ensure our milk will stay fresher longer than ever before. \r\nWe are the first dairy in the U.S. to deploy robotic technology that enables us to pack cases and pick and palletize orders entirely by automation. Another innovation that this dairy will bring is the ability for us to produce long shelf life products to meet growing demand for aseptic products and packaging. \r\nThe dairy, our first ground-up manufacturing plant of any kind in 20 years, opened in May and began full production of fresh milk in August. We have been producing fresh milk, organic milk, juices and drinks, and customer response has been very, very positive. \r\nNow I'd like to give a brief update on labor relations. We recently completed several successful contract negotiations covering Smith's associates in New Mexico, Fry's and Smith's associates in Arizona, Food 4 Less associates in Southern California and Kroger associates in Toledo, West Virginia and the Ohio Valley. \r\nWe are currently negotiating with the Teamsters covering several distribution and manufacturing facilities. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages; good quality, affordable health care; and retirement benefits for our associates. Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension cost, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger and the local unions, which represent many of our associates, should have a shared objective: growing Kroger's business and profitably, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for all of our associates. \r\nBefore I turn it over to Mike Schlotman, I'd like to thank our associates for the impressive quarter. Once again, you showed our customers how much we care about them, and each and every day, you continue to deliver. Because of your efforts, we are able to continue investing in our products, lowering prices and improving the shopping experience in ways that generate customer loyalty. \r\nNow Mike will offer more detail on our financial results and our guidance for the remainder of the year. Mike?\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nThanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. As you know, when we outlined our growth strategy in 2012, we identified the key performance targets for our shareholders to measure our progress. I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing the results in each metric. \r\nOur first metric is identical supermarket sales without fuel. Identical sales performance is the best measure of our growing connection with customers over time. \r\nWe're very pleased with our third quarter ID sales growth of 5.6% without fuel. This strong performance was supported by ID sales growth in every supermarket department and division, and our natural foods department continues to lead with double-digit growth. Rolling 4 quarters FIFO operating margin, excluding fuel and adjustment items, expanded by 9 basis points. This exceeded our goal of slightly -- to slightly expand FIFO operating margin without fuel on a rolling 4 quarters basis. \r\nWe are not reporting our third metric, return on invested capital, this quarter because the calculation would actually overstate our result. We expect our year-end return on invested capital, which will fully reflect Harris Teeter in our calculation, to be similar to our return on invested capital at the end of fiscal 2013. \r\nNow I'll share the rest of our third quarter 2014 results in more detail. Please note that this quarter includes Harris Teeter in Kroger's consolidated results of operations. Year-over-year percentage comparisons are affected as a result. \r\nIn the third quarter, our net earnings totaled $362 million or $0.73 per diluted share. This includes a $0.04 benefit in the third quarter due to certain tax items. \r\nExcluding these items, Kroger's adjusted net earnings were $345 million or $0.69 per diluted share for the third quarter. We view these tax benefits as nonrecurring. So as you begin to think about 2015, please note that we will not be growing off of that next year. \r\nNet earnings in the same period last year were $299 million or $0.57 per diluted share. Last year's third quarter net earnings per diluted share benefited from certain adjustments totaling $0.04 per diluted share. Excluding these adjustments, last year's third quarter net earnings were $0.53 per diluted share. \r\nWe recorded an $85 million LIFO charge during the quarter compared to a $13 million LIFO charge in the same quarter last year, resulting in an incremental $0.09 per diluted share charge to net earnings in the third quarter compared to the same quarter of last year. We began fiscal 2014 estimating a LIFO charge for the year at $55 million. \r\nAt the end of the first quarter, we increased our LIFO guidance to a charge of $90 million, and at the end of the second quarter, we increased our LIFO charge estimate for the year to $100 million. As reported this morning, we have again increased our LIFO charge estimate for the year to $180 million. \r\nFIFO [ph] gross margin decreased 2 basis points from the same period last year, excluding retail fuel operations. Operating, general and administrative costs plus rent depreciation, excluding retail fuel operations and the adjustment items, decreased 21 basis points as a percent of sales compared with the prior year as a result of good expense control and strong sales leverage. \r\nNow for retail fuel operations. In the third quarter, our cents-per-gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.232 compared to $0.171 in the same quarter last year. This does not include debit and credit card fees. \r\nLast year's third quarter margin was well above historical averages, which means this quarter's margin performance was remarkable. Our long-term financial strategy continues to be to maintain our current investment grade debt rating, repurchase shares, have an increasing dividend and fund increasing capital expenditures. \r\nAchieving a 2 to 2.2 net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio by mid to late 2015 remains a key objective. Kroger took on debt to finance the Harris Teeter merger and has yet not realized the full year Harris Teeter EBITDA. As a result, the company's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio increased to 2.29 as of the close of the third quarter compared to 1.86 during the same period last year, as described in Table 5 of our press release. This is an improvement of -- from the 2.33 reported last quarter. \r\nKroger's net total debt is $11.5 billion, an increase of $3.4 billion from a year ago, including the debt related to Harris Teeter transaction and Kroger's share repurchase program. Kroger's strong financial position allowed the company to return more than $1.8 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends over the last 4 quarters. \r\nDuring the third quarter, Kroger repurchased 600,000 common shares for a total investment of $29 million. All $500 million of the buyback authorization granted in June remains available. \r\nCapital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, totaled $681 million for the third quarter compared to $641 million for the same period last year. We expect capital investments to be at the low end of the $2.8 billion to $3 billion range, including Harris Teeter, for fiscal 2014. \r\nNow I'd like to review our updated growth objectives for fiscal 2014. Based on our strong third quarter results, we raised and narrowed our adjusted net earnings per diluted share guidance to a range of $3.32 to $3.36 for fiscal 2014. The previous guidance was $3.22 to $3.28 per diluted share. \r\nFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, Kroger expects identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, of approximately 4% to 5%. We acknowledge this is a wide range for one quarter, and we are seeing great strength and momentum at the start of the fourth quarter, but this year's fourth quarter is difficult to project narrowly because of the uncertainties relative to a year ago, including the positive effect that weather had on our identical supermarket sales during last year's fourth quarter. \r\nAs you start to think about fiscal 2015 estimates, we encourage you to build your models based on fiscal 2014 adjusted results, which exclude certain tax benefits and charges related to the restructuring of certain pension plan agreements. If fuel margins return to historical levels, we expect 2015 results to be closer to the low end of our long-term net earnings per diluted share growth rate guidance of 8% to 11%, and shareholder return will be further enhanced by a dividend expected to increase over time. \r\nNow I'll return it back to Rodney.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nThanks, Mike. Our third quarter performance is further evidence that Kroger is improving our connection with customers and delivering growth for our shareholders. We continue to increase capital investments, which creates exciting opportunities for our business and for our associates. We enjoyed discussing several of those opportunities with you during our investor conference in October. Our positive momentum is expected to carry through to the fourth quarter and sets us up well as we look to 2015. More importantly, Kroger's to-do list remains longer than our done list. There is a lot more to come. \r\nNow we will look forward to your questions.",
      "transcript_text3": "Just a couple of questions regarding your guidance and, I guess, also this quarter. So obviously, gas margins more than offset the higher LIFO charge this quarter, and this year has been an incredible year from an earnings growth perspective. But I guess, what my question is, looking to next year, Mike, you talked about the lower end of the range of earnings growth. And I understand you're coming off of a very strong year. So my question for this current year is, was the strength more in overachieving on the Harris Teeter accretion side? Or was it broad-based across the core and Harris Teeter? And I guess that would lead me to, if it was broad-based across -- or if it was more Harris Teeter related, that explains why you might be at the lower end of the 8% to 11% next year. But if it was broad-based across Harris Teeter and the core, are you just being conservative for next year, even though this year was incredibly strong?\n\n---\n\nWow. There was like 3 or 4 questions in there. Which way do I go with the answer? Well, fundamentally, this has been a very strong year across the board for us with the ID sales that we've had so far this year and ID -- positive ID sales in every department and positive ID sales in every geography. Our core business is performing extremely well. It's not just incremental accretion from Harris Teeter, it's strong results from all of our core operations. The primary reason for the conversation about being at the low end of 8% to 11% for next year is solely where fuel is at $0.23 for the quarter. And really, the last 2 quarters have been well above historical averages with the amount of fuel gallons we sell and that kind of outperformance on historical fuel margins. We just wanted people to be aware as they start thinking about 2015 of that potential headwind. If you were to kind of take the business apart and look at our core operations for 2015, they would perform extremely well inside the 8% to 11% range, and it's really just a headwind from a potential lower fuel margin per gallon for next year.\n\n---\n\nAnd is it fair to say that Harris Teeter has come in slightly better than expected for the year so far?\n\n---\n\nYes, I would characterize Harris Teeter as performing how we expected them to perform. We've -- as has been widely publicized, they've not been shy about advertising it. We've made the price investments in their business that we expected to make during the year. The customers are responding to those price investments, and I would characterize Harris Teeter as right on track with what our expectations would be relative to our overall guidance for the year.\n\n---\n\nThe Harris Teeter team has done a nice job of running their own business, but the other thing is they've been incredibly helpful helping teach all of Kroger some ideas as well. So it's been great so far, and the synergy's moving along as we expected as well.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then, just last question. On next year's earnings growth, what's embedded in terms of share buybacks?\n\n---\n\nWe'll give full guidance in March. We just know that at this time of the year, with 3 quarters behind us, clearer fourth quarter guidance, since we only have one quarter left, people start to refine their 2015 estimates. And we just wanted to give some insight of our view of a percentage growth rate and where we would expect to fall in that range as you all start to prepare your estimates for 2015 or refine those estimates. But we'll wait until we give full guidance in March. We feel we've gone far enough with the EPS because our board has its annual business plan review meeting in January, and it's probably better served to let them approve our business plan for next year before I give you too many lines.\n\n---\n\nIt's actually Steve Forbes on for John today. Regarding gas, so we've historically found it difficult to find any real correlation between gas prices and comps. What are you seeing during the most recent period since these declines? I know you've recently touched on it before. But is there any particular region to call out? You mentioned the low -- lower-income consumer. Or is there any demographic that you can expand on as well?\n\n---\n\nThe -- if you look at our own numbers, we would have difficulty finding some of the same correlations. When gas prices go up, our fuel reward program has a little bit more strength. As gas prices go down, people have more money to spend. So as you know, when we look at fuel, we just look at one more service that we're offering the customer and one more reason to come to Kroger. The comments that we made -- that Mike and I both made, we continue to see improvement in the economy. It's slow, but it's going in the right direction, and it's really across all customers. But if you look at mainstream and up, those customers have fully recovered. The customers that are on a budget are improving, but it's much slower and more constrained.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then just on the deployment of these windfalls, is there -- I'm sure there's thoughts around how to invest these benefits. But do they occur too quickly in order to appropriately plan for the deployment? Or is it just better to let it flow through to the bottom line? How do you guys think about these onetime or short-term benefits?\n\n---\n\nWell, if you look at like the tax settlements and stuff, we just let those, for the most part, be when they are. And we just disclose it to let you know what it is. And it flows to the bottom line, but it's onetime. If it's things that we think are things that are sustainable, those are the things that we would look at in terms of continuing to invest in the business from a service standpoint and a price standpoint. But it's -- as you mentioned, it's always a balance between those 2 pieces, and we are always focused on what's going on in the marketplace and what do we think is the best use of that opportunity when it happens. So it doesn't answer your question directly because the answer's actually different depending on what we see the opportunities to be.\n\n---\n\nJudah on for Ed. You mentioned in the release and also on the call the kind of rolling 4-quarter x fuel operating margin being a little bit stronger than you expected it to be. I mean, is that a way of saying you would have liked to maybe invest more in price? Or how should we kind of translate that?\n\n---\n\nI don't think it's a reflection of having -- wanting to invest more in price. It's really a reflection of having Harris Teeter in for a portion of the year and not all year compared to results last year that didn't have Harris Teeter in the numbers. And I would say that's the same thing for the -- just a couple of basis points decline in the gross margin number I talked about. If you were to strip Harris Teeter out of the prior year, you would have seen a much bigger amount that we have invested in, in price to continue to give value to our customers, but it's really that -- the fact that their historical numbers have been higher than ours, and it's the mention of those together that's driving some unusual comparisons. We've continued right on track with what our expectations were for investment in all 4 keys of our Customer 1st Strategy, not just price, but the people, the products and the shopping experience as well, and continue to be very pleased with the reaction our customers have with those investments.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And if I could just sneak one more in there, maybe shifting gears. On natural organic, it sounds like it's still comping really well. You've mentioned, in the past, maybe eventually seeing some margin compression in the category. And now that you have one of the bigger players in this space with a national ad campaign out there highlighting value, have you seen anything in kind of the near term on margins there?\n\n---\n\nI haven't really seen margin pressure overall. We continue to invest in price where we feel appropriate, and the customer really drives our pricing strategy for the most part. But again, we had strong sales growth and double-digit growth in national organics. And to go back to our Simple Truth brand, which will hit $1 billion this year, we're really proud of where that's going and what it's contributing.\n\n---\n\nI also wanted to ask a bit more on the natural organic. Obviously, Simple Truth continues to perform very well. But can you also give us a little color on how some of the other categories and products within natural organic are doing? And maybe touch upon, also, some of the Vitacost products?\n\n---\n\nWell, in natural foods, the expansion of item selection is continuing to grow. And you're finding more and more products in the dairy category. We just introduced a new line, the Simple Truth lunchmeats. So there's a lot of activity. And we're still finding so many of our customers that didn't shop natural foods are beginning to migrate over to that business, which has been really, really good for us. On the Vitacost piece, we're still in a honeymoon. It's only been a couple of month since we merged with Vitacost, and there's a lot of work going on, but we have big plans for Vitacost, and we're excited about the merger. I've been to the facilities, down to their offices, to their warehouses, and it's a great business that we have. And we're excited about where we're going to go into next year.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Great. And just a follow-up, if I may. Regarding your relationship, the dunnhumby relationship, as you continue to have nice growth in your loyal households and loyal customers, I know that part of what you're looking at is also not only continuing to have your current loyal customers purchase more, but also convert others into being loyal customers. Can you talk about any -- if there are any either new strategies or learnings that you're finding as you're going through?\n\n---\n\nIf you look at all of our data insights, and dunnhumby that you referenced is obviously one piece of that, but there's a lot of other insights, you're continually getting insights and testing things. And the things that work, you do more of, and the ones that don't work, you stop doing. And that never stops. So it's an ongoing basis in terms of trying to understand customer needs. So if you think about your earlier question on natural and organics, well, that's some insights from our customers. But one of the things our customers are very clear is they don't want to have to pay a premium for natural and organics, and we're trying to make sure that we have where they can get a good-quality product at a price that's comparable to the nonorganic brands and, in some cases, actually the same price. So it's, really, that would just be one example, but there's a whole host of things where you're continually trying to get insights, insights on actually where to locate stores. It's broad parts of our business, and it's actually getting that insight and using it is the key.\n\n---\n\nSo I just wanted to just touch on inflation. Clearly, you had a nice benefit in inflation this quarter. I just want to see if you guys can share, maybe, your early thoughts for inflation for the upcoming year.\n\n---\n\nAs we sit here today, we would actually expect -- I'm always hesitant to go here because I've proven my inability to predict this with the fluctuations we have on our LIFO charge, which is tied to inflation, but we would expect inflation next year to be a little bit more moderate than it is this year. Clearly, the protein categories don't really show any signs of letting up on inflation. Chicken may happen if corn prices stay down at some point, but beef and pork, we would expect to see probably close to double-digit inflation again next year. Milk, at this point, again, as you know, the milk prices are driven by federal market order. As we sit here today, it looks like they may come in some, which would help a lot of categories next year. But overall, just given where some of the core input categories are, it looks like we should be a little bit lower than the 3.5% that's out there. That said, embedded in that 3.5% is pharmaceuticals, which continue to have -- particularly in the generic category, which has not always been the case, which continue to have quite high inflation in them.\n\n---\n\nOne of the things that we think is important, when you look at inflation over the last 10 years, Kroger's been able to really manage in all inflationary environments, whether there's been deflation or inflation. There's always a transition if it suddenly changes quickly, very high or very low, to manage that transition. But over time, we've found that we really -- our associates have the ability to manage in all environments.\n\n---\n\nOkay. That's helpful. And then maybe just shifting gear to your ID sales. Do you feel -- as you look at your IDs this quarter, do you feel that you're maybe winning new customers maybe at an accelerated pace from earlier this year?\n\n---\n\nThe thing that's exciting, and Mike mentioned it in his prepared comments, we're seeing good growth with our existing customers, but we're also seeing new loyal shoppers. And so it's really balanced across both, and that's one of the things exciting. And it's been -- it's a little bit higher now than earlier in the year, but it was strong earlier in the year, as well. I don't know, Mike, if you want to add anything.\n\n---\n\nNo. I think you hit it. It's just -- it's been solid, yes. Thanks, Rodney.\n\n---\n\nMine's actually much more of a kind of strategic, long-term question and just trying to understand kind of the growth trajectory of the company. You guys were nice enough to take us to a Marketplace store, I think, that was converted from a regular grocery store. And it seems like that conversion has gone quite well. So I guess I'm just trying to understand. It seems, as we think about Kroger, that in a lot of ways, you have a better mousetrap at this stage, and that Marketplace store is certainly one of the key elements. You guys went through -- and this goes way back in the, I think, late '60s, early '70s, into a big kind of store upgrade cycle, and you became a good to great stock in Jim Collins' work. I mean, how close are we to really getting into a big upgrade cycle on your store fleet where you really deploy Marketplace in a much more aggressive way? So that's my first question about long-term growth.\n\n---\n\nWell, as you know, when you were out in October, we're obviously very excited about the Marketplace stores and the use of all our formats together. It's one of the reasons why, a couple of years ago, we committed and -- to increase our capital investment by $200 million a year, and we continue to do that. We think that's a good amount to accelerate capital by in terms of the ability to operate the store at the level that you saw and balance in terms of the use of the cash flow. As long as -- as we continue to get the performance from those stores as we expect, you'll see it to continue accelerating that capital investment. But that was the reason why, in October of '12, we outlined the need to increase capital by $200 million a year. I don't know, Mike, if you want to...\n\n---\n\nNo, I would agree with that, and it's -- we -- as you know, Scott, we continue to expect increased capital over the next several years by incremental amounts. I -- if there's one disappointment I have so far this year, it's that -- actually, that we're at the low end of our CapEx guidance. I know some people out there think we spend too much on CapEx, but that just means some stores aren't coming out of the ground as quickly as we had hoped. It doesn't mean that we're less bullish on the new stores we're opening. It's just a matter of timing of those projects, and they will get caught up. So we're very bullish on our ability to continue to open new stores and have them perform very well.\n\n---\n\nOne other comment. We have Marketplace stores now in just about every division of our company across the country, and the success we're having with the Marketplace store has been really pleasing. But you asked about remerchandising, and I know you saw apparel in some of our stores now. We're having some success in -- with some of these new brands, some of the new products we're putting in. So we continue to work on the model to make it relevant to the customer, but we're really pleased with what we have today.\n\n---\n\nAnd as a follow-up -- I mean, any thought process as to how many stores in the store fleet could eventually be Marketplace?\n\n---\n\nWe probably do, but probably not for public consumption at this point, Scott. The other thing to keep in mind is, as we go down this path, and you'll probably see it a little clearer as we get into next year, we continue to invest in our business. And a fundamental piece of being able to invest in our business is continuing to generate a really good return on our new investments. And some of those dollars, we make conscious decisions of how many fall to the bottom line and how many we invest back into the business and the people, product, shopping experience and price. And while I know a lot of you would think that we should be at the end of investing in price, we still see plenty of categories and particular sections of the store where we have an opportunity to be more price competitive than we are today. So we're, in some respects, counting on that continued good results from that deployment of capital to both increase to have the 8% to 11% earnings per share growth and have the dollars generated to invest back in our business.\n\n---\n\nAnd then I just had one more, and then I'll yield. And it goes to the long-term growth again. M&A, we talked about it at the Analyst Day. It seems, again, Kroger, better mousetrap, fuel program, dunnhumby, customer insights, Marketplace store. It seems, as you guys evaluate -- at least from my perspective, evaluate M&A activity, there's almost a checklist of what you might want out of a company that you were going to acquire. But it does seem like it's a little bit different now, given the success you have with your business. Any thoughts, any additional thoughts? Again, I know asked this at the Analyst Day, but I wanted to revisit it.\n\n---\n\nYes, I wouldn't say that there's anything much different than what we answered. As we talked about then, one of the keys on any merger, how's the -- how are the people that run the business? And do we think, culturally, they have the same values we have? And that's one of the reasons why we always talk about mergers rather than acquisition. You get a more limited number of opportunities when you have that standard, but what we find is, when people have that standard, they like it going the other direction, as well. And we always like to point out the fact that 2 of our last 3 CEOs came out of one of our merged companies and several of our senior officers.\n\n---\n\nAnd our current President...\n\n---\n\nYes, came out of one of the merged companies. So I think you're right when you say it's almost a checklist because it is, but it's something that's really worked well for us.\n\n---\n\nAnd Scott, something I would add to that. And I certainly understand your question and the seeming benefits we could bring to some M&A activity that may be not as strong as we may hope or not have everything on our checklist. When you sit back and you have opportunity x and you look around the organization as a company in our geographies where we are today, and you can clearly see where you can double market share in specific geographies by deploying new capital in those geographies. And you have a base of people and a recognition in that market and already strong customer acceptance. We typically default to that fill-in strategy that we talked about because it's a much surer thing, takes a lot less time and energy of the organization, has significantly less management distraction. And we're perfectly willing to sit and almost wait, not necessarily troll around the country for those opportunities to come long like the Harris Teeter did.\n\n---\n\nThe other thing that would be needed for us to change our approach is if we find that we're able to develop talent faster than we can use it within our existing growth where -- because if we bought something that was something that needed to be fixed up, we would obviously need to figure out a way to put talent into it in a way that was effective. And that would require a different level of talent than we're producing today because we're really focused on developing the talent to support the growth we have.\n\n---\n\nCould you give us a little perspective on just how much the gas gain was in EPS terms? And what quarter should we really think about the headwinds starting to arrive as you lap the stronger margins from last year?\n\n---\n\nYes. We -- Mark, we won't go into the benefit of the EPS benefit. But if you think about a $0.23 fuel margin and $0.17 last year, you get a feel -- we talked about, in a lot of places, the number of gallons that we pump. So you should be able to back into a number that gets you relatively close. We just don't want to -- we think about that department as any other department inside the company, and it happens to be performing very well right now. I would say, clearly, the second and third quarter of next year, if margins revert to a more historical kind of level, would start to experience some headwind from lower fuel margins. Again, we didn't say \"when\" in the comments purposefully. We said \"if\" because nobody can really predict where it is. And we typically turn fuel a lot faster than our competitors. So in down cycles, that's good. In up cycles, that's bad. So if fuel were to turn the other way and -- or oil was to turn the other way and start going up, that actually creates an incremental headwind, not just a normal headwind, because we're turning the fuel so quickly. But clearly, second and third quarter.\n\n---\n\nAnd one of the things, as Mike mentioned earlier, we have a January meeting with our board for them to actually approve our '15 plan. Normally, we would not share '15 details until the fourth quarter earnings release, but we just thought it would be helpful to give a little bit of color on what we're thinking and what we're seeing before then for next year.\n\n---\n\nThat's fair. And then, on the inflation in those meat categories where you're still seeing that double-digit inflation, are you passing all that through? Because we are hearing some other retailers are having some difficulty passing it through.\n\n---\n\nWell, inflation for us -- inflation and deflation come and go all the time, and we're constantly dealing with pricing and how do we continue to give value to the customer through inflation and deflation, whether it's meat, produce or any other part of our business. So we try to manage it in a way that still gives great value to the customer, and the customer decides what they're going to pay. But I can tell you our tonnage is good, and inflation is extremely high right now. And we're just trying to really manage our way through it.\n\n---\n\nAs you think about just the broader industry, I was hoping you could just talk maybe about where you think some of the gains that you're getting are coming from, how you see that evolving. I think it was at an Analyst Day a few years back where you discussed some of the regional players ceding share pretty consistently. Are you seeing that accelerate? Or is there anything else that you can just talk to broadly?\n\n---\n\nIt's -- as you know, we don't ever talk about specific competitors. In terms of where the market share is coming from, it's always easier to ask the question than it is to see. It looks pretty broad-based in terms of where it's coming from, but we see, at some other national players, they are gaining share as well. So we're not the only one. But there's still about half of the market that's out there that's not people with our economies of scale, and it's not necessarily just small regional people. Some of them could be a little bit bigger. And then the other piece is we continue to add categories that we didn't even have before, which is helping some of our growth.\n\n---\n\nThat's helpful. And then, are you seeing any difference in terms of the comp performance by the format of your stores? And do you feel like, after so many years of positive ID growth or productivity growth, that you're hitting a ceiling in any of these?\n\n---\n\nIt's a good question. It's -- if you look at the comps, you always have pockets that are better than others, but it's very broad-based. And when you look at age and other things, obviously, newer stores will have a higher comp than older stores. But outside of that, there's nothing that would cause us to say one thing or the other. And probably -- I'm sure we have some stores that are getting close to capacity, but as a general rule, we have plenty of capacity within our existing stores to continue to increase the business.\n\n---\n\nJust wanted to ask about the guidance for the fourth quarter for IDs. You mentioned the difficulty in forecasting when you cycle that benefit from the winter weather last year. I'm just curious if you are able to or have been able to at all look at your data and use dunnhumby and see how much of that boost that you may have had last year was from existing or loyal customers versus new customers and if there's any strategies in place to help kind of cycle that benefit that you may have had last winter.\n\n---\n\nWell, clearly, we can understand where that business is coming from, and in those -- in regions where the snow or the weather is going to be -- get volatile in a big way, you get a lot of people from all spectrums of the loyalty umbrella, if you will, from people who rarely shop with you, but they come to you because you might be the one that is on stock on product, to your most loyal customers who come in and stock up. Obviously, we aren't -- for the fourth quarter, Mike Donnelly and Robert Clark and their merchandising group isn't sitting back just hoping for weather for us to be able to cycle the great sales we had last year's fourth quarter. They know what days and what weeks there was weather, and they would have strategies in place to try to cover some of the uplift we had in the -- from that snow. But the amount of incremental volume you get in a 36-hour period from snow is phenomenal, and it would be a Herculean effort on their part to be able to come up with strategies to overcome all of it. Clearly, we're going to go do our best to overcome it the best we can. We'll have weather. We don't know when. We don't know where. We don't know what day. We don't know...\n\n---\n\nOr how much.\n\n---\n\nWe don't know if it'll be by the end of January. We don't know if it'll be in February, March at the beginning of the next year. But it happens every year. You just don't know when.\n\n---\n\nYes, the other thing is, when you look at the weather, I have a couple of friends that own quite a few fast food restaurants. And they will -- they always tell me that they hate snow because it actually has the opposite effect on them. So it's actually some of our increase is getting business that customers would sometimes be going to other channels. And obviously, when kids stay home, they're eating at home versus eating at school. So some of it is just switching where somebody eats.\n\n---\n\nRight.\n\n---\n\nGot it. That's helpful. And then just another question on gross margin. Your FIFO gross margin x fuel only down 2 basis points in spite of some of the high inflation you mentioned in some categories, just any comments on the ability to pass that through and how that maybe compares to historical standards? I mean, are you finding it easier or the same in terms of passing along inflation at these high levels in some of the protein categories?\n\n---\n\nAs always, it's almost a category-by-category decision on where the inflation is and what the price points are doing to the customers. And if you pass it all on, what do you think the effect on units is going to be? And if you don't quite pass it all on, are you better off at the end of the day not passing all of it on? So it's a category-by-category decision. And I know Mike Donnelly and his team spent a lot of time trying to decide exactly what price points and how much of inflation to pass on and when to pass it on. I do want to reiterate that a couple of basis point decline in gross margin would have been a more normal decline in gross margin -- when I say normal, kind of the historical kind of numbers you would have seen in 2013 versus '14 if not having Harris Teeter in this year and not in the base. We continued to invest in the price -- actually, all 4 keys of the strategy this quarter. It's just that, with Harris Teeter being in there at a higher gross than we typically have run, it makes that decline look smaller.\n\n---\n\nThe other piece in terms looking at it on a -- from a historical standpoint, part of it is trying to decide how long is the inflation going to be in place. In some items, we would anticipate inflation is only going to be 4 to 8 to 12 weeks, depending on if it's weather-driven or if it's industry and other driven. That will also affect our ability and influence on how we try to pass that through as well.\n\n---\n\nIf -- you're mentioning sales were off to a strong start thus far in the quarter. Can you give us a little detail on that, including general merchandise sales and how you did thus far in the holiday selling area period?\n\n---\n\nYes. So far, if you look, it would be kind of -- fortunately, it's a similar comment that we made earlier or, I guess, really at last quarter. So far, we would be at the top end of the range. It's broad-based in all departments, so it's across the whole store. So we feel really good. The thing that makes it a little more complicated is we haven't cycled -- we're just now starting to cycle some of the weather from a year ago. So that's one of the reasons why we would get the wide range in kind of Mike's comments earlier.\n\n---\n\nYes, I understand, Rodney, on the weather comparisons. That's just going to be tough to predict and deal with. But just wanted to see what the actuals look like so far. And can you...\n\n---\n\nAnd then -- and jewelry, also, is good so far. And obviously, that's one of the most discretionary areas that we have.\n\n---\n\nI didn't know it was discretionary.\n\n---\n\nI have so many comments.\n\n---\n\nI -- also, could you repeat the private label percentages? I missed those earlier in the call.\n\n---\n\nYes, Mike?\n\n---\n\nWell, overall we were really pleased with the total private label sales. And our Kroger brand, which is our workhorse, showed really strong sales growth again. And in fact, all of the different banners -- brands, excuse me, really performed well, whether it's Simple Truth and Private Selection, all of those. But Corporate Brands in the third quarter represented 27.3% of total units and 25.8% of sales dollars. That's without fuel and pharmacy.\n\n---\n\nMy question is guidance related. I can understand why you might be slightly cautious in your outlook for next year if fuel margins revert to more normal levels. But your outlook for the fourth quarter, I think, is around 10% EPS growth if I use the midpoint of the range. So first, as a comment, I would have thought that the benefit from fuel could be potentially even higher in the fourth quarter based on the difference between the retail pump prices and wholesale prices and then looking at the year-over-year comparisons. So I was curious if you had any comment on that. And then, apart from fuel, are there any reasons why you're guiding to earnings growth lower in Q4 on a sequential basis?\n\n---\n\nIt would be primarily where fuel has been. Also, keep in mind our LIFO charge continues to go up throughout the year, and that's a bit of a headwind to earnings per share as well. And the single reason for the conversation about 2015 -- and again, I remind you we used the word if because it's difficult to project, it's really just the headwind that fuel potentially represents, 23 point -- a little over $0.23 margin on fuel. We've been in the fuel business a long time, and I personally don't remember a time where we've had anywhere near that kind of a number, and it's really difficult to predict where that may go. And again we're just -- we're trying to be transparent and let everybody know what we're thinking.\n\n---\n\nAnd what the key assumption is.\n\n---\n\nYes, what the key assumption is. Right.\n\n---\n\nAnd as a follow-up, I think in November, you cycled the SNAP reductions from last year. Is that a material benefit at all in terms of how you're looking at it? And then are you factoring in any recent changes in the competitive environment or shift in behavior by the consumer around the holidays into your fourth quarter outlook?\n\n---\n\nWhen you look at SNAP and then you look at that customer overall, their spending may have been down on SNAP specifically, but customers are using and have been using more of their own cash. So when you look at that like customer base, it actually increased. Hopefully, that customer's increased spending in cash is driven because their economic situation's better. That, we don't know. But that's been up all year. And we continue to see the household spending for a SNAP household increase. It's not increasing at the same rate as the overall company, but it is going up.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And finally, you may have mentioned this previously, but did you disclose the quarter-to-date comps, the actual figure?\n\n---\n\nNo, we did not.\n\n---\n\nJust said is...\n\n---\n\nAt the high end.\n\n---\n\nHigh end of our range for the quarter.\n\n---\n\nYou had mentioned that you were actually thinking about specific categories for further price investment. And I was wondering if you could elaborate on those and then the extent to which either the increase in protein prices or the decrease in gas prices are changing how you're thinking about where you're investing in price?\n\n---\n\nYes, we're very guarded about our plans of where we would invest in price because we don't want to announce to our competitors where we plan to become more competitive. So we hold that very close to our vest.\n\n---\n\nAre you seeing anything so far as the gas prices are dropping in terms of shifts in where consumers are being more or less price-sensitive?\n\n---\n\nNot in any big way.\n\n---\n\nI'll ask another natural foods question. I think you mentioned earlier on that you're seeing more conversions, people who weren't shopping, customers who weren't shopping the category coming into it. So  I want you to -- if you would, if you could, on some of your segmentation work, kind of elaborate on -- is that segment sort of driving the current growth you're seeing? And then contrast that to maybe folks who are already shopping the department and the penetration rates. And the third category, if you would address it, is there's been a prevailing theory for a long time, that consumer markets like Kroger would kind of see the natural food shopper and then, at some point, if they really converted to that lifestyle, would lose them to Whole Foods or an independent or somebody who could fulfill their whole basket. So I don't know if you're willing to talk about it, but are you trying to address that? I mean, are you seeing as they get to some point like hey, half their basket is this, and all of a sudden, they drop out? So if you would address that question, that'd be terrific to hear your response.\n\n---\n\nWell, there's about 4 questions in the question. But the last piece, the folks that we have converted, I think if we can continue to offer the products selection at the prices they're willing to pay, I think we can maintain them. I don't have data that really supports if they leave and go to competitors, but some of the things we're doing around the country with vitamin shops in our stores and really well-done, expanded natural food selection offering -- and we've worked really hard on price in the whole natural and organic area too. So we are the #2 retailer for natural and organic sales today. And we just kind of continue to push hard. We love that customer, and they're really a great customer for us.\n\n---\n\nAndy, you shouldn't expect us to willingly give up any customer. And when you look at the products that a lot of the natural food competitors offer, you can find the exact same item at Kroger and, as a general rule, at very good value. Do you want to add?\n\n---\n\nJust the last piece is, it's a large and growing segment of people who are trying to eat healthier, but they want to do so at a reasonable price. And I think, historically, it hasn't been that way. And today, you can shop for natural and organic and do it at a fairly reasonable price, and we're really trying to continue to make that offering, both selection and price.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Just to follow up because I know it was a long question, what about this trend you cited for -- is there an acceleration in new users, folks who are dabbling for the first time in...\n\n---\n\nDefinitely. There are people moving into the category, new customers entering natural, organic and healthy foods all the time. And again, a lot of it's because selection is better, I think, for us, and pricing is much stronger.\n\n---\n\nBut it's kind of interesting. Some of the -- a large part of our customers that switch over is because some items, they think, taste better. So it actually is driven by the taste. And in some situations, it's driven by the innovation of the product. So it's not just exclusively people wanting to live and just buy and eat natural products and organics. It's much broader than that. It's one of things that we get excited about having a store that has a lot of flexibility in it is that we can change what's inside the store based on what the customer's needs are and how those change. So we're excited about the category, and we're excited about the potential even more.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And just on the guidance very quick. It's probably been asked, but I'll ask it again if it has. If you take out the gas this year and Harris Teeter's accretion, or at least you gave a range, it looks like you're coming in around the high end of the 8% to 11% secular growth or maybe at the high end or a little better for the core business x those 2. And if you look at guiding to next year towards the lower end, is it more normalization of sales trends and maybe inflation? Or more, hey gas is -- you can't budget gas at the same level as this year as you're just sort of putting out this broad look to the lower end as sort of early guidance?\n\n---\n\nYes, as I said earlier, if you were to look at -- if you were to strip out the core grocery business, it would be higher in the range. But when you add the fuel in, that's -- if fuel margins revert to the mean, it would be the fuel that's driving it down.\n\n---\n\nThank you. Before we end today's call, I would like to say a few words about Dave Dillon, who is listening in this morning. All of you know Dave well, and this is his last official meeting as Kroger's Chairman. \r\nDave has been a friend and a leader to all of us and a mentor to many of us. Thousands of associates can relate to that comment. For me, personally, Dave has been a partner like no other. On behalf of the entire Kroger family, we wish Dave and his family all the best as they begin the next chapter together. Dave, thank you from all of us. \r\nFinally, I'd like to share some thoughts about our associates listening in. During the next few weeks, there will be a lot of activity in our stores as we help customers prepare for their holiday celebrations. Thank you for helping make the holidays brighter for our customers and the communities we serve and live in. \r\nDuring Kroger's season of giving, with your help and the help from our customers, we will donate 30 million meals to local food banks. Customers will have the opportunity to add their support by dropping change into coin boxes at check stands and donating nonperishable food in collection barrels in stores. Thank you for all that you do for our customers and each other. Merry Christmas. Happy holidays to you and your family. \r\nThat completes our call today. Thanks for joining.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Karen Short (Analysts)】\nJust a couple of questions regarding your guidance and, I guess, also this quarter. So obviously, gas margins more than offset the higher LIFO charge this quarter, and this year has been an incredible year from an earnings growth perspective. But I guess, what my question is, looking to next year, Mike, you talked about the lower end of the range of earnings growth. And I understand you're coming off of a very strong year. So my question for this current year is, was the strength more in overachieving on the Harris Teeter accretion side? Or was it broad-based across the core and Harris Teeter? And I guess that would lead me to, if it was broad-based across -- or if it was more Harris Teeter related, that explains why you might be at the lower end of the 8% to 11% next year. But if it was broad-based across Harris Teeter and the core, are you just being conservative for next year, even though this year was incredibly strong?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nWow. There was like 3 or 4 questions in there. Which way do I go with the answer? Well, fundamentally, this has been a very strong year across the board for us with the ID sales that we've had so far this year and ID -- positive ID sales in every department and positive ID sales in every geography. Our core business is performing extremely well. It's not just incremental accretion from Harris Teeter, it's strong results from all of our core operations. The primary reason for the conversation about being at the low end of 8% to 11% for next year is solely where fuel is at $0.23 for the quarter. And really, the last 2 quarters have been well above historical averages with the amount of fuel gallons we sell and that kind of outperformance on historical fuel margins. We just wanted people to be aware as they start thinking about 2015 of that potential headwind. If you were to kind of take the business apart and look at our core operations for 2015, they would perform extremely well inside the 8% to 11% range, and it's really just a headwind from a potential lower fuel margin per gallon for next year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Karen Short (Analysts)】\nAnd is it fair to say that Harris Teeter has come in slightly better than expected for the year so far?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nYes, I would characterize Harris Teeter as performing how we expected them to perform. We've -- as has been widely publicized, they've not been shy about advertising it. We've made the price investments in their business that we expected to make during the year. The customers are responding to those price investments, and I would characterize Harris Teeter as right on track with what our expectations would be relative to our overall guidance for the year.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nThe Harris Teeter team has done a nice job of running their own business, but the other thing is they've been incredibly helpful helping teach all of Kroger some ideas as well. So it's been great so far, and the synergy's moving along as we expected as well.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Karen Short (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then, just last question. On next year's earnings growth, what's embedded in terms of share buybacks?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nWe'll give full guidance in March. We just know that at this time of the year, with 3 quarters behind us, clearer fourth quarter guidance, since we only have one quarter left, people start to refine their 2015 estimates. And we just wanted to give some insight of our view of a percentage growth rate and where we would expect to fall in that range as you all start to prepare your estimates for 2015 or refine those estimates. But we'll wait until we give full guidance in March. We feel we've gone far enough with the EPS because our board has its annual business plan review meeting in January, and it's probably better served to let them approve our business plan for next year before I give you too many lines.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Steven Forbes (Analysts)】\nIt's actually Steve Forbes on for John today. Regarding gas, so we've historically found it difficult to find any real correlation between gas prices and comps. What are you seeing during the most recent period since these declines? I know you've recently touched on it before. But is there any particular region to call out? You mentioned the low -- lower-income consumer. Or is there any demographic that you can expand on as well?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nThe -- if you look at our own numbers, we would have difficulty finding some of the same correlations. When gas prices go up, our fuel reward program has a little bit more strength. As gas prices go down, people have more money to spend. So as you know, when we look at fuel, we just look at one more service that we're offering the customer and one more reason to come to Kroger. The comments that we made -- that Mike and I both made, we continue to see improvement in the economy. It's slow, but it's going in the right direction, and it's really across all customers. But if you look at mainstream and up, those customers have fully recovered. The customers that are on a budget are improving, but it's much slower and more constrained.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Steven Forbes (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then just on the deployment of these windfalls, is there -- I'm sure there's thoughts around how to invest these benefits. But do they occur too quickly in order to appropriately plan for the deployment? Or is it just better to let it flow through to the bottom line? How do you guys think about these onetime or short-term benefits?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nWell, if you look at like the tax settlements and stuff, we just let those, for the most part, be when they are. And we just disclose it to let you know what it is. And it flows to the bottom line, but it's onetime. If it's things that we think are things that are sustainable, those are the things that we would look at in terms of continuing to invest in the business from a service standpoint and a price standpoint. But it's -- as you mentioned, it's always a balance between those 2 pieces, and we are always focused on what's going on in the marketplace and what do we think is the best use of that opportunity when it happens. So it doesn't answer your question directly because the answer's actually different depending on what we see the opportunities to be.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Judah Frommer (Analysts)】\nJudah on for Ed. You mentioned in the release and also on the call the kind of rolling 4-quarter x fuel operating margin being a little bit stronger than you expected it to be. I mean, is that a way of saying you would have liked to maybe invest more in price? Or how should we kind of translate that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nI don't think it's a reflection of having -- wanting to invest more in price. It's really a reflection of having Harris Teeter in for a portion of the year and not all year compared to results last year that didn't have Harris Teeter in the numbers. And I would say that's the same thing for the -- just a couple of basis points decline in the gross margin number I talked about. If you were to strip Harris Teeter out of the prior year, you would have seen a much bigger amount that we have invested in, in price to continue to give value to our customers, but it's really that -- the fact that their historical numbers have been higher than ours, and it's the mention of those together that's driving some unusual comparisons. We've continued right on track with what our expectations were for investment in all 4 keys of our Customer 1st Strategy, not just price, but the people, the products and the shopping experience as well, and continue to be very pleased with the reaction our customers have with those investments.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Judah Frommer (Analysts)】\nOkay. And if I could just sneak one more in there, maybe shifting gears. On natural organic, it sounds like it's still comping really well. You've mentioned, in the past, maybe eventually seeing some margin compression in the category. And now that you have one of the bigger players in this space with a national ad campaign out there highlighting value, have you seen anything in kind of the near term on margins there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ellis (Executives)】\nI haven't really seen margin pressure overall. We continue to invest in price where we feel appropriate, and the customer really drives our pricing strategy for the most part. But again, we had strong sales growth and double-digit growth in national organics. And to go back to our Simple Truth brand, which will hit $1 billion this year, we're really proud of where that's going and what it's contributing.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Vincent Sinisi (Analysts)】\nI also wanted to ask a bit more on the natural organic. Obviously, Simple Truth continues to perform very well. But can you also give us a little color on how some of the other categories and products within natural organic are doing? And maybe touch upon, also, some of the Vitacost products?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ellis (Executives)】\nWell, in natural foods, the expansion of item selection is continuing to grow. And you're finding more and more products in the dairy category. We just introduced a new line, the Simple Truth lunchmeats. So there's a lot of activity. And we're still finding so many of our customers that didn't shop natural foods are beginning to migrate over to that business, which has been really, really good for us. On the Vitacost piece, we're still in a honeymoon. It's only been a couple of month since we merged with Vitacost, and there's a lot of work going on, but we have big plans for Vitacost, and we're excited about the merger. I've been to the facilities, down to their offices, to their warehouses, and it's a great business that we have. And we're excited about where we're going to go into next year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Vincent Sinisi (Analysts)】\nOkay. Great. And just a follow-up, if I may. Regarding your relationship, the dunnhumby relationship, as you continue to have nice growth in your loyal households and loyal customers, I know that part of what you're looking at is also not only continuing to have your current loyal customers purchase more, but also convert others into being loyal customers. Can you talk about any -- if there are any either new strategies or learnings that you're finding as you're going through?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nIf you look at all of our data insights, and dunnhumby that you referenced is obviously one piece of that, but there's a lot of other insights, you're continually getting insights and testing things. And the things that work, you do more of, and the ones that don't work, you stop doing. And that never stops. So it's an ongoing basis in terms of trying to understand customer needs. So if you think about your earlier question on natural and organics, well, that's some insights from our customers. But one of the things our customers are very clear is they don't want to have to pay a premium for natural and organics, and we're trying to make sure that we have where they can get a good-quality product at a price that's comparable to the nonorganic brands and, in some cases, actually the same price. So it's, really, that would just be one example, but there's a whole host of things where you're continually trying to get insights, insights on actually where to locate stores. It's broad parts of our business, and it's actually getting that insight and using it is the key.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rupesh Parikh (Analysts)】\nSo I just wanted to just touch on inflation. Clearly, you had a nice benefit in inflation this quarter. I just want to see if you guys can share, maybe, your early thoughts for inflation for the upcoming year.\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nAs we sit here today, we would actually expect -- I'm always hesitant to go here because I've proven my inability to predict this with the fluctuations we have on our LIFO charge, which is tied to inflation, but we would expect inflation next year to be a little bit more moderate than it is this year. Clearly, the protein categories don't really show any signs of letting up on inflation. Chicken may happen if corn prices stay down at some point, but beef and pork, we would expect to see probably close to double-digit inflation again next year. Milk, at this point, again, as you know, the milk prices are driven by federal market order. As we sit here today, it looks like they may come in some, which would help a lot of categories next year. But overall, just given where some of the core input categories are, it looks like we should be a little bit lower than the 3.5% that's out there. That said, embedded in that 3.5% is pharmaceuticals, which continue to have -- particularly in the generic category, which has not always been the case, which continue to have quite high inflation in them.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nOne of the things that we think is important, when you look at inflation over the last 10 years, Kroger's been able to really manage in all inflationary environments, whether there's been deflation or inflation. There's always a transition if it suddenly changes quickly, very high or very low, to manage that transition. But over time, we've found that we really -- our associates have the ability to manage in all environments.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rupesh Parikh (Analysts)】\nOkay. That's helpful. And then maybe just shifting gear to your ID sales. Do you feel -- as you look at your IDs this quarter, do you feel that you're maybe winning new customers maybe at an accelerated pace from earlier this year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nThe thing that's exciting, and Mike mentioned it in his prepared comments, we're seeing good growth with our existing customers, but we're also seeing new loyal shoppers. And so it's really balanced across both, and that's one of the things exciting. And it's been -- it's a little bit higher now than earlier in the year, but it was strong earlier in the year, as well. I don't know, Mike, if you want to add anything.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ellis (Executives)】\nNo. I think you hit it. It's just -- it's been solid, yes. Thanks, Rodney.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Mushkin (Analysts)】\nMine's actually much more of a kind of strategic, long-term question and just trying to understand kind of the growth trajectory of the company. You guys were nice enough to take us to a Marketplace store, I think, that was converted from a regular grocery store. And it seems like that conversion has gone quite well. So I guess I'm just trying to understand. It seems, as we think about Kroger, that in a lot of ways, you have a better mousetrap at this stage, and that Marketplace store is certainly one of the key elements. You guys went through -- and this goes way back in the, I think, late '60s, early '70s, into a big kind of store upgrade cycle, and you became a good to great stock in Jim Collins' work. I mean, how close are we to really getting into a big upgrade cycle on your store fleet where you really deploy Marketplace in a much more aggressive way? So that's my first question about long-term growth.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nWell, as you know, when you were out in October, we're obviously very excited about the Marketplace stores and the use of all our formats together. It's one of the reasons why, a couple of years ago, we committed and -- to increase our capital investment by $200 million a year, and we continue to do that. We think that's a good amount to accelerate capital by in terms of the ability to operate the store at the level that you saw and balance in terms of the use of the cash flow. As long as -- as we continue to get the performance from those stores as we expect, you'll see it to continue accelerating that capital investment. But that was the reason why, in October of '12, we outlined the need to increase capital by $200 million a year. I don't know, Mike, if you want to...\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nNo, I would agree with that, and it's -- we -- as you know, Scott, we continue to expect increased capital over the next several years by incremental amounts. I -- if there's one disappointment I have so far this year, it's that -- actually, that we're at the low end of our CapEx guidance. I know some people out there think we spend too much on CapEx, but that just means some stores aren't coming out of the ground as quickly as we had hoped. It doesn't mean that we're less bullish on the new stores we're opening. It's just a matter of timing of those projects, and they will get caught up. So we're very bullish on our ability to continue to open new stores and have them perform very well.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ellis (Executives)】\nOne other comment. We have Marketplace stores now in just about every division of our company across the country, and the success we're having with the Marketplace store has been really pleasing. But you asked about remerchandising, and I know you saw apparel in some of our stores now. We're having some success in -- with some of these new brands, some of the new products we're putting in. So we continue to work on the model to make it relevant to the customer, but we're really pleased with what we have today.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Mushkin (Analysts)】\nAnd as a follow-up -- I mean, any thought process as to how many stores in the store fleet could eventually be Marketplace?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nWe probably do, but probably not for public consumption at this point, Scott. The other thing to keep in mind is, as we go down this path, and you'll probably see it a little clearer as we get into next year, we continue to invest in our business. And a fundamental piece of being able to invest in our business is continuing to generate a really good return on our new investments. And some of those dollars, we make conscious decisions of how many fall to the bottom line and how many we invest back into the business and the people, product, shopping experience and price. And while I know a lot of you would think that we should be at the end of investing in price, we still see plenty of categories and particular sections of the store where we have an opportunity to be more price competitive than we are today. So we're, in some respects, counting on that continued good results from that deployment of capital to both increase to have the 8% to 11% earnings per share growth and have the dollars generated to invest back in our business.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Mushkin (Analysts)】\nAnd then I just had one more, and then I'll yield. And it goes to the long-term growth again. M&A, we talked about it at the Analyst Day. It seems, again, Kroger, better mousetrap, fuel program, dunnhumby, customer insights, Marketplace store. It seems, as you guys evaluate -- at least from my perspective, evaluate M&A activity, there's almost a checklist of what you might want out of a company that you were going to acquire. But it does seem like it's a little bit different now, given the success you have with your business. Any thoughts, any additional thoughts? Again, I know asked this at the Analyst Day, but I wanted to revisit it.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nYes, I wouldn't say that there's anything much different than what we answered. As we talked about then, one of the keys on any merger, how's the -- how are the people that run the business? And do we think, culturally, they have the same values we have? And that's one of the reasons why we always talk about mergers rather than acquisition. You get a more limited number of opportunities when you have that standard, but what we find is, when people have that standard, they like it going the other direction, as well. And we always like to point out the fact that 2 of our last 3 CEOs came out of one of our merged companies and several of our senior officers.\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nAnd our current President...\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nYes, came out of one of the merged companies. So I think you're right when you say it's almost a checklist because it is, but it's something that's really worked well for us.\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nAnd Scott, something I would add to that. And I certainly understand your question and the seeming benefits we could bring to some M&A activity that may be not as strong as we may hope or not have everything on our checklist. When you sit back and you have opportunity x and you look around the organization as a company in our geographies where we are today, and you can clearly see where you can double market share in specific geographies by deploying new capital in those geographies. And you have a base of people and a recognition in that market and already strong customer acceptance. We typically default to that fill-in strategy that we talked about because it's a much surer thing, takes a lot less time and energy of the organization, has significantly less management distraction. And we're perfectly willing to sit and almost wait, not necessarily troll around the country for those opportunities to come long like the Harris Teeter did.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nThe other thing that would be needed for us to change our approach is if we find that we're able to develop talent faster than we can use it within our existing growth where -- because if we bought something that was something that needed to be fixed up, we would obviously need to figure out a way to put talent into it in a way that was effective. And that would require a different level of talent than we're producing today because we're really focused on developing the talent to support the growth we have.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Wiltamuth (Analysts)】\nCould you give us a little perspective on just how much the gas gain was in EPS terms? And what quarter should we really think about the headwinds starting to arrive as you lap the stronger margins from last year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nYes. We -- Mark, we won't go into the benefit of the EPS benefit. But if you think about a $0.23 fuel margin and $0.17 last year, you get a feel -- we talked about, in a lot of places, the number of gallons that we pump. So you should be able to back into a number that gets you relatively close. We just don't want to -- we think about that department as any other department inside the company, and it happens to be performing very well right now. I would say, clearly, the second and third quarter of next year, if margins revert to a more historical kind of level, would start to experience some headwind from lower fuel margins. Again, we didn't say \"when\" in the comments purposefully. We said \"if\" because nobody can really predict where it is. And we typically turn fuel a lot faster than our competitors. So in down cycles, that's good. In up cycles, that's bad. So if fuel were to turn the other way and -- or oil was to turn the other way and start going up, that actually creates an incremental headwind, not just a normal headwind, because we're turning the fuel so quickly. But clearly, second and third quarter.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nAnd one of the things, as Mike mentioned earlier, we have a January meeting with our board for them to actually approve our '15 plan. Normally, we would not share '15 details until the fourth quarter earnings release, but we just thought it would be helpful to give a little bit of color on what we're thinking and what we're seeing before then for next year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Wiltamuth (Analysts)】\nThat's fair. And then, on the inflation in those meat categories where you're still seeing that double-digit inflation, are you passing all that through? Because we are hearing some other retailers are having some difficulty passing it through.\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nWell, inflation for us -- inflation and deflation come and go all the time, and we're constantly dealing with pricing and how do we continue to give value to the customer through inflation and deflation, whether it's meat, produce or any other part of our business. So we try to manage it in a way that still gives great value to the customer, and the customer decides what they're going to pay. But I can tell you our tonnage is good, and inflation is extremely high right now. And we're just trying to really manage our way through it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Stephen Grambling (Analysts)】\nAs you think about just the broader industry, I was hoping you could just talk maybe about where you think some of the gains that you're getting are coming from, how you see that evolving. I think it was at an Analyst Day a few years back where you discussed some of the regional players ceding share pretty consistently. Are you seeing that accelerate? Or is there anything else that you can just talk to broadly?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nIt's -- as you know, we don't ever talk about specific competitors. In terms of where the market share is coming from, it's always easier to ask the question than it is to see. It looks pretty broad-based in terms of where it's coming from, but we see, at some other national players, they are gaining share as well. So we're not the only one. But there's still about half of the market that's out there that's not people with our economies of scale, and it's not necessarily just small regional people. Some of them could be a little bit bigger. And then the other piece is we continue to add categories that we didn't even have before, which is helping some of our growth.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Stephen Grambling (Analysts)】\nThat's helpful. And then, are you seeing any difference in terms of the comp performance by the format of your stores? And do you feel like, after so many years of positive ID growth or productivity growth, that you're hitting a ceiling in any of these?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nIt's a good question. It's -- if you look at the comps, you always have pockets that are better than others, but it's very broad-based. And when you look at age and other things, obviously, newer stores will have a higher comp than older stores. But outside of that, there's nothing that would cause us to say one thing or the other. And probably -- I'm sure we have some stores that are getting close to capacity, but as a general rule, we have plenty of capacity within our existing stores to continue to increase the business.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kelly Bania (Analysts)】\nJust wanted to ask about the guidance for the fourth quarter for IDs. You mentioned the difficulty in forecasting when you cycle that benefit from the winter weather last year. I'm just curious if you are able to or have been able to at all look at your data and use dunnhumby and see how much of that boost that you may have had last year was from existing or loyal customers versus new customers and if there's any strategies in place to help kind of cycle that benefit that you may have had last winter.\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nWell, clearly, we can understand where that business is coming from, and in those -- in regions where the snow or the weather is going to be -- get volatile in a big way, you get a lot of people from all spectrums of the loyalty umbrella, if you will, from people who rarely shop with you, but they come to you because you might be the one that is on stock on product, to your most loyal customers who come in and stock up. Obviously, we aren't -- for the fourth quarter, Mike Donnelly and Robert Clark and their merchandising group isn't sitting back just hoping for weather for us to be able to cycle the great sales we had last year's fourth quarter. They know what days and what weeks there was weather, and they would have strategies in place to try to cover some of the uplift we had in the -- from that snow. But the amount of incremental volume you get in a 36-hour period from snow is phenomenal, and it would be a Herculean effort on their part to be able to come up with strategies to overcome all of it. Clearly, we're going to go do our best to overcome it the best we can. We'll have weather. We don't know when. We don't know where. We don't know what day. We don't know...\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nOr how much.\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nWe don't know if it'll be by the end of January. We don't know if it'll be in February, March at the beginning of the next year. But it happens every year. You just don't know when.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nYes, the other thing is, when you look at the weather, I have a couple of friends that own quite a few fast food restaurants. And they will -- they always tell me that they hate snow because it actually has the opposite effect on them. So it's actually some of our increase is getting business that customers would sometimes be going to other channels. And obviously, when kids stay home, they're eating at home versus eating at school. So some of it is just switching where somebody eats.\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nRight.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kelly Bania (Analysts)】\nGot it. That's helpful. And then just another question on gross margin. Your FIFO gross margin x fuel only down 2 basis points in spite of some of the high inflation you mentioned in some categories, just any comments on the ability to pass that through and how that maybe compares to historical standards? I mean, are you finding it easier or the same in terms of passing along inflation at these high levels in some of the protein categories?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nAs always, it's almost a category-by-category decision on where the inflation is and what the price points are doing to the customers. And if you pass it all on, what do you think the effect on units is going to be? And if you don't quite pass it all on, are you better off at the end of the day not passing all of it on? So it's a category-by-category decision. And I know Mike Donnelly and his team spent a lot of time trying to decide exactly what price points and how much of inflation to pass on and when to pass it on. I do want to reiterate that a couple of basis point decline in gross margin would have been a more normal decline in gross margin -- when I say normal, kind of the historical kind of numbers you would have seen in 2013 versus '14 if not having Harris Teeter in this year and not in the base. We continued to invest in the price -- actually, all 4 keys of the strategy this quarter. It's just that, with Harris Teeter being in there at a higher gross than we typically have run, it makes that decline look smaller.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nThe other piece in terms looking at it on a -- from a historical standpoint, part of it is trying to decide how long is the inflation going to be in place. In some items, we would anticipate inflation is only going to be 4 to 8 to 12 weeks, depending on if it's weather-driven or if it's industry and other driven. That will also affect our ability and influence on how we try to pass that through as well.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Cerankosky (Analysts)】\nIf -- you're mentioning sales were off to a strong start thus far in the quarter. Can you give us a little detail on that, including general merchandise sales and how you did thus far in the holiday selling area period?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nYes. So far, if you look, it would be kind of -- fortunately, it's a similar comment that we made earlier or, I guess, really at last quarter. So far, we would be at the top end of the range. It's broad-based in all departments, so it's across the whole store. So we feel really good. The thing that makes it a little more complicated is we haven't cycled -- we're just now starting to cycle some of the weather from a year ago. So that's one of the reasons why we would get the wide range in kind of Mike's comments earlier.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Cerankosky (Analysts)】\nYes, I understand, Rodney, on the weather comparisons. That's just going to be tough to predict and deal with. But just wanted to see what the actuals look like so far. And can you...\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nAnd then -- and jewelry, also, is good so far. And obviously, that's one of the most discretionary areas that we have.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Cerankosky (Analysts)】\nI didn't know it was discretionary.\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nI have so many comments.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Cerankosky (Analysts)】\nI -- also, could you repeat the private label percentages? I missed those earlier in the call.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nYes, Mike?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ellis (Executives)】\nWell, overall we were really pleased with the total private label sales. And our Kroger brand, which is our workhorse, showed really strong sales growth again. And in fact, all of the different banners -- brands, excuse me, really performed well, whether it's Simple Truth and Private Selection, all of those. But Corporate Brands in the third quarter represented 27.3% of total units and 25.8% of sales dollars. That's without fuel and pharmacy.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ajay Jain (Analysts)】\nMy question is guidance related. I can understand why you might be slightly cautious in your outlook for next year if fuel margins revert to more normal levels. But your outlook for the fourth quarter, I think, is around 10% EPS growth if I use the midpoint of the range. So first, as a comment, I would have thought that the benefit from fuel could be potentially even higher in the fourth quarter based on the difference between the retail pump prices and wholesale prices and then looking at the year-over-year comparisons. So I was curious if you had any comment on that. And then, apart from fuel, are there any reasons why you're guiding to earnings growth lower in Q4 on a sequential basis?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nIt would be primarily where fuel has been. Also, keep in mind our LIFO charge continues to go up throughout the year, and that's a bit of a headwind to earnings per share as well. And the single reason for the conversation about 2015 -- and again, I remind you we used the word if because it's difficult to project, it's really just the headwind that fuel potentially represents, 23 point -- a little over $0.23 margin on fuel. We've been in the fuel business a long time, and I personally don't remember a time where we've had anywhere near that kind of a number, and it's really difficult to predict where that may go. And again we're just -- we're trying to be transparent and let everybody know what we're thinking.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nAnd what the key assumption is.\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nYes, what the key assumption is. Right.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ajay Jain (Analysts)】\nAnd as a follow-up, I think in November, you cycled the SNAP reductions from last year. Is that a material benefit at all in terms of how you're looking at it? And then are you factoring in any recent changes in the competitive environment or shift in behavior by the consumer around the holidays into your fourth quarter outlook?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nWhen you look at SNAP and then you look at that customer overall, their spending may have been down on SNAP specifically, but customers are using and have been using more of their own cash. So when you look at that like customer base, it actually increased. Hopefully, that customer's increased spending in cash is driven because their economic situation's better. That, we don't know. But that's been up all year. And we continue to see the household spending for a SNAP household increase. It's not increasing at the same rate as the overall company, but it is going up.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ajay Jain (Analysts)】\nOkay. And finally, you may have mentioned this previously, but did you disclose the quarter-to-date comps, the actual figure?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nNo, we did not.\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nJust said is...\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nAt the high end.\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nHigh end of our range for the quarter.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Stacie  Rabinowitz (Analysts)】\nYou had mentioned that you were actually thinking about specific categories for further price investment. And I was wondering if you could elaborate on those and then the extent to which either the increase in protein prices or the decrease in gas prices are changing how you're thinking about where you're investing in price?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nYes, we're very guarded about our plans of where we would invest in price because we don't want to announce to our competitors where we plan to become more competitive. So we hold that very close to our vest.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Stacie  Rabinowitz (Analysts)】\nAre you seeing anything so far as the gas prices are dropping in terms of shifts in where consumers are being more or less price-sensitive?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nNot in any big way.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Wolf (Analysts)】\nI'll ask another natural foods question. I think you mentioned earlier on that you're seeing more conversions, people who weren't shopping, customers who weren't shopping the category coming into it. So  I want you to -- if you would, if you could, on some of your segmentation work, kind of elaborate on -- is that segment sort of driving the current growth you're seeing? And then contrast that to maybe folks who are already shopping the department and the penetration rates. And the third category, if you would address it, is there's been a prevailing theory for a long time, that consumer markets like Kroger would kind of see the natural food shopper and then, at some point, if they really converted to that lifestyle, would lose them to Whole Foods or an independent or somebody who could fulfill their whole basket. So I don't know if you're willing to talk about it, but are you trying to address that? I mean, are you seeing as they get to some point like hey, half their basket is this, and all of a sudden, they drop out? So if you would address that question, that'd be terrific to hear your response.\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nWell, there's about 4 questions in the question. But the last piece, the folks that we have converted, I think if we can continue to offer the products selection at the prices they're willing to pay, I think we can maintain them. I don't have data that really supports if they leave and go to competitors, but some of the things we're doing around the country with vitamin shops in our stores and really well-done, expanded natural food selection offering -- and we've worked really hard on price in the whole natural and organic area too. So we are the #2 retailer for natural and organic sales today. And we just kind of continue to push hard. We love that customer, and they're really a great customer for us.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nAndy, you shouldn't expect us to willingly give up any customer. And when you look at the products that a lot of the natural food competitors offer, you can find the exact same item at Kroger and, as a general rule, at very good value. Do you want to add?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nJust the last piece is, it's a large and growing segment of people who are trying to eat healthier, but they want to do so at a reasonable price. And I think, historically, it hasn't been that way. And today, you can shop for natural and organic and do it at a fairly reasonable price, and we're really trying to continue to make that offering, both selection and price.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Wolf (Analysts)】\nOkay. Just to follow up because I know it was a long question, what about this trend you cited for -- is there an acceleration in new users, folks who are dabbling for the first time in...\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nDefinitely. There are people moving into the category, new customers entering natural, organic and healthy foods all the time. And again, a lot of it's because selection is better, I think, for us, and pricing is much stronger.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nBut it's kind of interesting. Some of the -- a large part of our customers that switch over is because some items, they think, taste better. So it actually is driven by the taste. And in some situations, it's driven by the innovation of the product. So it's not just exclusively people wanting to live and just buy and eat natural products and organics. It's much broader than that. It's one of things that we get excited about having a store that has a lot of flexibility in it is that we can change what's inside the store based on what the customer's needs are and how those change. So we're excited about the category, and we're excited about the potential even more.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Wolf (Analysts)】\nOkay. And just on the guidance very quick. It's probably been asked, but I'll ask it again if it has. If you take out the gas this year and Harris Teeter's accretion, or at least you gave a range, it looks like you're coming in around the high end of the 8% to 11% secular growth or maybe at the high end or a little better for the core business x those 2. And if you look at guiding to next year towards the lower end, is it more normalization of sales trends and maybe inflation? Or more, hey gas is -- you can't budget gas at the same level as this year as you're just sort of putting out this broad look to the lower end as sort of early guidance?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nYes, as I said earlier, if you were to look at -- if you were to strip out the core grocery business, it would be higher in the range. But when you add the fuel in, that's -- if fuel margins revert to the mean, it would be the fuel that's driving it down.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nThank you. Before we end today's call, I would like to say a few words about Dave Dillon, who is listening in this morning. All of you know Dave well, and this is his last official meeting as Kroger's Chairman. \r\nDave has been a friend and a leader to all of us and a mentor to many of us. Thousands of associates can relate to that comment. For me, personally, Dave has been a partner like no other. On behalf of the entire Kroger family, we wish Dave and his family all the best as they begin the next chapter together. Dave, thank you from all of us. \r\nFinally, I'd like to share some thoughts about our associates listening in. During the next few weeks, there will be a lot of activity in our stores as we help customers prepare for their holiday celebrations. Thank you for helping make the holidays brighter for our customers and the communities we serve and live in. \r\nDuring Kroger's season of giving, with your help and the help from our customers, we will donate 30 million meals to local food banks. Customers will have the opportunity to add their support by dropping change into coin boxes at check stands and donating nonperishable food in collection barrels in stores. Thank you for all that you do for our customers and each other. Merry Christmas. Happy holidays to you and your family. \r\nThat completes our call today. Thanks for joining.",

      "transcript_text1": "Good morning, everyone. I'm Matt Ginter, Vice President of Investor Relations for 3M Company. Welcome to our 2015 Outlook Meeting. I'd like to also welcome all investors and analysts that are listening via webcast today.\r\nWe've got a good lineup of speakers today. Of course, you'll hear from our Chairman, President and CEO, Inge Thulin; and from our CFO and Senior Vice President, Nick Gangestad. Also presenting today are Frank Little, and Frank heads up our Safety and Graphics business; Mike Roman who runs our Industrial business; and H.C. Shin who leads 3M's international operations. These are 3 very large parts of our business, representing the majority of our sales, and I think you'll walk away with a better understanding of them.\r\nI'd like to mention just a few upcoming events. First, our 2015 earnings calls will be on January 27, April 23, July 23 and October 22. And second, please mark your calendars for next December 15 when we plan to host our 2016 Outlook Meeting. For now, plan on 8:00 to noon that day, and we'll communicate more details as they develop.\r\nPlease take a moment to read the forward-looking statement. During today's conference call, we'll make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.\r\nSo very quickly, here's today's agenda. Inge will open up, followed by Nick, by Frank, Mike -- or excuse me, by Frank, Mike and H.C., and then Nick will finish the day. We'll have Q&A at the end with all speakers on stage. And the meeting will adjourn no later than 11:00 a.m. So once again, thanks for participating. And I would like to introduce 3M's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Inge Thulin.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Matt, and good morning to all of you. It's a pleasure to have you here at 3M's 2015 Outlook Meeting in New York. And it's a pleasure for me to be here today with Frank, with Nick, H.C., Mike and Matt Ginter in order to explain our business.\r\nSo what I would like to start with is, first of all, to lay out the agenda for my portion here. I will start by giving you the headlines of the day. I will again talk about our playbook that is in place and now working and operationalizing, talk about our '13 to '17 5-year plan update, and then talk about the 3 key levers that is driving and extending the value of the corporation, and you will hear from each presenter today how we are utilizing them in the corporation.\r\nSo first of all, relative to the headlines of the day. We are on track to deliver our 2013 to '17 financial objectives, as laid out in our Investor Meeting in St. Paul, November 8, 2012. We are creating additional and substantial shareholder value through the 3 key levers: Portfolio management, investing in innovation and business transformation, and we will talk about all of them today. We are delivering strong organic sales growth, and you will see in some information from Nick in the end of the evidence around that versus when we started the journey. Our productivity is improving margins, not only in 2014, but also some margin expansion in 2015.\r\nAnd this morning, we announced an increase for 2015 in the per share dividend by 20%, which is coming on top of a 35% increase in 2014. And then we are executing on the capital structure strategy that we announced last year. So no change yet from that perspective, and I'm here to tell you that the plan is working and we feel very good, and I have very high confidence in the execution of the plan.\r\nSo let me start by just to give a couple of comments relative to the way we execute the playbook in order to create more value for shareholders. We laid out a very clear vision in the beginning of 2012. We complement that with the 6 strategies. We also took a hard look at the business conduct and simplified that as that is, in fact, priority #1 for us, to protect the corporation in everything we do. And then we have also laid out some new 3M leadership behaviors, which is important for the leaders in the company in order to execute the plan. That's augmented by portfolio management, invest in innovation and business transformation, that is then the key driver and lever for us as we move ahead. So very important thing when we look upon it.\r\nThe important thing where we crystallized the vision was to make sure that everyone, both internally and externally, knew and understood the purpose about 3M. And when you look upon it, it's very holistic and it's a vision that is right down to the heart of 3M. We talk about advancing, enhancing and improving, and that is what we do at 3M everyday. Everyday, we wake up today and what we have done for the last 112 years is to ask ourself, how can we advance and enhance and improve.\r\nWhen you think about our portfolio from a product perspective and you think about the geographical area, that's a vision as a stretch. We can do that for every company, every home and for every life around the world. And it's very clear for most of us what company and home stand for. For life, for us, is both schools, hospitals and it's also sustainability and community. And the way we do it, which is coming back to what 3M is all about relative to the research and development be the heartbeat of the company, is through technologies, products and innovation. So this was an important statement and that, by definition, is what is driving the company and the decision we are making relative to the long-term vision.\r\nWe complemented that with 6 strategies, which has sort of enabled those for us in order to obtain the vision at the point. They are interdependent. They're very well-crafted relative to the wording, so everyone knows what needs to be done. And they are, today, after almost 3 years in the company, totally operationalized into the operation.  The 4 first of them are around growth, the fifth one is around our people and the last one is around operational excellence.\r\nThe first one start with a very important statement that was laid out at the time, which is relevance to our customers, and I will show in a second what we have done in order to improve the relevance to our customers. So it was not only wording in the strategy, we are also taking action. We were very clear on that.\r\nThe third strategy is the only strategy that start with a statement: Invest in innovation. And as you know, we have ramped up from closer to -- we have been around 5.5% in the past, currently coming closer to 6% in the 5-year plan. So this was an important starting point for us as we start to roll out the plan.\r\nAnd on November 8, 2012, we also declared for you our objectives in terms of our 5-year plan as we go forward, which was earnings per growth of 9% to 11%, organic revenue growth of 4% to 6%, return on invested capital around 20% and free cash flow conversion around 100%. And as I started the meeting, I'm pleased to tell you we're on the road in order to meet those objectives as we go ahead.\r\nNow this is how we organize. And here, you can see a couple of elements on this slide. First of all, you can see that we have very solid performance across all of our business groups. And the 2 figures you will see is the -- the growth figure is the plan we laid out from '13 to '17, and operating income figure you see is year-to-date Q3. So you can see the plan for the company over the 5 years is 4% to 6%, with slight difference in between the 5 businesses, but you can also see the operating income for every single business is above 20%. In fact, we have one which is Health Care, even above 30%. So average of the company of the 3 quarters this year is 23%, with all businesses above 20%. So a very solid, good performance in all business groups.\r\nNow this is an important element because the question is, of course, how is that possible to have these premium margins year-after-year, and in fact, also show some margin expansion. Well, here is the 4 fundamental strengths of 3M. And it's an important slide because this is illustrating our vertical and horizontal business model, and that is what is driving the value of the company. So they are around technology, manufacturing, global capabilities and brands.\r\nSo let me make some comments on technology. So this is the ability for us to share and combine elements in the technology platforms that produce unique, differentiated products that is translating to premium margins. Very important, and I will talk more about that when I talk about technologies later on.\r\nIf you look upon manufacturing, that is where we can use technologies to include processes, that's our trade secrets, that will take us to production capabilities that will produce superior products to a very low cost, again, able to utilize capacity and capabilities all over the world. Everyone in the company can use it in terms of the assets that are there.\r\nGlobal capabilities, this is our subsidiary structure all over the world. And as you saw earlier this year that we also purchased the last 25% of our Japanese operation of Sumitomo. This is where we can commercialize and adapt commercialization on a local base. And in every case, we are the first entry into a market. We don't enter into a distributor. We enter into the 3M subsidiary, meaning, we decide the priorities in that country.\r\nAnd then finally, our brand equity, which is a strategic brand, but also then complemented with many power brands in the organization. But by definition, the brand is what you're standing up for 3M, enabled for every business to utilize.\r\nSo those are the fundamental strengths and the foundation for the performance relative to what we have done for many, many years and will continue to do. And you will hear more about it, how that is impacting the different business groups that are presenting this morning.\r\nNow we have talked earlier, and I would like to just lay it out again that one of the strengths with 3M, as we are so global our nature, is the way we can capitalize on the evolution of an economy. And we all know that the evolution of an economy is basically, the first step is infrastructure. When infrastructure is in place, manufacturing are moving in, in a much bigger scale in terms of -- \r\n[Audio Gap] \r\nmanufacturing up and going, work is created in the countries, people start to spend money, and that is when retail start to accelerate.\r\nAnd the final step is around health care for a country. So of course, there's been health care provided before, but is moving to a new level as you're coming to that step in the evolution. This is for every country around the world. It was in the United States when this was developed. It was in Sweden when that was developed. And it's in many of the developing economies today.\r\nFor us, when you look upon our portfolio, we are evaluating opportunities in every stage of that evolution of a country. So if it's early on, we are either in with traffic safety system or our communication business. When you go to manufacturing, that is where we have 1/3 of our revenue in the company, big business that Mike Roman will talk about later today. Safety is coming very much into regulation and fall protection, et cetera. And of course, into retail, that is where we start to capitalize on our consumer group, with all the brands in terms of Post-it, Scotch, Filtrete, Command, et cetera. And then finally, health care, that is coming in the end with more sophisticated solution. This is a proven model for success for 3M. We have done it for many years. And also, if you go back to the other slide and look upon the margin differentiation in between the businesses, this is a model that is working very well for us not only in terms of growth, but also in terms of maintaining and improving margin as we move ahead.\r\nAnd when we go back to the evolution of the mix for us in between developed and developing economies, back in 2003, you can see here that developing stand -- stood for 21% of our mix; and developed, 79%. We stand today at 35%-65%. And moving forward, it look like it will be in the range of 60%-40%, with a growth rate in the developed world of 2% to 4% and probably 7% to 10% in the developing world. So still a good evolution. And for us, even if landscape from time to time, as we know, change in between developed and developing economy, the important thing is to stick to your long-term plan, but adjust for short-term interruptions in the economy.\r\nSo let me then talk about the 3 key levers because they are important for us in order to create even more value as we move ahead. And we have done quite a bit the last almost 3 years now, and I would like to give you an update on what we did and where we're going for the future.\r\nSo this is, first of all, relative to portfolio. This is not a program. This is, as all of you know, this a process that you constantly work on, and it's important for us to continue to deploy opportunities across the corporation. And we need to reallocate resources versus the best opportunities. And it's also a good way for us to augment this with organic growth through merger and acquisition playbook that I will talk about in a second.\r\nSo first of all, here is what we have been doing, and this is an important slide because a lot of work went into, what I would call, put 3M in order for making sure we are very well prepared for the future.\r\nSo first of all, as you recall, back in 2011 and before, we had 6 big sectors as a company. We went to 5 business groups. And it was all based on relevance to customers, be easier to do business with and link our capabilities to the markets, be able to react faster to demand from the customers through their demand and our technology platforms, our ability to utilize assets better in the company. So it's a big thing when you go from 6 to 5 on the first layer on the organization.\r\nBelow that, we had, what we call at the time, divisions, but think about them like 40 divisions or 40 businesses. We have reduced that to 27 businesses. This is a remarkable move, an important move again in order for us to create scale and customer relevance, to reduce costs through efficiency and productivity in the processes, be able to reallocate resources to better opportunity and accelerate prioritization relative to research and development investment. And you can see here, combining the businesses was very important in many cases in order for us to get the scale in some businesses we have participated in many, many years.\r\nSo when I look upon this, for me and the team, it's an important element to say we are very well prepared for the future, and we have been able to both build out relevance for customer and reduce cost and drive productivity in processes. And the way we have done it is, in some cases, consolidating businesses that we, by definition, in my view, had built not so much on the reality relative for the customer was looking for and what was happening maybe in some consolidation in the marketplace. We were able to allocate resources for bigger opportunities in the company. And as you know, everyone cannot win. You have to make choices, and that is what we have been doing the last couple of years.\r\nAnd then we have also looked upon acquisition and divestiture based on the portfolio, where you have seen some bigger acquisitions like Ceradyne, and in fact, also, the 3M Sumitomo Electric deal we did. But you've also seen some smaller businesses that we have diversed in the company as we moved for the last couple of years. So I think those 3 elements have been very important for us as we looked into the portfolio.\r\nNow you'll recall, we laid out the map in terms of Heartland, Push Forward, and of course, we have something in Strategic Review. And I would like today to just make sure that you understand and know that we are much stronger today in our portfolio than when we started. And there, when you look upon the Heartland and the Push Forward, this is all about protect and improve, and invest for growth. This is an important element of our business, and I will give some comments on both categories here in a second.\r\nSo first of all, the Heartland division. They are -- stand for around 1/3 of the company in sales revenue, and in fact, are accretive to the margins, so very important. It's 5 divisions in the company, and they are large and they are participating in large market with solid growth. They have a very strong global penetration, and they have leading brand positions in their market segments. They are also fundamental in terms of technologies as they are using multiple 3M technologies in the businesses. We look upon this to go from -- back in '12 from $10.5 billion, closer to $13 billion, so around 4.5% to 5% organic local currency growth in the plan. Very, very important piece of our business.\r\nThe Push Forward, the categorization is very similar to the Heartland, but with the difference that they are actually participating in even higher-growth market space. We have very global relevant product portfolio there, and we have category-defining brands. But we are relatively smaller in those segments, meaning, big opportunities. And specifically, I will say, in international, outside of the United States, has also very strong technology foundation and have a high return on investment, meaning, investment here for growth is a very good thing for us. And you can see the growth in this category is 5% to 5.5% in the plan. And we estimate this, where we started from 2012 of $11 billion, to be closer to $14 billion to $15 billion by 2017. So a very, very important part of the business and get a lot of additional investment as we move ahead.\r\nNow we can complement that with mergers and acquisition. And we have complemented not only what's the thinking, but also a playbook relative to this.\r\nSo first of all, relative to the portfolio intent. We would like to bolster the technology position and pursue adjacencies in the Heartland divisions, very important element for us as we move ahead. We would like to build scale and facilitate market penetration for the Push Forward. That is our thinking relative to where we will look for the future. We will build upon that leverage of the 3M fundamental strengths around technology, manufacturing, global footprint and brand. Meaning, if those fundamentals not can drive additional value fast for us, we should probably go away and do something else. It doesn't mean that all 4 of them need to and can add value, but at least 2.5 to 3 should add value. So it's an important element in the playbook.\r\nAnd then when we look upon the markets. The end-market growth should be sustainable and accretive. And of course, we should lever the integration capability to generate value over time in order to maximize value. So when I look upon the work that have been done the last couple of years and the portfolio work and identification of the fundamentals, I feel much better in terms of the playbook, where to look and what to do, and also where not to look and what not to do as we move ahead. So very important element. And it took us some time to come to this point, but the most important metric is not time, it's to get it right and create value for all of you shareholders. So that's the first lever.\r\nLet's then talk about innovation. This is an important element for us, and as I said in the third strategy, start with investing in innovation. This is for us to enhance commercialization effectiveness through customer insight. We need to have good customer insight in order for us to utilize our 46 technology platforms. We will increase R&D investment, but also improve productivity on what we are doing. So this an important element of increased R&D and productivity. And we are going more versus platform development versus single-product solutions. And that's not only us, it's in fact, our customers that are demanding that, and we are responding very well to that.\r\nNow the unique thing with 3M is we have 46 technology platform that are owned by the company, and everyone in the company can use it. They are not owned by 1 division or 1 subsidiary that own the technology platform. This is owned by the enterprise, and everyone can use it in order to combine elements that will provide a solution. And that's an important element of our model, very, very important. So it's unique for us, and it's working very well and have done so for many years. And I will even say, when people talk about open innovation, in a way, 3M have used open innovation internally for many years. But it's also open innovation with our customers because we work with our customers around combining elements here for their success.\r\nNow there's 2 processes in order to make sure we get out what we need. And you look upon the left-hand side, it's a process we call customer-inspired innovation. It's very much around businesses that are designed and spec-in, big key account management and is a customer-specific process. You work with one specific customer around their platform that we provide solution for them.\r\nOn the right-hand side, we have a process called Insights 2 Innovation, or as we call it, i2i. That's very much like consumer insight. It's around everything we do in consumables. And that is around markets. It's not customer-specific, it's around a broad-based market. Those are the only 2 processes used in the company, and that is where it start. It doesn't start with the technology platforms. It starts with customers and markets, rolling back, find solution and then execute that. So very, very important to understand that there is a very robust process in the company in order for us to find the big solutions.\r\nNow as I said earlier, we have made a step change relative to investment in research and development because we are a company that not would like to be commoditized. We are a company that will provide world-class solutions, and that will also make the game of additional investment in research and development.\r\nAnd you can see here, the way we look upon it, when we go from 5.5%, closer to 6%, we will like to do that in disruptive markets and technologies. It's important element because that is also where the company then are spending additional money to make sure product that take longer time, little bit more risky, that we invest in that from the company side as we move ahead.\r\nAnd then when you look upon extending the core platform and expanding into new markets, we continue to do that, and we are very well suited in order to accelerate as we move ahead. And here, we have a couple of example on extending the core platforms around ceramics, that came direct out from the Ceradyne acquisition. And you can, in fact, also see expanding into new markets, that you have also an advanced ceramic for oil and gas that came as base off the Ceradyne acquisition. You see activities in bonding. That is a big element for us, not only for the Industrial business, but also from Electronic and Energy, working with big global customers in the consumer electronics space.\r\nAnd abrasives, that is a incredible platform for us from a technology perspective. But more than that, we have 3 arms to go to market for abrasives. We have automotive aftermarket that go to body shops; we have main industrial, we call abrasive division; and then we have a division called Do-it-yourself. So with the technology around abrasives, we can also go to market with 3 different divisions that are then entering into different channels.\r\nAnd then you see here, powered and supplied air respirators that Frank will talk a little bit more about, that is related into one of our Heartland divisions and doing very well in a big space, as you know.\r\nExpanding into new markets, I talked about advanced ceramics, but we also have here filtration for biopharma that is going into the life sciences sector in filtration. Very, very interesting for us and a business that is doing better and better for us after the acquisition we did many, many years ago. And then filtration of air quality, that you will hear H.C. Shin specifically talk about, which is a big thing in many countries around the world. And think about that not only as air pollution, but to think about also clean water and think about like food safety as big trends going around the world. So very good things going on here.\r\nNow in terms of disrupting markets, we started 2 years ago to accelerate our investment from 5.5%, closer to 6%. We took aside money in the company and we type of invest for divisions that is coming forward with good proposals in terms of disruptive technologies. And up to today, we have approved 30 programs. We approved 19 in 2013, we approved 7 in 2014 and we have already approved 4 going into 2015; 7 of them have a very early-stage commercialization in place. And we estimate that this year, the sales will be around $100 million to $125 million. As you know, this is early stage. And we believe, going into next year, there is maybe 8 other programs that could be in early stage of commercialization. So a very good process. And you see -- and progress. And you see here a couple of them we have highlighted in terms of air barriers, surface modification and analytics. All of them coming out from additional investment in the center of the company for these disruptive technologies so we can disrupt some markets.\r\nNow the third key lever here is around business transformation, and let me give you some comments on that today. This will make sure that we are becoming more agile, more competitive, and most importantly, more relevant to our customers. Ultimately, their business transformation will provide the system and processes for us to drive productivity through our supply chain, to reduce inventory and tax rates, and above all, deliver quicker and greater value to our customers. This is the whole idea, efficiency, productivity, very important for us to be agile, to be able to provide better service to our customer. The backbone of that is a global ERP system, and I would like to give you an update today on that rollout plan.\r\nSo a priority over the last past years of the ERP's implementation has been to learning our new system, to enhance its functionality. As a result, our confidence continues to grow relative to the success. And we have now successfully executed in 5 countries around the world. \r\nWe have also successfully deployed for our Center of Excellence a distribution center in Switzerland and our 4 primary distribution center in West Europe. That's Bedford in the U.K, it's Dabrowa in Poland, it's Essuet [ph] in France and Jüchen in Germany, which is actually an absolute best -- biggest distribution center in West Europe.\r\nIn each deployment in the 5 countries and the 4 distribution center and the Center of Excellence, we have, of course, learned. And one thing we have learned is that we are better served by deployment as we go ahead to do it region by region. So we have started a regional approach, and our focus today is to accelerate and completing the deployment in West Europe, and that will be during the next 2 years. United States will prepare in the meantime and will follow immediately after West Europe.\r\nThe cost for the program for the company will be $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, so up from $800 million, as was previously communicated. However, we believe that the total value will increase as well. And with full implementation, we are now looking for upwards of $700 million in annual operating income improvement and $0.5 billion of structural working capital improvements by 2020. So going very well. We are learning in every execution and deployment. And I personally have gone to all cases where we have implemented it in order to make sure that I myself get the first-hand learning and challenge the team before we move ahead. And the important thing here is actually not -- the metric here is not time, the metric here is customers. So we will never jeopardize any service to customers as we execute this.\r\nNow coming back to the 5 business groups. And today, you will hear from Industrial Business Group by Mike Roman, and you will hear from Frank Little from Safety and Graphics, and then you will also hear about international from H.C. Shin. I will give a couple of comments on the 3 other business groups that are not represented here this morning.\r\nSo first of all, our Health Care business, and as you know, that's a big portion of our business, in fact, the fastest-growing business for us and the highest margins, so by definition, a very nice space. We have done this business for many, many years in 3M. And it's a combination of both, I would say, the medical consumables, to oral care, to drug delivery and to food safety, with health information system around analytics to actually go broad-based of all markets. They, as everyone else, are able to use the technologies in the company, of all the 46 platforms, to find solution, if that is in vascular access, skin integrity or if it's in health care analytics or infection drug delivery system. So very, very good business and very pleased, of course, with the performance from them.\r\nThe evolution of the business, you can see here, go back to 2012, this was then slightly over $5 billion, $5.1 billion, now is $5.6 billion. So very good consistent growth. And you see, as I said earlier, a business with very solid and sustainable margins, with 30% plus. When you look upon the mix, you can see that we are very strong in the developed part, with United States of 44% and Europe/Middle East/Africa of 30%.\r\nComing back to the breach of evolution of economies is much more for us to go in the developing economies as we move ahead. And the solution that we are providing here is very attractive as your health care system are evolving and becoming more sophisticated, as proof of our strong position in the developed world. So very good business, we are very pleased with it and constantly delivering and growing.\r\nNext one is our Electronics and Energy market where we have done some significant improvements during the last 2 years, both in terms of consolidation of divisions, optimizing the footprint internally in the company and becoming more relevant to our customers.\r\nAnd you can see here, this is today 5 division, down from almost 8, I think, when we started. This was a very important element for us, specifically electronics market, which is a very fast-growing market and requiring responsiveness from any supplier with speed. This is a good business for us because it's all technology-driven. We know how to do that. It is soon as you're expecting on a platform, next step is coming crossed out. We know how to do that. So this is a very, very good business for us. And both the electronic market, in the way we define it with our products, which is a $48 billion market; and the energy market, that the way we define it, is a $45 billion market, is very, very attractive for us.\r\nAnd when you look upon the performance here, you can see we about turned the curve in terms of growth back from 2012 and before. And in fact, also, we have improved margins quite a bit. And this is a realization of this matter. But you can see, it's running basically at around 20%. And as we have said in our guidance, we believe that this year, they will be in the high teens in terms of operating income, and I think that's where we will end up in there. But this is a big, big turnaround from the business.\r\nYou can also see here then, due to the electronic piece, that APAC is, of course, geographically a big piece of this business. But don't make the mistake of saying all the specs in or many of the specs in need to be done out of places around the world. So that's where the production is happening. They're personally very pleased with this business and the evolution that we have done during the last almost 3 years now in terms of making sure that this is a solid good business for us as we move ahead.\r\nAnd then finally, our Consumer Business Group that is the business that, for many people, we are most known for due to the brands around Post-it and Scotch. But this is a very good business for us in terms of what we can do to haul away from consumers, making sure that we understand where the shoppers are going for the future because they would go different places and then link that into the channel partners as we move ahead. Our brands here around Scotch-Brite, Command, ScotchBlue, Scotch, Post-it, ACE, Futuro, Nexcare, Filtrete, Scotchgard and Thinsulate are very well-known brand and are, in all cases, category leaders in those channels. Very good plan for us in this business. And again, as you look upon the performance here, it's a business that are growing maybe on the low end to the rest of the businesses for us, on the other hand, very good margins.\r\nAgain, going back to the roadmap of evolution of economies. When you look upon this, with U.S. standing for 56% of the mix, this business will accelerate in international as that business -- those countries evolve in their economies. So feel very good about this business as well and very pleased with Mike Vale and his team relative to the evolution there.\r\nYou can see here that one big piece of the market here is Do-it-yourself and is accelerating. Our Do-it-yourself business, which is around Filtrete, is growing very fast and is one of the Push Forward businesses in the corporation. And again, much, much bigger and much stronger in the United States than outside of the United States. We have some incredible upside here as we move ahead. In that business, you should think about Filtrete, Command and Blue Scotch as the main products. And I think we are 10% plus in growth as we go and very profitable.\r\nSo by that, I hope you have got a better understanding this morning relative to our playbook that all started with a vision and our strategies that are now operationalized in the company, I would say, broad-based and very deep in each business, commitment to business conduct, and we don't take that lightly, I can tell you that. And then our leadership behaviors that we revamped in the beginning of this year and moved from something we call earlier around 3M leadership attributes. And we also believe that behaviors will drive us in a different way as leaders versus attributes. And then as I talked about, the 3 key levers, and you will hear about the 3 of them from the presentations here shortly of how they are utilizing in their businesses and in international.\r\nSo I end then just by telling you that -- here to inform you that we are on a good track. The 3M machine is working. And what we laid out on the 8th of November of 2012 relative to our being active in the plan, we are on track to meet that.\r\nSo by that, I thank you. And then I have the pleasure to introduce Frank Little, that is our Executive Vice President for Safety and Graphic business. So thank you very much.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Inge, for that excellent overview of the company. It's my pleasure to join you this morning and talk about our Safety and Graphics business group.\r\nFirst, I think it's important to understand that Safety and Graphics is very well-positioned to bring the vision that Inge explained to you to life for the company. We participate in every element of that vision.\r\nLet me share the components of our business group with you.  We're a dynamic set of great 3M businesses. First, at $2.4 billion in sales, is our personal safety business, an industry-leading personal protective equipment player. Next, at $1.5 billion in sales, is our traffic safety and security business, a market leader in reflective sheeting and public security solutions. At $1.5 billion in sales, our commercial solutions business is a leader in graphic films and commercial cleaning solutions. And finally, at $0.3 billion in sales, is our industrial mineral products business, a provider of granules used in the roofing shingles market.\r\nNot only do we have a strong set of businesses, but we're also growing and highly profitable. We have built solid organic local currency growth of 4%, while increasing margins to be accretive to 3M. Our portfolio is well-balanced among our businesses, with size and scale on each business area. And we're also reasonably well balanced geographically, with almost 2/3 of our business outside the U.S., with size and scale in each region. Because of this, we are well positioned to grow in both developed and developing economies.\r\nWe not only have the power of the 3M brand, but also several well-known sub-brands and trademarks, which have real meaning to our customers. The 3M brand is a leader in workplace safety. With over 40 years of leadership in the industry, a majority of professionals have a high degree of familiarity with our brand, as well as choose us as a leading brand. We also have strong preferred sub-brands, such as Peltor in hearing communications; and Speedglas in welding protection. Similarly, the 3M brand is also strong in traffic safety, with over 75 years of leadership in this industry. Here, our Diamond Grade trademark sheeting leads the industry in performance. 3M is also well-known with the commercial cleaning space, with our Scotch-Brite and Scotchgard sub-brands have been trusted for over 50 years to solve the toughest cleaning and protection challenges.\r\nWe are also fortunate that our safety businesses are well-positioned to capitalize on the sizable growing safety regulation trend around the emerging world. This map depicts the state of safety regulations and enforcement in the world today. Green represents strong regulations and enforcement, with many of which 3M was widely involved in consultative manner in establishing. Dark gray is where standards and regulations are developing and enforcement is accelerating. And light gray is where regulations and enforcement are embryonic and beginning to gain awareness.\r\nOver -- mining accidents, for example, result in over 33 deaths each day. Falls account for 37% of the deaths in U.S. construction. And there are over 1 million traffic-related deaths, with 92% of those happening in developing countries. As these areas develop, we see huge potential for growth by working with our customers to develop products that help prevent these tragedies.\r\nOur workplace safety and traffic safety businesses are industry-leading consultants with regulatory agencies and industry customers. Teams work worldwide to develop and ensure compliance with the appropriate safety standards, and we'll be well-positioned to benefit from the macro trends of adoption to higher standards in regulation. We continue to invest in our significant global expertise and resources supporting this trend as we work to make the world a safer place.\r\nNow as with 3M overall, we are focused on using the 3 key levers that Inge spoke about of portfolio management, investing in innovation and business transformation, to drive continual improvement in our business. Let me start by describing how we are accomplishing effective portfolio management by focusing on 4 key markets, increasing customer relevance within those markets and prioritizing for profitable growth.\r\nWe have carefully chosen these 4 key markets from which to focus our customer engagement. In safety, we are advancing worker's safety, security and productivity, addressing a $33 billion market opportunity. Among market segments which span most industries, we are focusing on growth in the chemicals and pharma, general manufacturing, construction, engineering and utilities, and transportation safety.\r\nOur next market in commercial solutions is where we enhance our customers' delivery of their brand experience in a $42 billion market opportunity. We are aligning around hospitality, retail stores, construction, food service and transportation fleet management segments within this area.\r\nWe are also helping government customers improve traffic safety and public security, a $20 billion market opportunity. We're focusing our capability on traffic safety, public security, intelligent transportation systems and transportation infrastructure segments. \r\nAnd then finally, our fourth market area is mining, oil and gas, where we are early in consolidating small market-focused activities from across the company as we work to bring solutions from 3M to our customers. Our market opportunity is over $28 billion in this area across all segments of the production process.\r\nNow in addition to refining the scope of our market focus, we've also done much work to prioritize our business portfolio. We've moved from 9 businesses to 5 by rationalizing, combining and integrating to become more capable and efficient. We started with the creation of our market-focused Mining, Oil and Gas organization, enabling us to bring one face of support and all of 3M's technologies to customers in these industries. We combined our Track and Trace, Security Systems and Traffic Safety businesses to enable us to bring a more comprehensive suite of solutions to our customers in the government markets. And this year, we also combined our Commercial Graphics, Building and Commercial Services, and Architectural Markets divisions to help us play bigger with a more relevant set of solutions to enhance the brand experience for our customers. All of these actions have helped us build scale, add customer relevance and become more competitive.\r\nThe foundation for our Safety and Graphics business group is the personal safety business. It is a Heartland business that Inge spoke of earlier. We've been on a transformative journey, leveraging our fundamental strengths within 3M, along with specific acquisitions to move from a respiratory protection leader to a personal protective equipment leader. As we've done this, we've built a global network of 7-platform development labs. We have integrated and invested to create a global supply chain, where more than 65% of our products are supplied from within the region of purchase. We've dramatically grown our global business so that over 75% of our sales comes from our international operations. And we've built the equity of 3M's brand and safety industry over 40 years to become the most-trusted brand globally. All of this has allowed us to strengthen our portfolio within this business to deliver on our commitment of customer-relevant breadth with industry-leading depth.\r\nNow our combination of 3 businesses into the traffic, safety and security business allowed us to leverage 3M's fundamental strengths to bring more attractive solutions to our government customers across the traffic, safety and security market segments. We can now leverage one innovation pipeline, leveraging prioritization to drive larger scale programs. We have built hardgoods and software scale in this business, we have world-class project management and a global network of government relations teams to help us build customer engagement around the world. As a result, we now have significant critical mass and capability from which to build our customer relevance.\r\nSimilarly, our combination of 3 businesses into the commercial solutions business allowed us to leverage 3M's fundamental strengths to bring more attractive solutions to our commercial customers. We can now leverage a single innovation pipeline, driving technology and programs of greater scale and impact. We now have local teams and greater scale to deliver novel growth programs, such as our brand owner experiences offering; a better global supply chain capability and capital equipment leverage; and a broader set of solutions to help our customers deliver their brand experience. As a result, we now have stronger programs and more capability from which to build our customer relevance in the most attractive market segments.\r\nNow let me transition to share more about our second lever for improving our business: Investing in innovation. Here, our efforts are focused on extending and leveraging our core platforms, accelerating game-changing innovation and expanding our global knowledge centers.\r\nWithin Safety and Graphics business group, we have 3 major technology clusters which are deployed across our businesses. We show some examples on this page. For example, our non-woven technology enables superior filtration capabilities in respirators and fluid filtration, as well as controlled scouring capability in cleaning pads. Our tapes and films technology enables better performance in our Scotchlite trademark reflective tapes for garments, spectral reflective graphic films and our Diamond Grade reflective sign sheeting. And finally, our systems and hardgoods expertise is powering the development of advanced active safety solutions, license plate recognition systems and biometrics tracking systems.\r\nNow we are also introducing game-changing innovation and new products across our portfolio. Within the personal safety business, for example, the newly launched Versaflo powered and supplied air system addresses a growing number of extremely hazardous environments requiring respiratory protection. Applications such as mining, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, refining, and of course, health care with such recent threats like Ebola, are all driving significant growth within a $4 billion category.\r\nAnother example is our fall protection rescue systems. This is a unique solution to the need for self-rescue of workers who have suffered an arrested fall in remote locations. Typical for 3M, we are bringing new innovation to expand our penetration into this highly profitable and strong product growth category. With this type of innovation, we are addressing a $1.5 billion product category.\r\nWithin government markets, I'd like to introduce a few other examples of game-changing innovation. We're introducing a new generation of reflective sheeting technology, utilizing a proprietary new manufacturing construction for a large part of our product range. This technology offers increased brightness, along with embedded security features, as well as increased throughput when using digital printing for our sheeting converters. Once again, we are raising the game in our approach to reflective sheeting materials, driving accelerated growth in a $1.6 billion category.\r\nAnother example is our new multimodal biometrics platform, which addresses a trend in biometric security space that really is getting after allowing multiple modes of assessment and validation. This new-generation system provides a step-change improvement in our facial recognition capabilities and integrates the ability to address the fingerprint, iris and facial recognition assessment in one system, without sacrificing our capabilities for accuracy and speed. This program addresses a fast-growing $4 billion category.\r\nWithin our commercial solutions business, we have a strong complement of technology focused on creating and maintaining surfaces in many challenging applications. As a leader in graphic film for brand owners, we are continuously introducing relevant new products to the market. Our Envision films feature sustainable non-PVC film structures that expand the technology to a broad array of printing processes. These products have revolutionary high performance and workability, increasing labor productivity with both traditional and nontraditional surfaces. By raising the bar once again, we will strengthen our leadership in this $2 billion category.\r\nNow the groundbreaking innovation is with our new sustainable family of clean and protect products. These products use advanced materials and nanotechnology to clean, while simultaneously creating a protective layer across various surface cleaning and treatment applications. This layer allows our customers to use less chemicals and less effort in the maintenance of the surface, with some customers experience a reduction of 30% to 50% in the time it takes to clean. Already introduced for glass and for stone floors, we will extend this technology to other challenging surface. With this suite of products, we can address a broader opportunity in this $5 billion product category.\r\nAnd then finally, as we work to bring 3M technology to our customers in the mining and oil and gas markets, I'd like to highlight a couple of game-changing innovation programs here. First, we're bringing game-changing innovation in the area of active safety. Our customers need a better way of ensuring employees are properly protected and productive on the job. Our active safety platform represents a new revolutionary approach to assessing and monitoring personnel protective equipment usage, fit, maintenance and standards compliance in demanding applications. The platform is cloud-enabled and is currently in beta testing with a major mining company. We see this as an important emerging need and macro trend in many industries, and we expect to address a $200 million emerging growth opportunity here.\r\nAnother example of game-changing innovation is our new approach to the sand screen filtering and produce water management in deep downhole well applications. This utilizes ceramics technology from the Ceradyne acquisition, another example of cross-technology leverage, like Inge pointed out before, across all of our businesses, which addresses a critical need for more durable and higher-capacity sand filtration systems, replacing the current metals technology, which is subject to accelerated wear- and fatigue-based failures. This technology enables longer uptime, better capacity in deeper well depth operation, allowing us to address $100 million growth opportunity.\r\nNow let me transition to the third lever that we're using to drive value across our business in business transformation. Within this, we are using our approach to drive operational excellence, improve our business processes and building our capability across the globe. Business transformation is enabling Safety and Graphics to increase operational excellence. This approach enables a lower cost-to-serve model through the integration of business services, improved responsiveness and service for customers as we adopt best practices across the global organization, accelerated time to launch for new global products as our data transparency increases, and gives us better quality and more responsive decision-making as we gain insight from more consistent data inputs. All this allows us to speed development of critical capabilities and allows us to implement a stronger customer insights and customer-relevant innovation model in our business. We continue to use collective business transformation activities to improve the competitiveness of the Safety and Graphics business group.\r\nSo utilizing the strong 3M brand and sub-brands, capturing the clear market opportunity for safety and utilizing the 3 key levers for improving our competitiveness, we are continuing on our transformational journey of: Integrating and consolidating our business to bring more customer relevance, investing in game-changing innovation in our focus markets, driving operational excellence and building business capability around the world and becoming an even stronger, more accretive growth engine for 3M.\r\nSo in conclusion, Safety and Graphics is well-positioned to deliver all the elements of 3M's vision to our customers, whether it is technology advancing every company via secure ID credentials and verification systems, or personal protective equipment safeguarding workers; 3M products enhancing every home via cleaning products and surface materials and treatments; 3M innovation, improving every life via respirators that help protect people from harmful pollution, and reflective sheeting signage that protects people on the roads, our range of capabilities truly brings the complete 3M vision to life. \r\nThank you for your support for 3M. And now, let me introduce Mike Roman who will discuss our Industrial Business Group.\n\n---\n\nAll right. Thanks, Frank. Good morning. It is my pleasure to present the 3M Industrial business. We are a business group that has delivered strong performance over the past 3 years, and again, in 2014.  The strong performance comes from what we do everyday to bring the 3M vision of advancing every company, enhancing every home and improving every life to life in 3M industrial markets.  Let's start with an overview of our Industrial Business Group. \r\nWe're an $11 billion business growing at 1.5x IPI in a $90-plus billion marketplace. We have a proven ability to create value by leveraging the 3M fundamental strengths of technology, manufacturing, global footprint and brand. We're winning with commercial excellence in how we engage our customers, transform our channels and focus on strategic global markets. We're executing portfolio management to increase customer relevance, growth and enterprise value. We're investing in innovation to create differentiated high-impact new products that help us gain profitable market share in both new and existing markets. And we're increasing our competitive advantage through business formation. I'm going to cover each of these strategies and priorities in my presentation today. \r\nSo here, you can see that strong performance reflected in 5% growth on both the top and bottom line. That growth comes from industry-leading positions in product platforms, abrasives, adhesives, tapes and advanced materials. It also comes from a mix of high-growth market-facing businesses in automotive, aerospace and filtration. That growth also comes from a mix of market-leading positions in every region in the world. \r\nOur businesses, taken together, form an industrial powerhouse with broad market reach, unique technologies and leading brands. We operate in the most attractive industrial  markets around the world and we outgrow them. We leverage a majority of 3M technologies to create differentiated industrial product platforms, and we go-to-market with industry and category-leading brands. \r\nWhen you look at the front end of our business, we successfully engage customers through multiple go-to-market models. Our industrial businesses serve a wide variety of customers, from large global OEMs to small local customers. We do this through multiple go-to-market models ranging from direct sales to global key accounts, to industrial distribution to e-commerce. \r\nWhen you step back and look at our products sales at a high level, it can be divided into 2 categories. The majority of our sales comes from what we call designed-in or specified products. Examples of this would be products that would go into the building materials for manufacturing of appliances. It might also be products that are specified in the process to refurbish aircraft. \r\nOn the consumables side, you'd see products like abrasives and tapes that are used in general manufacturing and construction processes. In order to win across this wide variety of customers and these go-to-market models and in these designed-in consumable spaces, we need to focus on these key areas. So we're focused on accelerating our designed-in sales, we're focused on improving our key account management. \r\nWe're partnering with converters and storefronts. Converters are customers who buy jumbo rolls of our materials and then convert them into form factors that are used in the manufacturing of -- by their customers and their manufacturing processes. These are typically finished goods manufacturers. Storefronts are outlets all over the world that serve those small local customers. A good example of this would be [indiscernible] in Latin America. We're also aligning to changes in the B2B channels. A good example of this is accelerating growth that we see through e-commerce. \r\nFor the rest of my presentation, I want to highlight our strategies and priorities through the eyes of our 3 key levers. So let's start with portfolio management. Portfolio management for us is really about prioritization, and we're leveraging prioritization in our portfolios, in our businesses, and now, down to our product level. We're focusing on key markets and geographies, we're focusing on priority customers, and we're focused on winning against critical global, regional and local competitors. \r\nHere, you can see pictured how that prioritization shows up across our business group. On a portfolio level, we continue to look at our divisions, and I'll highlight some examples on how we are managing our division level -- our business level portfolio. We're also going down to the product level and prioritizing the highest growth opportunities there, and I'll cover each of these in a little more -- in just a moment. But we're also looking at our portfolio of leveraging pricing strategy to align the best mix to the local markets -- the best mix of our business to the local markets. We're focused on playbooks for both developed and developing markets, and I'll highlight some examples of this in just a moment. And then we're looking and focused on the priorities that we'll win in key markets around the world. \r\nKey accounts, as I said, are a key focus for us, both global and local key accounts. But we're also driving channel strategies like e-commerce to make sure we deliver best-in-class service to all of our customers. And we're taking our analysis and focus on competitors deeper, driving action plans against those critical global, regional and local competitors. You take all this together, and we're taking our prioritization broader and deeper to help drive growth and create greater value. \r\nAs I said, portfolio management, at a business level, is still critical. It's helping us, as Inge said, to increase relevance with our customers and create greater shareholder value. In 2014, we combined a couple of our businesses into other businesses in the Industrial Business Group. We integrated our personal care business into our industrial adhesives and tapes business to take advantage of synergies on both the front end and the back end of those 2 businesses. We also realigned our defense markets business with the Ceradyne integration. And as I said, we're taking this portfolio management down to the product level. We've identified the highest growth opportunities and we shifted a significant portion of our R&D, SG&A and capital investments to those priority growth opportunities. \r\nAs I said we've got playbooks for the highest priority countries in both developed and developing markets. Our global teams are working with our country teams to develop very sharply focused playbooks, which identify where we want to play: Markets, customers and geographies; and then, what it's going to take to win, what is the best playbook to win. In our developed economies and markets, we're focused on winning share. In our developing markets, we're focused on increasing penetration and driving accelerated growth. And we're executing all of this with a Plan-Do-Check-Act discipline, which is helping us to outgrow those markets across the world. \r\nLet's turn to investing in innovation. In Industrial business, in our investment in innovation strategies, we're shifting investments to those high-impact new projects. We're building new platforms based on customer insights, using processes like customer-inspired innovation. We're accelerating the growth of something that I'm calling, new core product platforms, and I'm going to explain this in a little more detail in just a moment. And then we're driving consistent execution globally and locally. \r\nTo really see the impact of our investments in innovation, I think it's important to step back and look at what's going on in growth in the introduction phase, as well as the growth phase of a product life cycle. That introduction phase is vital to us in 3M. We have to continue to grow this year-over-year. We focus our innovation here on global new products for new and existing markets and also on reinventing ourselves in the local -- with local new products. \r\nReally, most of our products continue to grow well past this introduction phase, some of these become game changers. Those game changers really reshape the core of our product platforms. They become new core for us. And we need to leverage the high growth from these new core platforms and make sure we're prioritizing our investments there. In all of this, we're trying to focus on maximizing our R&D investment and prioritize the highest impact projects. So one of the ways we prioritize these projects is through customer insights. And as Inge highlighted, we use 2 processes to really develop those customer insights. We use customer-inspired innovation for our designed in products and we use i2i for our consumable products. \r\nAs Inge highlighted, that CII process is a very much a one-to-one deep engagement with our customers. It leads to innovative new products and applications. The products you see pictured here are products we introduced in 2014 based on that process. Lightning Strike Protection Film for use in the construction of composite aircraft. New Advanced Ceramics Friction Shims, which help to reduce the weight and improve the performance of automobile transmissions. And then new attachment systems as our customers in the automobile industry bring in new materials that require new bonding solutions. \r\nOn the i2i side, our consumable products, one of the great applications of this, looking across a broad customer set, is the simplification that we did in our masking tape portfolio. We went from more than 2 dozen masking tape -- 2 dozen masking tape products, down to a simplified portfolio of 5, and we're driving double-digit growth off of that simplification. We're also using i2i to expand our pain application systems and, actually, to introduce entirely new platforms like the air barrier product portfolio that you see pictured here. So engaging our customers this way really helps drive our innovation and helps to prioritize our best ideas. \r\nFocusing on these insights is also helping to fill up our product pipeline with high-quality new products. These are 3 different categories of investments that we're leveraging to drive innovation. The first in investing innovation is leveraging corporate-sponsored investments, as Inge talked about, to introduce new products for new markets. An example of that is Liquid Air Barrier we introduced in 2014 to help build-out that air barrier portfolio. We also introduced an entirely new class of  protective films called Crystal Silk for use in the manufacturer of both electronics and appliances. \r\nIn our industrial businesses, we're working on extending our platforms into new markets and new applications. A great example is our glass bubble platform. This year we've introduced new and differentiated performing glass bubbles that extend into new markets and new applications. We also are taking our Cubitron II precision-shaped ceramic grain technology from our coated abrasives applications into other applications like cut-off wheels you see pictured here. And then our local R&D efforts and teams are focused on reinventing close to the customer. And here, you see a couple of examples, 1 from our Korea team on Interam insulated matting, which is used in the manufacture of catalytic converters, and also residential water filtration for the China market. Expanding our product platforms into these high-growth opportunities is a big advantage from all of these investments. \r\nSo here, I've highlighted some examples of what I'd call the new core platforms for our Industrial business. Each of these new core platforms has, in common, that they leverage deeply the 4 fundamental strengths from 3M. Technology, manufacturing, our global capabilities and brand. The first one, investing -- based on some investments to innovate new structural adhesives, we now have the most compressive adhesive portfolio in the world. We're leveraging that to drive double-digit growth in key markets. In 2009, we introduced Cubitron II, the precision-shaped ceramic grain technology, into coated abrasives. This was a whole new -- really created a whole new category of performance. We're now taking that same technology and that same advantage in performance into precision-bonded abrasives like the cut-off wheel I saw -- you saw pictured earlier. But also, into precision grinding and finishing products, like the products pictured here that we added with the Winterthur acquisition. \r\nWe've been innovating and continue to innovate in our Thinsulate platform, and we're leveraging that now to bring the best-in-class acoustic solutions to automobile construction. \r\nSo we take these 3 new core platforms for Industrial Business Group. Together, they'll deliver more than $600 million over the next 3 years. \r\nLet's turn to our last lever, business transformation. We'll leveraging business transformation to become more effective and efficient in how we serve our customers. We're using it to drive improvements in our supply chain performance in our cost of goods sold. It really is extending our competitive advantage. \r\nOn the front side of our business, customer-facing side, it;s helping to create best-in-class fulfillment. It's providing complete visibility for our customers across the supply chain. It's helping us to drive increased growth and productivity. On the supply chain side, we're leveraging global lean value streams and a coordinated global supply to improve our cycle times and inventory turns. All of this is transforming our customers' experience and helping us to drive down the cost to serve and cost to supply. And while we're implementing those business transformation strategies, we're working everyday in our businesses to optimize our supply chain and reduce our cost of goods sold. \r\nIn our supply chain, we are leveraging those Centers of Excellence Inge talked about to reduce cycle times, improve our plant and asset utilization and increase our inventory turns. Reducing COGS is critical to our future performance and carrying that strong performance forward. We're leveraging Lean Six Sigma and disruptive cost-out innovation to improve our productivity, improve our yields and reduce our waste. Delivering this continuous improvement in COGS is how we fund those investments in innovation. \r\nSo these strategies and priorities are how we are bringing the 3M vision to life in industrial markets. They are how we will continue this strong performance well into the future, growing our global industrial powerhouse to over $15 billion in sales by 2019. Thank you. \r\nI'll now turn it over to H.C. Shin for update on international operations. Thanks, H.C.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Mike. Good morning, everybody. My great pressure to talk about international operations. So I'm going to talk about landscape a little bit, how we are responding to kind of a tumultuous landscape. Talk about strategy a little bit, and then how we execute. \r\nInternational is a strong and sustainable growth platform. The size of $20 billion in sales this year, 23% operating income. We're operating in 72 subsidiaries. We have laboratories in 35 countries with over 4,000 R&D employees located outside the United States. Our ability to reach end-user customers, anywhere in the world, by the people who really understand the local culture, is the reason why these global capabilities is 1 of 4 fundamental strengths of the company. \r\nOver the past 5 years, we're able to grow at 5%, strong growth record, organic local currency to sales with top $20 billion this year, with 23% operating income. Our plan is to continue the growth momentum into the next several years, 6% organic local currency growth for the next several years. And the growth will come from both developing and developed economies. Very critical that we grow both in developing and developed, and we have a playbook to win in both developing and developed economies. \r\nThere are lots of dynamics happening, as you know, around the world in any given year, ranging from local currency devaluation, all the way to tumultuous geopolitical events or even natural calamities. 3M has a well laid out playbook to respond to this situation very quickly and very effectively when they arise. For example, in 2014, we successfully overcame severe local currency devaluation around the world through very disciplined pricing management actions, meaning increases in most cases, right? We also managed our cash flow and balance sheet very effectively in abnormal circumstances like in Venezuela, again, by the people who have done this before and who know exactly what to do under the circumstances. \r\nSo let's talk about strategy. We are basically operational in corporate strategy, 6 strategies. Our guiding principle is around 3 strategic levers, namely portfolio management, investing in innovation and business transformation. In doing so, we were able to post a strong financial result. Year-to-date September, our organic local currency growth was 4.5% at 23% operating income. Our growth momentum is accelerating, and our strong operational excellence discipline continues to drive margin. \r\nOur strategies are powered by our people. People are at the center of our global strategy execution. To attract highly qualified and diverse global talent, we put in place some very unique and innovative hiring practices. For example, we have a targeted international Ph.D. hiring program from many top universities around the world. We also are tapping international society for female engineers. We also have a program to hire highly qualified Saudi nationals in U.S. colleges, train them in the United States and send them back to Saudi Arabia to work in 3M operation in the kingdom. Once we hire the people, then, we really develop them through comprehensive leadership training programs, both in terms of specialty area, as well as general leadership programs. So we'll continue to invest in people and leadership development. \r\nSo let's talk about 3 key strategic levers, starting from portfolio management. Over the past 2.5 years, 3 years, under Chairman's direction, we vigorously implemented portfolio management strategy in International. Our actions were focused on shifting resources and headcount toward Heartland and Push Forward divisions. We also allocated capital differently based upon portfolio priorities. We also put R&D investment and M&A in different buckets relative to portfolio priorities. In doing so, our Push Forward divisions are now growing at the fastest, 6%, followed by Heartland divisions at 4%. In implementing this portfolio management strategy, we were able to generate more sustainable domestic demand-driven businesses like Health Care, Consumer Retail and Personal Safety businesses, which obviously helped us build more balanced portfolio mix in our business. \r\nOur geography portfolio plan calls for growing 9% in developing market and 3% in developed market. The core essence of our growth strategy in these 2 markets is to convert local and regional megatrends -- there are lots of them by the way, to faster commercialization. And for example, in developing markets, we can really capitalize on air quality in many countries, or water quality, big problem around the world. Food safety, a huge issue in many countries. Infrastructure building. So those are the types of society-defining megatrends that we can turn into faster commercialization in developing markets. \r\nSame is true in developed market like in West Europe. We can also capitalize on opportunities like sustainability, energy savings or health care solutions relative to aging populations. That's how we want to grow in both developing and developing -- developed markets. \r\nThese are the top 15 countries and regions where most of the growth will come from in the next few years. So we can see the countries here: China, Southeast Asia, Brazil, Korea, Japan, Mexico and a few countries in West Europe. So those are the countries where most of growth will come from, kind of our usual suspects, as you can imagine. \r\nI'm going to specifically talk about China, Southeast Asia, Japan and West Europe in my following slides, starting from China. We have been operating in China since 1984. We have a very large and very profitable business, over $4 billion business. We have a very good and very large manufacturing supply chain and R&D footprint in China.  But you know what, we concluded that we can do more in China. Hence, the creation of so-called new China plan in 2012, 2 years ago. New China plan callid for growing our business in China from $4 billion to $5.5 billion by doing things differently. There are 4 things that we are doing differently now: First, we invest more in local megatrend-driven product development and marketing in China to really take advantage of their domestic-driven economy. Number two, we expand regionally into West region particularly and North region. Third, we also focus on productivity improvement using Lean Six Sigma discipline. So it's not just growth, we're also focusing on productivity in addition to growth. And then, we continue to invest in our human capital capabilities. So those are the 4 things that we do differently to bring China to the next level. \r\nOur new China plan is fundamentally based upon much deeper and more systematic understanding of China as a country. As China continues to evolve to the next stage of economic development as was stipulated in 12th 5-year economic plan, we see a vast array of opportunity to convert those domestic megatrends to commercialization. For example, we are already investing heavily in air quality programs, water purification issues, water quality problems or health care programs, automotive, and they're getting some great success from these programs. All domestic, all indigenous toward China local megatrends. I'll just take  one example to get a little deeper into the program to explain what I mean by very local domestic programs. The air quality issue in China is well-known. It is an environmental issue and health issue at the same time. People in Beijing or Shanghai wake up in the morning and start the day by checking what they call AQI or Air Quality Index. So we can see the number here. The safe level of AQI is considered around 50. And as you can see in the chart, in many days, in many cities, it's well beyond 130 or 150. So public awareness is clearly there. \r\n2 years ago, 3M introduced consumer respirator program. The program is designed to provide proprietary 3M respiratory protection technology to general Chinese consumers. Again, the product was designed, manufactured in China at a price point that should be affordable to general China consumers. Then we made them available ubiquitously. They can buy it in the supermarket. They go to drug store, they can pick it up. They can go to mass retailers, they can buy it. Or through a website like alibaba.com. We are already having a great success in year 2. In fact, just this opportunity alone, the air quality in China could be multi-hundreds of millions dollars opportunity, very profitable for 3M. \r\nSo this is our playbook. This is how we're going to grow in China. Growing with the economy, growing with society. And we can replicate to other megatrends, like water quality or food safety. Or we can take the example in China and replicate in Indonesia, for example. So this is how 3M will continue to grow in developing market. \r\n3M Japan is the second largest subsidiary of 3M, with $2.2 billion sales. As you know, the country went through tragic tsunami event in 2011 and, recently, very severe local currency devaluation. Now [indiscernible] just responding to the situation in Japan, our team in Japan, I think is thriving in this challenging landscape. 3M Japan, which became, as you know, wholly-owned subsidiary of 3M recently, is in great shape. They are outgrowing market, outgrowing IPI in a big way. In fact, it is expected that 3M Japan will finish 2014 with 10.4% organic local currency growth at 33% operating income. So we are very proud of our team in Japan and quite happy about our operation in Japan. How did they do that? Again, by focusing on portfolio, simplification, portfolio management, to less and do it well. At the same time, also focused on megatrends like domestic, Health Care, Consumer Retail as well as Personal Safety. \r\nSoutheast Asia is a growing region. This could be the next growth platform for 3M. We already have $1 billion, a very profitable business. And opportunity here is associated with the very large number of emerging middle-class consumers. Oh by the way, over 800 million people who's got money now, ready to spend. \r\nOur strategy here, too, really is to take advantage of our Singapore super hub capability. Since 1998, we invested over $800 million in Singapore to build a very sophisticated  manufacturing and R&D platform. So we can use this to capitalize on megatrend opportunity there, like automotive, we provide more cars there; middle-class income consumers; consumer business; oil and gas; as well as electronics and health care. So our growth momentum in Southeast Asia region is going very well. We have very high expectations for Southeast Asia to continue to grow. \r\nWest Europe is a must-win geography for us. We already have a very large presence, 17% of 3M sales is coming from West Europe. We have a very large footprint. Complete self-sufficient capability in terms of manufacturing supply chain and R&D. If you take a look at West Europe as a marketplace. For us, it's a growth market. They have a very large consumer base, and West Europe is also the home location for numerous number of global corporations who are leading the global trend in the areas like sustainability, like technology, like innovation. And our plan there is simply to follow corporate strategy, focus on portfolio simplification and prioritization; do less, but do it well; and really capitalize on uniquely European innovation. And at the same time, also focus on productivity program, like regionalization, meaning, instead of going country-by-country in small countries, why don't we close the country into more regional structure. At the same time, we also consolidated all of our supply chain footprint in West Europe into 1 location in Switzerland, which I'm going to touch on later. \r\nHere's one example of uniquely European innovation. 3M has an advanced materials solutions, lightweight material. Basically, this is for aerospace and automotive industries. This material and technology that can make things lighter in aerospace parts and automotive parts. And that's a good news from the perspective of sustainability and energy efficiency. Not only do we have 1 technology, we have many technologies to make things lighter and more energy-efficient. I'll just take one example. Glass bubbles. This is a hollow glass microsphere, very small. The diameter of somewhere between 30 to 50 micron. It is a filler material that can be mixed with plastics or composites, and basically made into automotive or aerospace parts can reduce the weight of the parts as much as 15%. And that's a good news for the industry. So we are commercializing this. We have already commercialized this with large aerospace and automotive OEMs in Europe. So people talk about Europe as a slow growth, it is true, but there are high-growth segments in Europe, such as this. This particular segment, which is large, the $2 billion-plus addressable market size is growing somewhere between 8% to 15%. And this is how we're going to grow in developed markets. There are segments that we can unleash 3M technology to take advantage of the trend like sustainability, like lightweight material. That's how we're going to grow in developed economies. \r\nIn terms of investing in innovation, our plan is to continue to invest in R&D, as you heard from our Chairman, and marketing as well. You heard we have lots of ideas, right, in terms of how we grow in local markets, in local megatrend. The reason we are investing in R&D is to convert those opportunities to commercialization. That's why we are increasing and stepping up our R&D investment as far as marketing. For example, we continue to invest in our Customer Technical Centers around the world. Right now, we have 46 Customer Technical Centers around the world. We keep adding 1 or 2 a year, we keep investing in this Customer Technical Centers capability. We are also shifting the center of gravity in our technology development. So right now, corporate research activities was all coming from U.S. Now, we are shifting the center of gravity to locations like China, Germany and Japan. Again, the reason we are doing it is to really take advantage of opportunities residing in the region, residing in those countries. For example, air, water, safety, and the list goes on and on. \r\nI'll just take a couple of examples of what I mean by local megatrend-driven innovation. In Japan, 3M commercialized viscoelastic materials, basically, sticky material, elastic material that can be inserted in the form of damper in between building structure like warehouse. What it does is it maximizes the resistance against vibration caused by earthquake. So that's a very, very good thing for a lot of warehouse structure in Japan, and we are already getting some very, very good success with this particular, very local innovation in Japan. The second one, water purification. We talked about air in China. We're having a very good success with water. Water quality's as much of a problem in China as it is with air quality. So 3M has a very comprehensive air purification capability for house. So what we did is to set up over 2,000 individual kiosks in large cities in China. So consumers can bring their home water sample. They can get a test immediately, right on the spot in the kiosks, they can get a report right on the spot, they can get a recommendation what types of system they need right on the spot. In fact, if they want, they can make a purchase right on the spot.  So these types of program is really unique to China, and we have many, many examples like that, that we call local megatrend-driven innovation. That's how we're going to grow in international, going forward. \r\nIn terms of business transformation, we are able to continue to drive down our cost of goods sold, as you see here, and we were able to do that through rigorous use of Lean Six Sigma. And we are stepping up Lean Six Sigma. We are increasing the number of black belts to take it to the next level to make sure that we continue to focus on productivity improvement, in addition to finding the way to grow. In fact, all of this will be enabled by a single instance global ERP that's now being deployed, and that will be a critical enabler to make all this possible by connecting all the data points around the world in all functions and all countries. \r\nOur supply chain of the future is hinged on the idea that instead of going country-by-country, if we can consolidate all supply chain assets into one location in the region, we can create a lot more -- we can create a lot more productivity, that's the thinking. For example, in EMEA, we established a supply chain Center of Excellence in Switzerland. So now it controls all supply chain assets in EMEA. It's a great thing from the standpoint of asset utilization. In fact, we also selected Singapore as the regional location for Asia-Pacific. We already launched our Panama Pacifico operation in Panama. So these 3 hubs of supply chain will act as a center of excellence to consolidate manufacturing assets to maximize asset utilization. And by the way, those 3 locations happen to be very tax efficient locations. That's how we will modernize and continue to maximize our efficiency in supply chain. \r\nThis is one example. EMEA supply chain in [indiscernible], Switzerland. It consolidate all 49 individual plants under 1 entity now in Switzerland. That covers almost over $6 billion worth of sales value and production. And as our Chairman told you, we successfully deployed ERP in all those locations. What it does is that it really drives asset utilization and drive the cost down in our cost of goods sold. Significant cost saving opportunity in an opportunity like this. Oh by the way, it happens to be located in tax-efficient location. \r\nSo in summary, I think international is a strong and proven growth platform. We have a very strong operational excellence discipline, but we see very large and untapped local market opportunities based upon megatrends. So our plan is to continue to invest in R&D and marketing to commercialize those opportunities. And we are doing all of these through our proud global talents. So that was our story from international. \r\nIt's my pleasure to introduce, Nick Gangestad, the CFO of the company.\n\n---\n\nThank you. Thanks, H.C. Good morning, everyone. I'm Nick Gangestad, 3M's CFO and it is great to be with you this morning. \r\nYou've heard Inge talk about 3M's strategies. You've heard Frank, Mike and H.C. talk about those strategies in execution and how they're impacting our businesses and geographies. And I'll wrap-up the prepared portion of our agenda this morning by covering 3 items: First, I'll give an update on 3M's capital structure and allocation strategy; I'll cover our 2015 earnings outlook; and then I'll give you an update on our 2013 to 2017 5-year plan that we first introduced 2 years ago. \r\n3M has a long history of a strong capital structure and then generating strong cash flow. One year ago, in this very room, we announced an update to enhance 3M's capital structure strategy. We felt that we could lower 3M's total cost of capital by using low-cost debt and return cash to shareholders and invest in our business, investing organically in our business remains our top priority, as evidenced by our investments in research and development, which you've heard everyone before me talk about this morning, as well as CapEx. \r\nTo augment that organic growth, our capital plan -- capital deployment plan calls for $5 billion to $10 billion to be spent on mergers and acquisitions over the 5-year period. We're doing this in a way where we're maintaining flexibility to be able to respond to strategic opportunities as they arise. Those actions started last year, and we're continuing the action in 2014. And I'm going to summarize what we've been doing in 2014 as part of our capital structure, capital allocation strategy. You see them summarized on this slide here, and I'll go into detail in each of these. \r\nFirst, investing in our organic business is our top priority, as evidenced by our investment in research and development and CapEx. As part of our capital deployment plan, we've allowed for research and development expense to move to 6% of revenue by the year 2017. We're earmarking that incremental investment to go towards disruptive innovation that can develop new products for new markets.  \r\nIn 3M, we use a metric, an index called NPVI, New Product Vitality Index, to measure the amount of revenue that 3M is generating from products that have been introduced in the last 5 years. For 2014, we are estimating that index to be 33%. \r\nWe do this investment in innovation to increase our relevance to our customers, and it also creates the benefit of enhancing our operating margins and return on invested capital. \r\nThe second-place we're investing organically in the business is in CapEx, both innovation, which I just talked about, and manufacturing, that I'm talking about now, are 2 of the fundamental strengths that you've heard talked about repeatedly this morning. The way we deploy our CapEx is aligned with our portfolio prioritization process. 3M has flexible manufacturing assets that can be deployed across 3M's product lines, the same manufacturing asset can be manufacturing 3M products across multiple businesses. We're also vertically integrated in that we manufacture many of the raw materials that we use in production. Examples of that are our films and other chemicals that go into 3M -- into 3M products. \r\nWe are going to continue that investment in CapEx. We're expecting in 2015 to spend between $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion on CapEx. And over the 5-year time horizon, we expect our CapEx spending to average approximately 5% to revenue. \r\nM&A is another part of our capital allocation strategy. And I'm going to share a slide that we've shared for the last 2 years. This is where we show how we are doing with the deals that we have -- the M&A deals that we have completed. The message is more or less unchanged. The acquisitions that 3M has completed since 2009 are exceeding our expectations. Our portfolio pipeline is aligned around our prioritization process as well as we're focused on end markets that are accretive to 3M and also have the capability of generating sustainable returns for 3M. Part of our strategy has been to build a center to the -- a central organization within 3M, which can drive 3M integration faster and more effective.  Another part of our pipeline strategy is that we are looking for targets where our 4 fundamental strengths can be used to add value. \r\nWe've also, in 2014, deployed approximately $1 billion to mergers and acquisitions. We have 2 -- the 2 deals we've completed, listed here. We purchased the remaining 25% of our Sumitomo 3M operations, a company that's been in existence over 50 years in which 3M has had 100% control of operation for many of those years. That deployed $865 million of our international cash. And on the right-hand side, we spent approaching $100 million on our Treo acquisition in the health care information systems as a way to accelerate our entry into the health care analytics space. Both of these deals are exceeding our sales and revenue expectations from the time we made that -- the purchases. \r\nThe third part of our capital allocation strategy that we're executing this year is returning cash to shareholders. As Inge mentioned earlier this morning, we announced a 20% increase to our dividend for Q1 2015. That's on top of a 35% increase in 2014. And this moves our payout ratio for 2015 to approximately 15%. We expect that future increases will be in line with earnings growth over the coming years. \r\nShare repurchases are another way we're returning cash to shareholders. We had a range where we were estimating $17 billion to $22 billion over the 5-year time horizon to be allocated to share repurchases. 2 years in, we estimate we will be at approximately $11 billion. Therefore, we're upping the bottom end of that range to $20 billion for a new range over the 5-year period of $20 billion to $22 billion. \r\nOur approach, as we buy back shares is twofold: First, we have a disciplined minimum amount that we are constantly in the market investing in share repurchases; and then we have a second discretionary amount, which fluctuates up or down based on relative value and the other uses of cash we see coming at 3M. Over the 5-year time horizon, we expect this to be 3% earnings accretive to earnings per share. \r\nThe last area I'll talk about, about capital allocation and capital structure, is net debt. There's 2 components to that. First, cash. We've been working to minimize global cash while keeping ourselves flexible. We've been managing our U.S. cash balance to minimal levels. And as you can see on the graph, most of our cash is in our international operations. Part of our strategy is to deploy our cash organically where that cash is being generated. We're working to deploy that cash. This acquisition of Sumitomo 3M Japan is one example of that. We're also -- we also repatriate money from our international companies to the U.S. to the extent we can do it tax efficiently. \r\nThrough the first 9 months of this year, we have increased our net debt by $2.3 billion. We're doing this as part of our strategy to lower our total cost of capital by taking advantage of low-cost debt. This increase in net debt has been a function of the cash reduction which I showed on the other slide, and the issuance of $2.5 billion of term debt during the year. We've had 2 different offerings with terms ranging from 4 years to 30 years, all of them at favorable rates. For 2015, we are expecting to increase our leverage by $3 billion to $5 billion. \r\n3M's pension team is also managing our global pension obligations well. We are largely complete with the structural changes to our defined benefit plans. We have closed most of those plans, migrating them to defined contribution plans. We estimate that we will end this year at an 87% funded level globally, and that's down from the -- from a 94% funded status at the end of 2013. There are 2 primary drivers for that decline: First, we're anticipating approximately an 80-basis-point decline in discount rates in the U.S. for our pension; and second, we're adopting a new mortality table in the U.S. We had been on the BB scale mortality table in the U.S. and we're moving to RP 2014 as of the end of this year.  Our cash contributions we expect to remain relatively flat between $100 million and $200 million per year over the next 3 years. \r\nSo to sum it all up, we see 2015 as another strong year in our capital allocation model. We will have between $15 billion and $17 billion of capital available to 3M coming from our cash flow from operations, excluding R&D, including our cash and marketable securities on hand and including $3 billion to $5 billion of added leverage. Our deployment strategy is also strong. We first will invest in our business, our organic business, with R&D and CapEx approaching $3.5 billion. And over the 5-year time horizon, as I've mentioned before, we expect M&A to be between $5 billion and $10 billion. We also expect 2015 to be another strong year of returning cash to shareholders. \r\nNow let's turn our focus to earnings. Before I talk about our outlook for 2015, I'll just make a few comments about what we're seeing as 2014 comes to an end. We're seeing worldwide organic volume growth tracking in line with recent trends we have seen in 3M. We're continuing to see the U.S. dollar strengthen during the fourth quarter, and we're -- and no surprise, we're seeing commodity prices decline, which will benefit 3M even further into 2015. We're also taking actions during this quarter to rationalize our portfolio. We've taken actions in some of our businesses in Western Europe, which we expect to incur a cost of $30 million in the fourth quarter. And yesterday, we announced the divestiture of our static control business within the E&E business of 3M. We expect that deal to close in first quarter of next year. \r\nNow onto 2015. We're expecting GAAP earnings per share to be between $8 and $8.30. And if I compare that to the midpoint of our current guidance for 2014, that's a 7% to 11% increase in earnings per share. We expect our organic local currency growth to be between 3% and 6%, and we expect the strong dollar to reduce sales in U.S. dollars by 2% to 3% next year. We're expecting our tax rate to be between 28% and 29% next year, and we anticipate free cash flow conversion between 90% and 100%. \r\nHere's our road map on the components that explain how we will go from our current 2014 results to our $8 to $8.30 range next year. And I'll comment on each of these components in the coming slides. But before I leave this slide, I'll just comment on the minority interest components on the far right. \r\nWhen we first announced the acquisition of the remaining 25% of Sumitomo 3M in Japan, of our joint venture with Sumitomo 3M in Japan, we stated that we expected $0.08 earnings per share accretion over the course of the 12 calendar months following that deal. That deal closed on September 1. The first $0.03 of that earnings per share accretion we will have experienced in 2014 and what you've seen noted here is the remaining $0.05 of EPS accretion which we expect in 2015. \r\nNow onto organic growth. We expect organic growth to increase earnings per share for 3M by $0.25 to $0.50. This is based on our estimate that we will grow organic local currency sales by 3% to 6%. That 3% to 6% is largely unit volume-driven. And if you compare that to our estimation of global Industrial Production Index, we're estimating that to be between 2.5% and 3.5%. We expect 3M's growth in developing markets to be between 5% and 10% in 2015, and we expect our growth in developed markets to be between 2% and 5%. Those growth figures I just mentioned are organic local currency growth. \r\nIf I take that growth and break that down by business and geography, Health Care, we're expecting to lead the way for growth in 3M with 4% to 7% organic growth. Our Industrial business, Safety and Graphics business and Consumer business, we are all expecting to grow organically between 3% and 6%. And our Electronics and Energy business, we're expecting to grow between 2% and 6% in 2015. \r\nIf I turn this to look at our growth by geographic area of the world, our largest area of the world, the United States, we anticipate growth between 3% and 6%. EMEA, we are expecting growth between 0% and 4%. The Western European portion of that, we're expecting between negative 2% and positive 2% organic local currency growth with our Central East Europe and Middle East Africa regions being accretive to that overall area growth. Our Asia-Pacific growth, we're estimating between 3% and 8%, with our China growth in the mid- to high-single digits, and our Japan growth in the low-single digits. And then, finally, our Latin America/Canada area, we're expecting to grow between 5% and 8%, primarily driven by growth in Latin America. \r\nNow let's move to the impact foreign currency will have on 3M's earnings. The stronger U.S. dollar we're expecting to reduce earnings per share in 2015 by $0.10 to $0.20, and this is net of hedging. 3M has a strategy of hedging approximately 50% of our economic exposure. One of our actions we took earlier in 2014 was to extend the tenor on our hedging in certain developed market currencies where we moved from 12 year -- 12 months out of economic exposure to 24 months out of economic exposure. \r\nIn the case of raw materials, we're expecting to experience raw material tailwinds for the fourth year in a row in 3M. We're expecting this to increase earnings per share between $0.15 and $0.25. In 3M, we spend approximately $8 billion a year on raw materials and purchased finished goods. And of that $8 billion, approximately $1.5 billion is spent on oil-related derivative raw materials. Total raw materials make up approximately half of 3M's total cost of goods sold or about 25% of our sales are spent on raw materials and purchased finished goods. These savings that I'm talking about here, the $0.15 to $0.25 are being driven by market-driven prices, which we're seeing and experiencing today, is driven by efforts from 3M's global sourcing organization and where appropriate, raw material substitutions. \r\n2015 will be a year in which 3M continues to make strategic investments. It's part of 3M's business model to reinvest in the business to enable even more productivity in the future. So our strategic investments in 2015 will come in 3 areas: First, we're going to continue to invest in our business transformation program, which you've heard talked about. We expect our year-on-year spending on business transformation in 2015 to be flat with what we spent in 2014. We will continue to increase our investment in disruptive innovation, disruptive technology, aimed at creating new products for new markets. And in 2015, we anticipate we will continue to take portfolio actions to improve our portfolio and increase operational efficiency. In total,, these strategic investments, we expect to reduce earnings per share for 3M by $0.05 to $0.10. \r\nNet productivity will be accretive to 3M's earnings per share in 2015. We're expecting productivity to increase earnings per share between $0.10 and $0.20. This will also increase 3M's operating margin by approximately 50 basis points in 2015. There are several things driving this earnings per share benefit. Part of it is our investments in portfolio actions and prioritizations that have already occurred. Part of it is our supply chain Centers of Excellence, which you heard H.C. talk about. But it's also being driven by our efforts around Lean Six Sigma and the increased productivity that we're seeing from those dedicated resources.  And on the next slide, I'll show you what we are doing with resources dedicated to Lean Six Sigma. Our low point for resources dedicated to Lean Six Sigma was in 2011 with 372 people devoted to that -- to those programs. We have been continually increasing our resources going into Lean Six Sigma, and we expect that trend to continue, and we're doing that to drive the savings that you see on the right-hand side. We're seeing those savings increase by approximately 5% per year. And by 2017, we expect that to be approaching $1.5 billion, which is a necessary thing we need to do to offset other costs that are increasing in 3M, such as inflation.\r\nPension will be a headwind for 3M in 2015. We expect our -- the earnings per share impact to reduce earnings per share by $0.10 to $0.20. And as I've mentioned earlier, this will be driven by declines in our discount rate in the United States and the adoption of a new mortality table.\r\nPartially offsetting those declines are a couple of things. First, our return on asset performance in the U.S. will be a benefit. Year-to-date, our asset return in the United States is approximately 13%. This is -- our pension expense next year will also be benefited by plan changes we have made whereby we are offering lump sum payouts to retiring employees. Our assumptions for next year: we are leading our return on asset assumption unchanged at 7.75%. And while this will be an increase in 2015, we anticipate that pension expense in both 2016 and 2017 will be a decline. Over the 5-year time horizon, we expect this to be 1% accretive on average to our earnings per share.\r\nTaxes. We anticipate our tax rate to be between 28% and 29% in 2015. We are targeting that our tax rate will be at 27% by 2017, driven by our structural changes that we are making. You heard H.C. talk about our supply chain centers of excellence that have been established in Europe, in Panama and in Singapore. We expect that those benefits will be a key enabler to move our tax rate to 27% by 2017. Our tax rate guidance for both 2014 and for 2015 are based on the assumption that R&D tax credits will be in place for each of these years.\r\nShare repurchases. This is a continuation of our capital deployment strategy that I talked about earlier. We expect this to improve 3M's earnings per share in 2015 by $0.30 to $0.40. We are estimating that we will deploy between $3 billion and $5 billion in gross share repurchases or $2 billion to $4 billion on a net basis. And over the time frame of the 5 years -- or excuse me, the time frame for 2015, we're expecting our average diluted shares outstanding to decrease by 3% to 4%.\r\nAnd then finally, as you might expect as we add more leverage, more debt to our balance sheet, we are also -- we will be seeing our debt interest expense go up in 2015. We expect that to reduce earnings per share by $0.05 to $0.10. This is all part of our strategy of lowering 3M's cost of capital.\r\nSo to sum this up, we're expecting GAAP earnings per share between $8 and $8.30. We're expecting organic local currency growth between 3% and 6%. We anticipate a tax rate between 28% and 29% and free cash flow conversion between 90% and 100%.\r\nFor the last portion of my agenda, I'm going to talk about our 5-year plan that we talked about in November of 2012. 2015 will mark the midyear point of that 5-year plan, and I thought it would be wise to give an update on how we're seeing the components of that plan developing. There were 4 financial metrics that we discussed as part of our 5-year plan when we introduced that 2 years ago, the first being organic local currency growth. And at that time, we said we expect we should be able to grow organically between 4% and 6%. That was based on 2 assumptions: that the global industrial production would grow between 3% and 4% and using history as a guide, we saw our ability to grow 1.5x Industrial Production Index. That led us to the 4% to 6%. What we are seeing is industrial production tracking to the low end of that range, but fortunately, our ability to outperform industrial production is helping us stay in the 4% to 6% range. We've seen us move from a prior capability of growing 1.5x to approximately 1.7x multiple through the first 3 years of this plan. All of our businesses are contributing to this organic growth range, and we are on track to 4% to 6% organic growth over the 5-year time horizon.\r\nThe second financial metric we shared was earnings per share growth between 9% and 11%. And at the time we shared that, we laid out many of the factors that we saw giving 3M the ability to grow earnings per share 9% to 11% over this time frame. Several of those factors are performing, what, at the level we expected or better. Those include our organic revenue growth, our operating income margins, our tax rate and our share repurchases. Those items are offsetting what we're seeing of headwinds from a stronger U.S. dollar and pension expense tailwinds that are not quite as strong as what we had anticipated. For this metric as well, we see ourselves on track to the 9% to 11% earnings per share growth over the 5-year time horizon.\r\nThe third metric we shared was free cash flow conversion. 3M, over time, has been a company that can generate strong and consistent cash flow. Part of the reason we've put this metric forward is we saw the opportunity to move us to approximately 100% free cash flow conversion, driven by even more efficient use of our capital and by improving our working capital turns. With those factors, we see ourselves on track to achieving 100% free cash flow conversion over the 5-year time horizon as well.\r\nAnd then finally, return on invested capital. You've heard interest first through this morning 3M's 4 fundamental strengths: technology, manufacturing, global capability and our brand. Those strengths we see as primary drivers of 3M's ability to consistently drive and deliver returns on invested capital of approximately 20%. In addition, what we are doing by minimizing our cash balances and improving our asset efficiency, that's enhancing our ability to keep our return on invested capital in the range that we said. Over the 5-year time horizon, we continue to expect 3M to be able to deliver return on invested capital of approximately 20%.\r\nSo I'll close out the prepared portion for this morning by just showing the headlines that Inge started the morning with. 3M's having a strong 2014, and we're anticipating a delivery of a strong 2015. We have the 3M team that's executing well. And on a personal note, I've had the opportunity to meet many of you, enjoyed that interaction, and I'm looking forward to that continued interaction over the coming year.\r\nWith that, I'll -- I'd like you to give us about 2 minutes to get the chairs aligned for us to go now into the Q&A session.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Matt Ginter (Executives)】\nGood morning, everyone. I'm Matt Ginter, Vice President of Investor Relations for 3M Company. Welcome to our 2015 Outlook Meeting. I'd like to also welcome all investors and analysts that are listening via webcast today.\r\nWe've got a good lineup of speakers today. Of course, you'll hear from our Chairman, President and CEO, Inge Thulin; and from our CFO and Senior Vice President, Nick Gangestad. Also presenting today are Frank Little, and Frank heads up our Safety and Graphics business; Mike Roman who runs our Industrial business; and H.C. Shin who leads 3M's international operations. These are 3 very large parts of our business, representing the majority of our sales, and I think you'll walk away with a better understanding of them.\r\nI'd like to mention just a few upcoming events. First, our 2015 earnings calls will be on January 27, April 23, July 23 and October 22. And second, please mark your calendars for next December 15 when we plan to host our 2016 Outlook Meeting. For now, plan on 8:00 to noon that day, and we'll communicate more details as they develop.\r\nPlease take a moment to read the forward-looking statement. During today's conference call, we'll make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.\r\nSo very quickly, here's today's agenda. Inge will open up, followed by Nick, by Frank, Mike -- or excuse me, by Frank, Mike and H.C., and then Nick will finish the day. We'll have Q&A at the end with all speakers on stage. And the meeting will adjourn no later than 11:00 a.m. So once again, thanks for participating. And I would like to introduce 3M's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Inge Thulin.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Inge Thulin (Executives)】\nThank you, Matt, and good morning to all of you. It's a pleasure to have you here at 3M's 2015 Outlook Meeting in New York. And it's a pleasure for me to be here today with Frank, with Nick, H.C., Mike and Matt Ginter in order to explain our business.\r\nSo what I would like to start with is, first of all, to lay out the agenda for my portion here. I will start by giving you the headlines of the day. I will again talk about our playbook that is in place and now working and operationalizing, talk about our '13 to '17 5-year plan update, and then talk about the 3 key levers that is driving and extending the value of the corporation, and you will hear from each presenter today how we are utilizing them in the corporation.\r\nSo first of all, relative to the headlines of the day. We are on track to deliver our 2013 to '17 financial objectives, as laid out in our Investor Meeting in St. Paul, November 8, 2012. We are creating additional and substantial shareholder value through the 3 key levers: Portfolio management, investing in innovation and business transformation, and we will talk about all of them today. We are delivering strong organic sales growth, and you will see in some information from Nick in the end of the evidence around that versus when we started the journey. Our productivity is improving margins, not only in 2014, but also some margin expansion in 2015.\r\nAnd this morning, we announced an increase for 2015 in the per share dividend by 20%, which is coming on top of a 35% increase in 2014. And then we are executing on the capital structure strategy that we announced last year. So no change yet from that perspective, and I'm here to tell you that the plan is working and we feel very good, and I have very high confidence in the execution of the plan.\r\nSo let me start by just to give a couple of comments relative to the way we execute the playbook in order to create more value for shareholders. We laid out a very clear vision in the beginning of 2012. We complement that with the 6 strategies. We also took a hard look at the business conduct and simplified that as that is, in fact, priority #1 for us, to protect the corporation in everything we do. And then we have also laid out some new 3M leadership behaviors, which is important for the leaders in the company in order to execute the plan. That's augmented by portfolio management, invest in innovation and business transformation, that is then the key driver and lever for us as we move ahead. So very important thing when we look upon it.\r\nThe important thing where we crystallized the vision was to make sure that everyone, both internally and externally, knew and understood the purpose about 3M. And when you look upon it, it's very holistic and it's a vision that is right down to the heart of 3M. We talk about advancing, enhancing and improving, and that is what we do at 3M everyday. Everyday, we wake up today and what we have done for the last 112 years is to ask ourself, how can we advance and enhance and improve.\r\nWhen you think about our portfolio from a product perspective and you think about the geographical area, that's a vision as a stretch. We can do that for every company, every home and for every life around the world. And it's very clear for most of us what company and home stand for. For life, for us, is both schools, hospitals and it's also sustainability and community. And the way we do it, which is coming back to what 3M is all about relative to the research and development be the heartbeat of the company, is through technologies, products and innovation. So this was an important statement and that, by definition, is what is driving the company and the decision we are making relative to the long-term vision.\r\nWe complemented that with 6 strategies, which has sort of enabled those for us in order to obtain the vision at the point. They are interdependent. They're very well-crafted relative to the wording, so everyone knows what needs to be done. And they are, today, after almost 3 years in the company, totally operationalized into the operation.  The 4 first of them are around growth, the fifth one is around our people and the last one is around operational excellence.\r\nThe first one start with a very important statement that was laid out at the time, which is relevance to our customers, and I will show in a second what we have done in order to improve the relevance to our customers. So it was not only wording in the strategy, we are also taking action. We were very clear on that.\r\nThe third strategy is the only strategy that start with a statement: Invest in innovation. And as you know, we have ramped up from closer to -- we have been around 5.5% in the past, currently coming closer to 6% in the 5-year plan. So this was an important starting point for us as we start to roll out the plan.\r\nAnd on November 8, 2012, we also declared for you our objectives in terms of our 5-year plan as we go forward, which was earnings per growth of 9% to 11%, organic revenue growth of 4% to 6%, return on invested capital around 20% and free cash flow conversion around 100%. And as I started the meeting, I'm pleased to tell you we're on the road in order to meet those objectives as we go ahead.\r\nNow this is how we organize. And here, you can see a couple of elements on this slide. First of all, you can see that we have very solid performance across all of our business groups. And the 2 figures you will see is the -- the growth figure is the plan we laid out from '13 to '17, and operating income figure you see is year-to-date Q3. So you can see the plan for the company over the 5 years is 4% to 6%, with slight difference in between the 5 businesses, but you can also see the operating income for every single business is above 20%. In fact, we have one which is Health Care, even above 30%. So average of the company of the 3 quarters this year is 23%, with all businesses above 20%. So a very solid, good performance in all business groups.\r\nNow this is an important element because the question is, of course, how is that possible to have these premium margins year-after-year, and in fact, also show some margin expansion. Well, here is the 4 fundamental strengths of 3M. And it's an important slide because this is illustrating our vertical and horizontal business model, and that is what is driving the value of the company. So they are around technology, manufacturing, global capabilities and brands.\r\nSo let me make some comments on technology. So this is the ability for us to share and combine elements in the technology platforms that produce unique, differentiated products that is translating to premium margins. Very important, and I will talk more about that when I talk about technologies later on.\r\nIf you look upon manufacturing, that is where we can use technologies to include processes, that's our trade secrets, that will take us to production capabilities that will produce superior products to a very low cost, again, able to utilize capacity and capabilities all over the world. Everyone in the company can use it in terms of the assets that are there.\r\nGlobal capabilities, this is our subsidiary structure all over the world. And as you saw earlier this year that we also purchased the last 25% of our Japanese operation of Sumitomo. This is where we can commercialize and adapt commercialization on a local base. And in every case, we are the first entry into a market. We don't enter into a distributor. We enter into the 3M subsidiary, meaning, we decide the priorities in that country.\r\nAnd then finally, our brand equity, which is a strategic brand, but also then complemented with many power brands in the organization. But by definition, the brand is what you're standing up for 3M, enabled for every business to utilize.\r\nSo those are the fundamental strengths and the foundation for the performance relative to what we have done for many, many years and will continue to do. And you will hear more about it, how that is impacting the different business groups that are presenting this morning.\r\nNow we have talked earlier, and I would like to just lay it out again that one of the strengths with 3M, as we are so global our nature, is the way we can capitalize on the evolution of an economy. And we all know that the evolution of an economy is basically, the first step is infrastructure. When infrastructure is in place, manufacturing are moving in, in a much bigger scale in terms of -- \r\n[Audio Gap] \r\nmanufacturing up and going, work is created in the countries, people start to spend money, and that is when retail start to accelerate.\r\nAnd the final step is around health care for a country. So of course, there's been health care provided before, but is moving to a new level as you're coming to that step in the evolution. This is for every country around the world. It was in the United States when this was developed. It was in Sweden when that was developed. And it's in many of the developing economies today.\r\nFor us, when you look upon our portfolio, we are evaluating opportunities in every stage of that evolution of a country. So if it's early on, we are either in with traffic safety system or our communication business. When you go to manufacturing, that is where we have 1/3 of our revenue in the company, big business that Mike Roman will talk about later today. Safety is coming very much into regulation and fall protection, et cetera. And of course, into retail, that is where we start to capitalize on our consumer group, with all the brands in terms of Post-it, Scotch, Filtrete, Command, et cetera. And then finally, health care, that is coming in the end with more sophisticated solution. This is a proven model for success for 3M. We have done it for many years. And also, if you go back to the other slide and look upon the margin differentiation in between the businesses, this is a model that is working very well for us not only in terms of growth, but also in terms of maintaining and improving margin as we move ahead.\r\nAnd when we go back to the evolution of the mix for us in between developed and developing economies, back in 2003, you can see here that developing stand -- stood for 21% of our mix; and developed, 79%. We stand today at 35%-65%. And moving forward, it look like it will be in the range of 60%-40%, with a growth rate in the developed world of 2% to 4% and probably 7% to 10% in the developing world. So still a good evolution. And for us, even if landscape from time to time, as we know, change in between developed and developing economy, the important thing is to stick to your long-term plan, but adjust for short-term interruptions in the economy.\r\nSo let me then talk about the 3 key levers because they are important for us in order to create even more value as we move ahead. And we have done quite a bit the last almost 3 years now, and I would like to give you an update on what we did and where we're going for the future.\r\nSo this is, first of all, relative to portfolio. This is not a program. This is, as all of you know, this a process that you constantly work on, and it's important for us to continue to deploy opportunities across the corporation. And we need to reallocate resources versus the best opportunities. And it's also a good way for us to augment this with organic growth through merger and acquisition playbook that I will talk about in a second.\r\nSo first of all, here is what we have been doing, and this is an important slide because a lot of work went into, what I would call, put 3M in order for making sure we are very well prepared for the future.\r\nSo first of all, as you recall, back in 2011 and before, we had 6 big sectors as a company. We went to 5 business groups. And it was all based on relevance to customers, be easier to do business with and link our capabilities to the markets, be able to react faster to demand from the customers through their demand and our technology platforms, our ability to utilize assets better in the company. So it's a big thing when you go from 6 to 5 on the first layer on the organization.\r\nBelow that, we had, what we call at the time, divisions, but think about them like 40 divisions or 40 businesses. We have reduced that to 27 businesses. This is a remarkable move, an important move again in order for us to create scale and customer relevance, to reduce costs through efficiency and productivity in the processes, be able to reallocate resources to better opportunity and accelerate prioritization relative to research and development investment. And you can see here, combining the businesses was very important in many cases in order for us to get the scale in some businesses we have participated in many, many years.\r\nSo when I look upon this, for me and the team, it's an important element to say we are very well prepared for the future, and we have been able to both build out relevance for customer and reduce cost and drive productivity in processes. And the way we have done it is, in some cases, consolidating businesses that we, by definition, in my view, had built not so much on the reality relative for the customer was looking for and what was happening maybe in some consolidation in the marketplace. We were able to allocate resources for bigger opportunities in the company. And as you know, everyone cannot win. You have to make choices, and that is what we have been doing the last couple of years.\r\nAnd then we have also looked upon acquisition and divestiture based on the portfolio, where you have seen some bigger acquisitions like Ceradyne, and in fact, also, the 3M Sumitomo Electric deal we did. But you've also seen some smaller businesses that we have diversed in the company as we moved for the last couple of years. So I think those 3 elements have been very important for us as we looked into the portfolio.\r\nNow you'll recall, we laid out the map in terms of Heartland, Push Forward, and of course, we have something in Strategic Review. And I would like today to just make sure that you understand and know that we are much stronger today in our portfolio than when we started. And there, when you look upon the Heartland and the Push Forward, this is all about protect and improve, and invest for growth. This is an important element of our business, and I will give some comments on both categories here in a second.\r\nSo first of all, the Heartland division. They are -- stand for around 1/3 of the company in sales revenue, and in fact, are accretive to the margins, so very important. It's 5 divisions in the company, and they are large and they are participating in large market with solid growth. They have a very strong global penetration, and they have leading brand positions in their market segments. They are also fundamental in terms of technologies as they are using multiple 3M technologies in the businesses. We look upon this to go from -- back in '12 from $10.5 billion, closer to $13 billion, so around 4.5% to 5% organic local currency growth in the plan. Very, very important piece of our business.\r\nThe Push Forward, the categorization is very similar to the Heartland, but with the difference that they are actually participating in even higher-growth market space. We have very global relevant product portfolio there, and we have category-defining brands. But we are relatively smaller in those segments, meaning, big opportunities. And specifically, I will say, in international, outside of the United States, has also very strong technology foundation and have a high return on investment, meaning, investment here for growth is a very good thing for us. And you can see the growth in this category is 5% to 5.5% in the plan. And we estimate this, where we started from 2012 of $11 billion, to be closer to $14 billion to $15 billion by 2017. So a very, very important part of the business and get a lot of additional investment as we move ahead.\r\nNow we can complement that with mergers and acquisition. And we have complemented not only what's the thinking, but also a playbook relative to this.\r\nSo first of all, relative to the portfolio intent. We would like to bolster the technology position and pursue adjacencies in the Heartland divisions, very important element for us as we move ahead. We would like to build scale and facilitate market penetration for the Push Forward. That is our thinking relative to where we will look for the future. We will build upon that leverage of the 3M fundamental strengths around technology, manufacturing, global footprint and brand. Meaning, if those fundamentals not can drive additional value fast for us, we should probably go away and do something else. It doesn't mean that all 4 of them need to and can add value, but at least 2.5 to 3 should add value. So it's an important element in the playbook.\r\nAnd then when we look upon the markets. The end-market growth should be sustainable and accretive. And of course, we should lever the integration capability to generate value over time in order to maximize value. So when I look upon the work that have been done the last couple of years and the portfolio work and identification of the fundamentals, I feel much better in terms of the playbook, where to look and what to do, and also where not to look and what not to do as we move ahead. So very important element. And it took us some time to come to this point, but the most important metric is not time, it's to get it right and create value for all of you shareholders. So that's the first lever.\r\nLet's then talk about innovation. This is an important element for us, and as I said in the third strategy, start with investing in innovation. This is for us to enhance commercialization effectiveness through customer insight. We need to have good customer insight in order for us to utilize our 46 technology platforms. We will increase R&D investment, but also improve productivity on what we are doing. So this an important element of increased R&D and productivity. And we are going more versus platform development versus single-product solutions. And that's not only us, it's in fact, our customers that are demanding that, and we are responding very well to that.\r\nNow the unique thing with 3M is we have 46 technology platform that are owned by the company, and everyone in the company can use it. They are not owned by 1 division or 1 subsidiary that own the technology platform. This is owned by the enterprise, and everyone can use it in order to combine elements that will provide a solution. And that's an important element of our model, very, very important. So it's unique for us, and it's working very well and have done so for many years. And I will even say, when people talk about open innovation, in a way, 3M have used open innovation internally for many years. But it's also open innovation with our customers because we work with our customers around combining elements here for their success.\r\nNow there's 2 processes in order to make sure we get out what we need. And you look upon the left-hand side, it's a process we call customer-inspired innovation. It's very much around businesses that are designed and spec-in, big key account management and is a customer-specific process. You work with one specific customer around their platform that we provide solution for them.\r\nOn the right-hand side, we have a process called Insights 2 Innovation, or as we call it, i2i. That's very much like consumer insight. It's around everything we do in consumables. And that is around markets. It's not customer-specific, it's around a broad-based market. Those are the only 2 processes used in the company, and that is where it start. It doesn't start with the technology platforms. It starts with customers and markets, rolling back, find solution and then execute that. So very, very important to understand that there is a very robust process in the company in order for us to find the big solutions.\r\nNow as I said earlier, we have made a step change relative to investment in research and development because we are a company that not would like to be commoditized. We are a company that will provide world-class solutions, and that will also make the game of additional investment in research and development.\r\nAnd you can see here, the way we look upon it, when we go from 5.5%, closer to 6%, we will like to do that in disruptive markets and technologies. It's important element because that is also where the company then are spending additional money to make sure product that take longer time, little bit more risky, that we invest in that from the company side as we move ahead.\r\nAnd then when you look upon extending the core platform and expanding into new markets, we continue to do that, and we are very well suited in order to accelerate as we move ahead. And here, we have a couple of example on extending the core platforms around ceramics, that came direct out from the Ceradyne acquisition. And you can, in fact, also see expanding into new markets, that you have also an advanced ceramic for oil and gas that came as base off the Ceradyne acquisition. You see activities in bonding. That is a big element for us, not only for the Industrial business, but also from Electronic and Energy, working with big global customers in the consumer electronics space.\r\nAnd abrasives, that is a incredible platform for us from a technology perspective. But more than that, we have 3 arms to go to market for abrasives. We have automotive aftermarket that go to body shops; we have main industrial, we call abrasive division; and then we have a division called Do-it-yourself. So with the technology around abrasives, we can also go to market with 3 different divisions that are then entering into different channels.\r\nAnd then you see here, powered and supplied air respirators that Frank will talk a little bit more about, that is related into one of our Heartland divisions and doing very well in a big space, as you know.\r\nExpanding into new markets, I talked about advanced ceramics, but we also have here filtration for biopharma that is going into the life sciences sector in filtration. Very, very interesting for us and a business that is doing better and better for us after the acquisition we did many, many years ago. And then filtration of air quality, that you will hear H.C. Shin specifically talk about, which is a big thing in many countries around the world. And think about that not only as air pollution, but to think about also clean water and think about like food safety as big trends going around the world. So very good things going on here.\r\nNow in terms of disrupting markets, we started 2 years ago to accelerate our investment from 5.5%, closer to 6%. We took aside money in the company and we type of invest for divisions that is coming forward with good proposals in terms of disruptive technologies. And up to today, we have approved 30 programs. We approved 19 in 2013, we approved 7 in 2014 and we have already approved 4 going into 2015; 7 of them have a very early-stage commercialization in place. And we estimate that this year, the sales will be around $100 million to $125 million. As you know, this is early stage. And we believe, going into next year, there is maybe 8 other programs that could be in early stage of commercialization. So a very good process. And you see -- and progress. And you see here a couple of them we have highlighted in terms of air barriers, surface modification and analytics. All of them coming out from additional investment in the center of the company for these disruptive technologies so we can disrupt some markets.\r\nNow the third key lever here is around business transformation, and let me give you some comments on that today. This will make sure that we are becoming more agile, more competitive, and most importantly, more relevant to our customers. Ultimately, their business transformation will provide the system and processes for us to drive productivity through our supply chain, to reduce inventory and tax rates, and above all, deliver quicker and greater value to our customers. This is the whole idea, efficiency, productivity, very important for us to be agile, to be able to provide better service to our customer. The backbone of that is a global ERP system, and I would like to give you an update today on that rollout plan.\r\nSo a priority over the last past years of the ERP's implementation has been to learning our new system, to enhance its functionality. As a result, our confidence continues to grow relative to the success. And we have now successfully executed in 5 countries around the world. \r\nWe have also successfully deployed for our Center of Excellence a distribution center in Switzerland and our 4 primary distribution center in West Europe. That's Bedford in the U.K, it's Dabrowa in Poland, it's Essuet [ph] in France and Jüchen in Germany, which is actually an absolute best -- biggest distribution center in West Europe.\r\nIn each deployment in the 5 countries and the 4 distribution center and the Center of Excellence, we have, of course, learned. And one thing we have learned is that we are better served by deployment as we go ahead to do it region by region. So we have started a regional approach, and our focus today is to accelerate and completing the deployment in West Europe, and that will be during the next 2 years. United States will prepare in the meantime and will follow immediately after West Europe.\r\nThe cost for the program for the company will be $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, so up from $800 million, as was previously communicated. However, we believe that the total value will increase as well. And with full implementation, we are now looking for upwards of $700 million in annual operating income improvement and $0.5 billion of structural working capital improvements by 2020. So going very well. We are learning in every execution and deployment. And I personally have gone to all cases where we have implemented it in order to make sure that I myself get the first-hand learning and challenge the team before we move ahead. And the important thing here is actually not -- the metric here is not time, the metric here is customers. So we will never jeopardize any service to customers as we execute this.\r\nNow coming back to the 5 business groups. And today, you will hear from Industrial Business Group by Mike Roman, and you will hear from Frank Little from Safety and Graphics, and then you will also hear about international from H.C. Shin. I will give a couple of comments on the 3 other business groups that are not represented here this morning.\r\nSo first of all, our Health Care business, and as you know, that's a big portion of our business, in fact, the fastest-growing business for us and the highest margins, so by definition, a very nice space. We have done this business for many, many years in 3M. And it's a combination of both, I would say, the medical consumables, to oral care, to drug delivery and to food safety, with health information system around analytics to actually go broad-based of all markets. They, as everyone else, are able to use the technologies in the company, of all the 46 platforms, to find solution, if that is in vascular access, skin integrity or if it's in health care analytics or infection drug delivery system. So very, very good business and very pleased, of course, with the performance from them.\r\nThe evolution of the business, you can see here, go back to 2012, this was then slightly over $5 billion, $5.1 billion, now is $5.6 billion. So very good consistent growth. And you see, as I said earlier, a business with very solid and sustainable margins, with 30% plus. When you look upon the mix, you can see that we are very strong in the developed part, with United States of 44% and Europe/Middle East/Africa of 30%.\r\nComing back to the breach of evolution of economies is much more for us to go in the developing economies as we move ahead. And the solution that we are providing here is very attractive as your health care system are evolving and becoming more sophisticated, as proof of our strong position in the developed world. So very good business, we are very pleased with it and constantly delivering and growing.\r\nNext one is our Electronics and Energy market where we have done some significant improvements during the last 2 years, both in terms of consolidation of divisions, optimizing the footprint internally in the company and becoming more relevant to our customers.\r\nAnd you can see here, this is today 5 division, down from almost 8, I think, when we started. This was a very important element for us, specifically electronics market, which is a very fast-growing market and requiring responsiveness from any supplier with speed. This is a good business for us because it's all technology-driven. We know how to do that. It is soon as you're expecting on a platform, next step is coming crossed out. We know how to do that. So this is a very, very good business for us. And both the electronic market, in the way we define it with our products, which is a $48 billion market; and the energy market, that the way we define it, is a $45 billion market, is very, very attractive for us.\r\nAnd when you look upon the performance here, you can see we about turned the curve in terms of growth back from 2012 and before. And in fact, also, we have improved margins quite a bit. And this is a realization of this matter. But you can see, it's running basically at around 20%. And as we have said in our guidance, we believe that this year, they will be in the high teens in terms of operating income, and I think that's where we will end up in there. But this is a big, big turnaround from the business.\r\nYou can also see here then, due to the electronic piece, that APAC is, of course, geographically a big piece of this business. But don't make the mistake of saying all the specs in or many of the specs in need to be done out of places around the world. So that's where the production is happening. They're personally very pleased with this business and the evolution that we have done during the last almost 3 years now in terms of making sure that this is a solid good business for us as we move ahead.\r\nAnd then finally, our Consumer Business Group that is the business that, for many people, we are most known for due to the brands around Post-it and Scotch. But this is a very good business for us in terms of what we can do to haul away from consumers, making sure that we understand where the shoppers are going for the future because they would go different places and then link that into the channel partners as we move ahead. Our brands here around Scotch-Brite, Command, ScotchBlue, Scotch, Post-it, ACE, Futuro, Nexcare, Filtrete, Scotchgard and Thinsulate are very well-known brand and are, in all cases, category leaders in those channels. Very good plan for us in this business. And again, as you look upon the performance here, it's a business that are growing maybe on the low end to the rest of the businesses for us, on the other hand, very good margins.\r\nAgain, going back to the roadmap of evolution of economies. When you look upon this, with U.S. standing for 56% of the mix, this business will accelerate in international as that business -- those countries evolve in their economies. So feel very good about this business as well and very pleased with Mike Vale and his team relative to the evolution there.\r\nYou can see here that one big piece of the market here is Do-it-yourself and is accelerating. Our Do-it-yourself business, which is around Filtrete, is growing very fast and is one of the Push Forward businesses in the corporation. And again, much, much bigger and much stronger in the United States than outside of the United States. We have some incredible upside here as we move ahead. In that business, you should think about Filtrete, Command and Blue Scotch as the main products. And I think we are 10% plus in growth as we go and very profitable.\r\nSo by that, I hope you have got a better understanding this morning relative to our playbook that all started with a vision and our strategies that are now operationalized in the company, I would say, broad-based and very deep in each business, commitment to business conduct, and we don't take that lightly, I can tell you that. And then our leadership behaviors that we revamped in the beginning of this year and moved from something we call earlier around 3M leadership attributes. And we also believe that behaviors will drive us in a different way as leaders versus attributes. And then as I talked about, the 3 key levers, and you will hear about the 3 of them from the presentations here shortly of how they are utilizing in their businesses and in international.\r\nSo I end then just by telling you that -- here to inform you that we are on a good track. The 3M machine is working. And what we laid out on the 8th of November of 2012 relative to our being active in the plan, we are on track to meet that.\r\nSo by that, I thank you. And then I have the pleasure to introduce Frank Little, that is our Executive Vice President for Safety and Graphic business. So thank you very much.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Frank Little (Executives)】\nThank you, Inge, for that excellent overview of the company. It's my pleasure to join you this morning and talk about our Safety and Graphics business group.\r\nFirst, I think it's important to understand that Safety and Graphics is very well-positioned to bring the vision that Inge explained to you to life for the company. We participate in every element of that vision.\r\nLet me share the components of our business group with you.  We're a dynamic set of great 3M businesses. First, at $2.4 billion in sales, is our personal safety business, an industry-leading personal protective equipment player. Next, at $1.5 billion in sales, is our traffic safety and security business, a market leader in reflective sheeting and public security solutions. At $1.5 billion in sales, our commercial solutions business is a leader in graphic films and commercial cleaning solutions. And finally, at $0.3 billion in sales, is our industrial mineral products business, a provider of granules used in the roofing shingles market.\r\nNot only do we have a strong set of businesses, but we're also growing and highly profitable. We have built solid organic local currency growth of 4%, while increasing margins to be accretive to 3M. Our portfolio is well-balanced among our businesses, with size and scale on each business area. And we're also reasonably well balanced geographically, with almost 2/3 of our business outside the U.S., with size and scale in each region. Because of this, we are well positioned to grow in both developed and developing economies.\r\nWe not only have the power of the 3M brand, but also several well-known sub-brands and trademarks, which have real meaning to our customers. The 3M brand is a leader in workplace safety. With over 40 years of leadership in the industry, a majority of professionals have a high degree of familiarity with our brand, as well as choose us as a leading brand. We also have strong preferred sub-brands, such as Peltor in hearing communications; and Speedglas in welding protection. Similarly, the 3M brand is also strong in traffic safety, with over 75 years of leadership in this industry. Here, our Diamond Grade trademark sheeting leads the industry in performance. 3M is also well-known with the commercial cleaning space, with our Scotch-Brite and Scotchgard sub-brands have been trusted for over 50 years to solve the toughest cleaning and protection challenges.\r\nWe are also fortunate that our safety businesses are well-positioned to capitalize on the sizable growing safety regulation trend around the emerging world. This map depicts the state of safety regulations and enforcement in the world today. Green represents strong regulations and enforcement, with many of which 3M was widely involved in consultative manner in establishing. Dark gray is where standards and regulations are developing and enforcement is accelerating. And light gray is where regulations and enforcement are embryonic and beginning to gain awareness.\r\nOver -- mining accidents, for example, result in over 33 deaths each day. Falls account for 37% of the deaths in U.S. construction. And there are over 1 million traffic-related deaths, with 92% of those happening in developing countries. As these areas develop, we see huge potential for growth by working with our customers to develop products that help prevent these tragedies.\r\nOur workplace safety and traffic safety businesses are industry-leading consultants with regulatory agencies and industry customers. Teams work worldwide to develop and ensure compliance with the appropriate safety standards, and we'll be well-positioned to benefit from the macro trends of adoption to higher standards in regulation. We continue to invest in our significant global expertise and resources supporting this trend as we work to make the world a safer place.\r\nNow as with 3M overall, we are focused on using the 3 key levers that Inge spoke about of portfolio management, investing in innovation and business transformation, to drive continual improvement in our business. Let me start by describing how we are accomplishing effective portfolio management by focusing on 4 key markets, increasing customer relevance within those markets and prioritizing for profitable growth.\r\nWe have carefully chosen these 4 key markets from which to focus our customer engagement. In safety, we are advancing worker's safety, security and productivity, addressing a $33 billion market opportunity. Among market segments which span most industries, we are focusing on growth in the chemicals and pharma, general manufacturing, construction, engineering and utilities, and transportation safety.\r\nOur next market in commercial solutions is where we enhance our customers' delivery of their brand experience in a $42 billion market opportunity. We are aligning around hospitality, retail stores, construction, food service and transportation fleet management segments within this area.\r\nWe are also helping government customers improve traffic safety and public security, a $20 billion market opportunity. We're focusing our capability on traffic safety, public security, intelligent transportation systems and transportation infrastructure segments. \r\nAnd then finally, our fourth market area is mining, oil and gas, where we are early in consolidating small market-focused activities from across the company as we work to bring solutions from 3M to our customers. Our market opportunity is over $28 billion in this area across all segments of the production process.\r\nNow in addition to refining the scope of our market focus, we've also done much work to prioritize our business portfolio. We've moved from 9 businesses to 5 by rationalizing, combining and integrating to become more capable and efficient. We started with the creation of our market-focused Mining, Oil and Gas organization, enabling us to bring one face of support and all of 3M's technologies to customers in these industries. We combined our Track and Trace, Security Systems and Traffic Safety businesses to enable us to bring a more comprehensive suite of solutions to our customers in the government markets. And this year, we also combined our Commercial Graphics, Building and Commercial Services, and Architectural Markets divisions to help us play bigger with a more relevant set of solutions to enhance the brand experience for our customers. All of these actions have helped us build scale, add customer relevance and become more competitive.\r\nThe foundation for our Safety and Graphics business group is the personal safety business. It is a Heartland business that Inge spoke of earlier. We've been on a transformative journey, leveraging our fundamental strengths within 3M, along with specific acquisitions to move from a respiratory protection leader to a personal protective equipment leader. As we've done this, we've built a global network of 7-platform development labs. We have integrated and invested to create a global supply chain, where more than 65% of our products are supplied from within the region of purchase. We've dramatically grown our global business so that over 75% of our sales comes from our international operations. And we've built the equity of 3M's brand and safety industry over 40 years to become the most-trusted brand globally. All of this has allowed us to strengthen our portfolio within this business to deliver on our commitment of customer-relevant breadth with industry-leading depth.\r\nNow our combination of 3 businesses into the traffic, safety and security business allowed us to leverage 3M's fundamental strengths to bring more attractive solutions to our government customers across the traffic, safety and security market segments. We can now leverage one innovation pipeline, leveraging prioritization to drive larger scale programs. We have built hardgoods and software scale in this business, we have world-class project management and a global network of government relations teams to help us build customer engagement around the world. As a result, we now have significant critical mass and capability from which to build our customer relevance.\r\nSimilarly, our combination of 3 businesses into the commercial solutions business allowed us to leverage 3M's fundamental strengths to bring more attractive solutions to our commercial customers. We can now leverage a single innovation pipeline, driving technology and programs of greater scale and impact. We now have local teams and greater scale to deliver novel growth programs, such as our brand owner experiences offering; a better global supply chain capability and capital equipment leverage; and a broader set of solutions to help our customers deliver their brand experience. As a result, we now have stronger programs and more capability from which to build our customer relevance in the most attractive market segments.\r\nNow let me transition to share more about our second lever for improving our business: Investing in innovation. Here, our efforts are focused on extending and leveraging our core platforms, accelerating game-changing innovation and expanding our global knowledge centers.\r\nWithin Safety and Graphics business group, we have 3 major technology clusters which are deployed across our businesses. We show some examples on this page. For example, our non-woven technology enables superior filtration capabilities in respirators and fluid filtration, as well as controlled scouring capability in cleaning pads. Our tapes and films technology enables better performance in our Scotchlite trademark reflective tapes for garments, spectral reflective graphic films and our Diamond Grade reflective sign sheeting. And finally, our systems and hardgoods expertise is powering the development of advanced active safety solutions, license plate recognition systems and biometrics tracking systems.\r\nNow we are also introducing game-changing innovation and new products across our portfolio. Within the personal safety business, for example, the newly launched Versaflo powered and supplied air system addresses a growing number of extremely hazardous environments requiring respiratory protection. Applications such as mining, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, refining, and of course, health care with such recent threats like Ebola, are all driving significant growth within a $4 billion category.\r\nAnother example is our fall protection rescue systems. This is a unique solution to the need for self-rescue of workers who have suffered an arrested fall in remote locations. Typical for 3M, we are bringing new innovation to expand our penetration into this highly profitable and strong product growth category. With this type of innovation, we are addressing a $1.5 billion product category.\r\nWithin government markets, I'd like to introduce a few other examples of game-changing innovation. We're introducing a new generation of reflective sheeting technology, utilizing a proprietary new manufacturing construction for a large part of our product range. This technology offers increased brightness, along with embedded security features, as well as increased throughput when using digital printing for our sheeting converters. Once again, we are raising the game in our approach to reflective sheeting materials, driving accelerated growth in a $1.6 billion category.\r\nAnother example is our new multimodal biometrics platform, which addresses a trend in biometric security space that really is getting after allowing multiple modes of assessment and validation. This new-generation system provides a step-change improvement in our facial recognition capabilities and integrates the ability to address the fingerprint, iris and facial recognition assessment in one system, without sacrificing our capabilities for accuracy and speed. This program addresses a fast-growing $4 billion category.\r\nWithin our commercial solutions business, we have a strong complement of technology focused on creating and maintaining surfaces in many challenging applications. As a leader in graphic film for brand owners, we are continuously introducing relevant new products to the market. Our Envision films feature sustainable non-PVC film structures that expand the technology to a broad array of printing processes. These products have revolutionary high performance and workability, increasing labor productivity with both traditional and nontraditional surfaces. By raising the bar once again, we will strengthen our leadership in this $2 billion category.\r\nNow the groundbreaking innovation is with our new sustainable family of clean and protect products. These products use advanced materials and nanotechnology to clean, while simultaneously creating a protective layer across various surface cleaning and treatment applications. This layer allows our customers to use less chemicals and less effort in the maintenance of the surface, with some customers experience a reduction of 30% to 50% in the time it takes to clean. Already introduced for glass and for stone floors, we will extend this technology to other challenging surface. With this suite of products, we can address a broader opportunity in this $5 billion product category.\r\nAnd then finally, as we work to bring 3M technology to our customers in the mining and oil and gas markets, I'd like to highlight a couple of game-changing innovation programs here. First, we're bringing game-changing innovation in the area of active safety. Our customers need a better way of ensuring employees are properly protected and productive on the job. Our active safety platform represents a new revolutionary approach to assessing and monitoring personnel protective equipment usage, fit, maintenance and standards compliance in demanding applications. The platform is cloud-enabled and is currently in beta testing with a major mining company. We see this as an important emerging need and macro trend in many industries, and we expect to address a $200 million emerging growth opportunity here.\r\nAnother example of game-changing innovation is our new approach to the sand screen filtering and produce water management in deep downhole well applications. This utilizes ceramics technology from the Ceradyne acquisition, another example of cross-technology leverage, like Inge pointed out before, across all of our businesses, which addresses a critical need for more durable and higher-capacity sand filtration systems, replacing the current metals technology, which is subject to accelerated wear- and fatigue-based failures. This technology enables longer uptime, better capacity in deeper well depth operation, allowing us to address $100 million growth opportunity.\r\nNow let me transition to the third lever that we're using to drive value across our business in business transformation. Within this, we are using our approach to drive operational excellence, improve our business processes and building our capability across the globe. Business transformation is enabling Safety and Graphics to increase operational excellence. This approach enables a lower cost-to-serve model through the integration of business services, improved responsiveness and service for customers as we adopt best practices across the global organization, accelerated time to launch for new global products as our data transparency increases, and gives us better quality and more responsive decision-making as we gain insight from more consistent data inputs. All this allows us to speed development of critical capabilities and allows us to implement a stronger customer insights and customer-relevant innovation model in our business. We continue to use collective business transformation activities to improve the competitiveness of the Safety and Graphics business group.\r\nSo utilizing the strong 3M brand and sub-brands, capturing the clear market opportunity for safety and utilizing the 3 key levers for improving our competitiveness, we are continuing on our transformational journey of: Integrating and consolidating our business to bring more customer relevance, investing in game-changing innovation in our focus markets, driving operational excellence and building business capability around the world and becoming an even stronger, more accretive growth engine for 3M.\r\nSo in conclusion, Safety and Graphics is well-positioned to deliver all the elements of 3M's vision to our customers, whether it is technology advancing every company via secure ID credentials and verification systems, or personal protective equipment safeguarding workers; 3M products enhancing every home via cleaning products and surface materials and treatments; 3M innovation, improving every life via respirators that help protect people from harmful pollution, and reflective sheeting signage that protects people on the roads, our range of capabilities truly brings the complete 3M vision to life. \r\nThank you for your support for 3M. And now, let me introduce Mike Roman who will discuss our Industrial Business Group.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Michael Roman (Executives)】\nAll right. Thanks, Frank. Good morning. It is my pleasure to present the 3M Industrial business. We are a business group that has delivered strong performance over the past 3 years, and again, in 2014.  The strong performance comes from what we do everyday to bring the 3M vision of advancing every company, enhancing every home and improving every life to life in 3M industrial markets.  Let's start with an overview of our Industrial Business Group. \r\nWe're an $11 billion business growing at 1.5x IPI in a $90-plus billion marketplace. We have a proven ability to create value by leveraging the 3M fundamental strengths of technology, manufacturing, global footprint and brand. We're winning with commercial excellence in how we engage our customers, transform our channels and focus on strategic global markets. We're executing portfolio management to increase customer relevance, growth and enterprise value. We're investing in innovation to create differentiated high-impact new products that help us gain profitable market share in both new and existing markets. And we're increasing our competitive advantage through business formation. I'm going to cover each of these strategies and priorities in my presentation today. \r\nSo here, you can see that strong performance reflected in 5% growth on both the top and bottom line. That growth comes from industry-leading positions in product platforms, abrasives, adhesives, tapes and advanced materials. It also comes from a mix of high-growth market-facing businesses in automotive, aerospace and filtration. That growth also comes from a mix of market-leading positions in every region in the world. \r\nOur businesses, taken together, form an industrial powerhouse with broad market reach, unique technologies and leading brands. We operate in the most attractive industrial  markets around the world and we outgrow them. We leverage a majority of 3M technologies to create differentiated industrial product platforms, and we go-to-market with industry and category-leading brands. \r\nWhen you look at the front end of our business, we successfully engage customers through multiple go-to-market models. Our industrial businesses serve a wide variety of customers, from large global OEMs to small local customers. We do this through multiple go-to-market models ranging from direct sales to global key accounts, to industrial distribution to e-commerce. \r\nWhen you step back and look at our products sales at a high level, it can be divided into 2 categories. The majority of our sales comes from what we call designed-in or specified products. Examples of this would be products that would go into the building materials for manufacturing of appliances. It might also be products that are specified in the process to refurbish aircraft. \r\nOn the consumables side, you'd see products like abrasives and tapes that are used in general manufacturing and construction processes. In order to win across this wide variety of customers and these go-to-market models and in these designed-in consumable spaces, we need to focus on these key areas. So we're focused on accelerating our designed-in sales, we're focused on improving our key account management. \r\nWe're partnering with converters and storefronts. Converters are customers who buy jumbo rolls of our materials and then convert them into form factors that are used in the manufacturing of -- by their customers and their manufacturing processes. These are typically finished goods manufacturers. Storefronts are outlets all over the world that serve those small local customers. A good example of this would be [indiscernible] in Latin America. We're also aligning to changes in the B2B channels. A good example of this is accelerating growth that we see through e-commerce. \r\nFor the rest of my presentation, I want to highlight our strategies and priorities through the eyes of our 3 key levers. So let's start with portfolio management. Portfolio management for us is really about prioritization, and we're leveraging prioritization in our portfolios, in our businesses, and now, down to our product level. We're focusing on key markets and geographies, we're focusing on priority customers, and we're focused on winning against critical global, regional and local competitors. \r\nHere, you can see pictured how that prioritization shows up across our business group. On a portfolio level, we continue to look at our divisions, and I'll highlight some examples on how we are managing our division level -- our business level portfolio. We're also going down to the product level and prioritizing the highest growth opportunities there, and I'll cover each of these in a little more -- in just a moment. But we're also looking at our portfolio of leveraging pricing strategy to align the best mix to the local markets -- the best mix of our business to the local markets. We're focused on playbooks for both developed and developing markets, and I'll highlight some examples of this in just a moment. And then we're looking and focused on the priorities that we'll win in key markets around the world. \r\nKey accounts, as I said, are a key focus for us, both global and local key accounts. But we're also driving channel strategies like e-commerce to make sure we deliver best-in-class service to all of our customers. And we're taking our analysis and focus on competitors deeper, driving action plans against those critical global, regional and local competitors. You take all this together, and we're taking our prioritization broader and deeper to help drive growth and create greater value. \r\nAs I said, portfolio management, at a business level, is still critical. It's helping us, as Inge said, to increase relevance with our customers and create greater shareholder value. In 2014, we combined a couple of our businesses into other businesses in the Industrial Business Group. We integrated our personal care business into our industrial adhesives and tapes business to take advantage of synergies on both the front end and the back end of those 2 businesses. We also realigned our defense markets business with the Ceradyne integration. And as I said, we're taking this portfolio management down to the product level. We've identified the highest growth opportunities and we shifted a significant portion of our R&D, SG&A and capital investments to those priority growth opportunities. \r\nAs I said we've got playbooks for the highest priority countries in both developed and developing markets. Our global teams are working with our country teams to develop very sharply focused playbooks, which identify where we want to play: Markets, customers and geographies; and then, what it's going to take to win, what is the best playbook to win. In our developed economies and markets, we're focused on winning share. In our developing markets, we're focused on increasing penetration and driving accelerated growth. And we're executing all of this with a Plan-Do-Check-Act discipline, which is helping us to outgrow those markets across the world. \r\nLet's turn to investing in innovation. In Industrial business, in our investment in innovation strategies, we're shifting investments to those high-impact new projects. We're building new platforms based on customer insights, using processes like customer-inspired innovation. We're accelerating the growth of something that I'm calling, new core product platforms, and I'm going to explain this in a little more detail in just a moment. And then we're driving consistent execution globally and locally. \r\nTo really see the impact of our investments in innovation, I think it's important to step back and look at what's going on in growth in the introduction phase, as well as the growth phase of a product life cycle. That introduction phase is vital to us in 3M. We have to continue to grow this year-over-year. We focus our innovation here on global new products for new and existing markets and also on reinventing ourselves in the local -- with local new products. \r\nReally, most of our products continue to grow well past this introduction phase, some of these become game changers. Those game changers really reshape the core of our product platforms. They become new core for us. And we need to leverage the high growth from these new core platforms and make sure we're prioritizing our investments there. In all of this, we're trying to focus on maximizing our R&D investment and prioritize the highest impact projects. So one of the ways we prioritize these projects is through customer insights. And as Inge highlighted, we use 2 processes to really develop those customer insights. We use customer-inspired innovation for our designed in products and we use i2i for our consumable products. \r\nAs Inge highlighted, that CII process is a very much a one-to-one deep engagement with our customers. It leads to innovative new products and applications. The products you see pictured here are products we introduced in 2014 based on that process. Lightning Strike Protection Film for use in the construction of composite aircraft. New Advanced Ceramics Friction Shims, which help to reduce the weight and improve the performance of automobile transmissions. And then new attachment systems as our customers in the automobile industry bring in new materials that require new bonding solutions. \r\nOn the i2i side, our consumable products, one of the great applications of this, looking across a broad customer set, is the simplification that we did in our masking tape portfolio. We went from more than 2 dozen masking tape -- 2 dozen masking tape products, down to a simplified portfolio of 5, and we're driving double-digit growth off of that simplification. We're also using i2i to expand our pain application systems and, actually, to introduce entirely new platforms like the air barrier product portfolio that you see pictured here. So engaging our customers this way really helps drive our innovation and helps to prioritize our best ideas. \r\nFocusing on these insights is also helping to fill up our product pipeline with high-quality new products. These are 3 different categories of investments that we're leveraging to drive innovation. The first in investing innovation is leveraging corporate-sponsored investments, as Inge talked about, to introduce new products for new markets. An example of that is Liquid Air Barrier we introduced in 2014 to help build-out that air barrier portfolio. We also introduced an entirely new class of  protective films called Crystal Silk for use in the manufacturer of both electronics and appliances. \r\nIn our industrial businesses, we're working on extending our platforms into new markets and new applications. A great example is our glass bubble platform. This year we've introduced new and differentiated performing glass bubbles that extend into new markets and new applications. We also are taking our Cubitron II precision-shaped ceramic grain technology from our coated abrasives applications into other applications like cut-off wheels you see pictured here. And then our local R&D efforts and teams are focused on reinventing close to the customer. And here, you see a couple of examples, 1 from our Korea team on Interam insulated matting, which is used in the manufacture of catalytic converters, and also residential water filtration for the China market. Expanding our product platforms into these high-growth opportunities is a big advantage from all of these investments. \r\nSo here, I've highlighted some examples of what I'd call the new core platforms for our Industrial business. Each of these new core platforms has, in common, that they leverage deeply the 4 fundamental strengths from 3M. Technology, manufacturing, our global capabilities and brand. The first one, investing -- based on some investments to innovate new structural adhesives, we now have the most compressive adhesive portfolio in the world. We're leveraging that to drive double-digit growth in key markets. In 2009, we introduced Cubitron II, the precision-shaped ceramic grain technology, into coated abrasives. This was a whole new -- really created a whole new category of performance. We're now taking that same technology and that same advantage in performance into precision-bonded abrasives like the cut-off wheel I saw -- you saw pictured earlier. But also, into precision grinding and finishing products, like the products pictured here that we added with the Winterthur acquisition. \r\nWe've been innovating and continue to innovate in our Thinsulate platform, and we're leveraging that now to bring the best-in-class acoustic solutions to automobile construction. \r\nSo we take these 3 new core platforms for Industrial Business Group. Together, they'll deliver more than $600 million over the next 3 years. \r\nLet's turn to our last lever, business transformation. We'll leveraging business transformation to become more effective and efficient in how we serve our customers. We're using it to drive improvements in our supply chain performance in our cost of goods sold. It really is extending our competitive advantage. \r\nOn the front side of our business, customer-facing side, it;s helping to create best-in-class fulfillment. It's providing complete visibility for our customers across the supply chain. It's helping us to drive increased growth and productivity. On the supply chain side, we're leveraging global lean value streams and a coordinated global supply to improve our cycle times and inventory turns. All of this is transforming our customers' experience and helping us to drive down the cost to serve and cost to supply. And while we're implementing those business transformation strategies, we're working everyday in our businesses to optimize our supply chain and reduce our cost of goods sold. \r\nIn our supply chain, we are leveraging those Centers of Excellence Inge talked about to reduce cycle times, improve our plant and asset utilization and increase our inventory turns. Reducing COGS is critical to our future performance and carrying that strong performance forward. We're leveraging Lean Six Sigma and disruptive cost-out innovation to improve our productivity, improve our yields and reduce our waste. Delivering this continuous improvement in COGS is how we fund those investments in innovation. \r\nSo these strategies and priorities are how we are bringing the 3M vision to life in industrial markets. They are how we will continue this strong performance well into the future, growing our global industrial powerhouse to over $15 billion in sales by 2019. Thank you. \r\nI'll now turn it over to H.C. Shin for update on international operations. Thanks, H.C.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Hak Shin (Executives)】\nThank you, Mike. Good morning, everybody. My great pressure to talk about international operations. So I'm going to talk about landscape a little bit, how we are responding to kind of a tumultuous landscape. Talk about strategy a little bit, and then how we execute. \r\nInternational is a strong and sustainable growth platform. The size of $20 billion in sales this year, 23% operating income. We're operating in 72 subsidiaries. We have laboratories in 35 countries with over 4,000 R&D employees located outside the United States. Our ability to reach end-user customers, anywhere in the world, by the people who really understand the local culture, is the reason why these global capabilities is 1 of 4 fundamental strengths of the company. \r\nOver the past 5 years, we're able to grow at 5%, strong growth record, organic local currency to sales with top $20 billion this year, with 23% operating income. Our plan is to continue the growth momentum into the next several years, 6% organic local currency growth for the next several years. And the growth will come from both developing and developed economies. Very critical that we grow both in developing and developed, and we have a playbook to win in both developing and developed economies. \r\nThere are lots of dynamics happening, as you know, around the world in any given year, ranging from local currency devaluation, all the way to tumultuous geopolitical events or even natural calamities. 3M has a well laid out playbook to respond to this situation very quickly and very effectively when they arise. For example, in 2014, we successfully overcame severe local currency devaluation around the world through very disciplined pricing management actions, meaning increases in most cases, right? We also managed our cash flow and balance sheet very effectively in abnormal circumstances like in Venezuela, again, by the people who have done this before and who know exactly what to do under the circumstances. \r\nSo let's talk about strategy. We are basically operational in corporate strategy, 6 strategies. Our guiding principle is around 3 strategic levers, namely portfolio management, investing in innovation and business transformation. In doing so, we were able to post a strong financial result. Year-to-date September, our organic local currency growth was 4.5% at 23% operating income. Our growth momentum is accelerating, and our strong operational excellence discipline continues to drive margin. \r\nOur strategies are powered by our people. People are at the center of our global strategy execution. To attract highly qualified and diverse global talent, we put in place some very unique and innovative hiring practices. For example, we have a targeted international Ph.D. hiring program from many top universities around the world. We also are tapping international society for female engineers. We also have a program to hire highly qualified Saudi nationals in U.S. colleges, train them in the United States and send them back to Saudi Arabia to work in 3M operation in the kingdom. Once we hire the people, then, we really develop them through comprehensive leadership training programs, both in terms of specialty area, as well as general leadership programs. So we'll continue to invest in people and leadership development. \r\nSo let's talk about 3 key strategic levers, starting from portfolio management. Over the past 2.5 years, 3 years, under Chairman's direction, we vigorously implemented portfolio management strategy in International. Our actions were focused on shifting resources and headcount toward Heartland and Push Forward divisions. We also allocated capital differently based upon portfolio priorities. We also put R&D investment and M&A in different buckets relative to portfolio priorities. In doing so, our Push Forward divisions are now growing at the fastest, 6%, followed by Heartland divisions at 4%. In implementing this portfolio management strategy, we were able to generate more sustainable domestic demand-driven businesses like Health Care, Consumer Retail and Personal Safety businesses, which obviously helped us build more balanced portfolio mix in our business. \r\nOur geography portfolio plan calls for growing 9% in developing market and 3% in developed market. The core essence of our growth strategy in these 2 markets is to convert local and regional megatrends -- there are lots of them by the way, to faster commercialization. And for example, in developing markets, we can really capitalize on air quality in many countries, or water quality, big problem around the world. Food safety, a huge issue in many countries. Infrastructure building. So those are the types of society-defining megatrends that we can turn into faster commercialization in developing markets. \r\nSame is true in developed market like in West Europe. We can also capitalize on opportunities like sustainability, energy savings or health care solutions relative to aging populations. That's how we want to grow in both developing and developing -- developed markets. \r\nThese are the top 15 countries and regions where most of the growth will come from in the next few years. So we can see the countries here: China, Southeast Asia, Brazil, Korea, Japan, Mexico and a few countries in West Europe. So those are the countries where most of growth will come from, kind of our usual suspects, as you can imagine. \r\nI'm going to specifically talk about China, Southeast Asia, Japan and West Europe in my following slides, starting from China. We have been operating in China since 1984. We have a very large and very profitable business, over $4 billion business. We have a very good and very large manufacturing supply chain and R&D footprint in China.  But you know what, we concluded that we can do more in China. Hence, the creation of so-called new China plan in 2012, 2 years ago. New China plan callid for growing our business in China from $4 billion to $5.5 billion by doing things differently. There are 4 things that we are doing differently now: First, we invest more in local megatrend-driven product development and marketing in China to really take advantage of their domestic-driven economy. Number two, we expand regionally into West region particularly and North region. Third, we also focus on productivity improvement using Lean Six Sigma discipline. So it's not just growth, we're also focusing on productivity in addition to growth. And then, we continue to invest in our human capital capabilities. So those are the 4 things that we do differently to bring China to the next level. \r\nOur new China plan is fundamentally based upon much deeper and more systematic understanding of China as a country. As China continues to evolve to the next stage of economic development as was stipulated in 12th 5-year economic plan, we see a vast array of opportunity to convert those domestic megatrends to commercialization. For example, we are already investing heavily in air quality programs, water purification issues, water quality problems or health care programs, automotive, and they're getting some great success from these programs. All domestic, all indigenous toward China local megatrends. I'll just take  one example to get a little deeper into the program to explain what I mean by very local domestic programs. The air quality issue in China is well-known. It is an environmental issue and health issue at the same time. People in Beijing or Shanghai wake up in the morning and start the day by checking what they call AQI or Air Quality Index. So we can see the number here. The safe level of AQI is considered around 50. And as you can see in the chart, in many days, in many cities, it's well beyond 130 or 150. So public awareness is clearly there. \r\n2 years ago, 3M introduced consumer respirator program. The program is designed to provide proprietary 3M respiratory protection technology to general Chinese consumers. Again, the product was designed, manufactured in China at a price point that should be affordable to general China consumers. Then we made them available ubiquitously. They can buy it in the supermarket. They go to drug store, they can pick it up. They can go to mass retailers, they can buy it. Or through a website like alibaba.com. We are already having a great success in year 2. In fact, just this opportunity alone, the air quality in China could be multi-hundreds of millions dollars opportunity, very profitable for 3M. \r\nSo this is our playbook. This is how we're going to grow in China. Growing with the economy, growing with society. And we can replicate to other megatrends, like water quality or food safety. Or we can take the example in China and replicate in Indonesia, for example. So this is how 3M will continue to grow in developing market. \r\n3M Japan is the second largest subsidiary of 3M, with $2.2 billion sales. As you know, the country went through tragic tsunami event in 2011 and, recently, very severe local currency devaluation. Now [indiscernible] just responding to the situation in Japan, our team in Japan, I think is thriving in this challenging landscape. 3M Japan, which became, as you know, wholly-owned subsidiary of 3M recently, is in great shape. They are outgrowing market, outgrowing IPI in a big way. In fact, it is expected that 3M Japan will finish 2014 with 10.4% organic local currency growth at 33% operating income. So we are very proud of our team in Japan and quite happy about our operation in Japan. How did they do that? Again, by focusing on portfolio, simplification, portfolio management, to less and do it well. At the same time, also focused on megatrends like domestic, Health Care, Consumer Retail as well as Personal Safety. \r\nSoutheast Asia is a growing region. This could be the next growth platform for 3M. We already have $1 billion, a very profitable business. And opportunity here is associated with the very large number of emerging middle-class consumers. Oh by the way, over 800 million people who's got money now, ready to spend. \r\nOur strategy here, too, really is to take advantage of our Singapore super hub capability. Since 1998, we invested over $800 million in Singapore to build a very sophisticated  manufacturing and R&D platform. So we can use this to capitalize on megatrend opportunity there, like automotive, we provide more cars there; middle-class income consumers; consumer business; oil and gas; as well as electronics and health care. So our growth momentum in Southeast Asia region is going very well. We have very high expectations for Southeast Asia to continue to grow. \r\nWest Europe is a must-win geography for us. We already have a very large presence, 17% of 3M sales is coming from West Europe. We have a very large footprint. Complete self-sufficient capability in terms of manufacturing supply chain and R&D. If you take a look at West Europe as a marketplace. For us, it's a growth market. They have a very large consumer base, and West Europe is also the home location for numerous number of global corporations who are leading the global trend in the areas like sustainability, like technology, like innovation. And our plan there is simply to follow corporate strategy, focus on portfolio simplification and prioritization; do less, but do it well; and really capitalize on uniquely European innovation. And at the same time, also focus on productivity program, like regionalization, meaning, instead of going country-by-country in small countries, why don't we close the country into more regional structure. At the same time, we also consolidated all of our supply chain footprint in West Europe into 1 location in Switzerland, which I'm going to touch on later. \r\nHere's one example of uniquely European innovation. 3M has an advanced materials solutions, lightweight material. Basically, this is for aerospace and automotive industries. This material and technology that can make things lighter in aerospace parts and automotive parts. And that's a good news from the perspective of sustainability and energy efficiency. Not only do we have 1 technology, we have many technologies to make things lighter and more energy-efficient. I'll just take one example. Glass bubbles. This is a hollow glass microsphere, very small. The diameter of somewhere between 30 to 50 micron. It is a filler material that can be mixed with plastics or composites, and basically made into automotive or aerospace parts can reduce the weight of the parts as much as 15%. And that's a good news for the industry. So we are commercializing this. We have already commercialized this with large aerospace and automotive OEMs in Europe. So people talk about Europe as a slow growth, it is true, but there are high-growth segments in Europe, such as this. This particular segment, which is large, the $2 billion-plus addressable market size is growing somewhere between 8% to 15%. And this is how we're going to grow in developed markets. There are segments that we can unleash 3M technology to take advantage of the trend like sustainability, like lightweight material. That's how we're going to grow in developed economies. \r\nIn terms of investing in innovation, our plan is to continue to invest in R&D, as you heard from our Chairman, and marketing as well. You heard we have lots of ideas, right, in terms of how we grow in local markets, in local megatrend. The reason we are investing in R&D is to convert those opportunities to commercialization. That's why we are increasing and stepping up our R&D investment as far as marketing. For example, we continue to invest in our Customer Technical Centers around the world. Right now, we have 46 Customer Technical Centers around the world. We keep adding 1 or 2 a year, we keep investing in this Customer Technical Centers capability. We are also shifting the center of gravity in our technology development. So right now, corporate research activities was all coming from U.S. Now, we are shifting the center of gravity to locations like China, Germany and Japan. Again, the reason we are doing it is to really take advantage of opportunities residing in the region, residing in those countries. For example, air, water, safety, and the list goes on and on. \r\nI'll just take a couple of examples of what I mean by local megatrend-driven innovation. In Japan, 3M commercialized viscoelastic materials, basically, sticky material, elastic material that can be inserted in the form of damper in between building structure like warehouse. What it does is it maximizes the resistance against vibration caused by earthquake. So that's a very, very good thing for a lot of warehouse structure in Japan, and we are already getting some very, very good success with this particular, very local innovation in Japan. The second one, water purification. We talked about air in China. We're having a very good success with water. Water quality's as much of a problem in China as it is with air quality. So 3M has a very comprehensive air purification capability for house. So what we did is to set up over 2,000 individual kiosks in large cities in China. So consumers can bring their home water sample. They can get a test immediately, right on the spot in the kiosks, they can get a report right on the spot, they can get a recommendation what types of system they need right on the spot. In fact, if they want, they can make a purchase right on the spot.  So these types of program is really unique to China, and we have many, many examples like that, that we call local megatrend-driven innovation. That's how we're going to grow in international, going forward. \r\nIn terms of business transformation, we are able to continue to drive down our cost of goods sold, as you see here, and we were able to do that through rigorous use of Lean Six Sigma. And we are stepping up Lean Six Sigma. We are increasing the number of black belts to take it to the next level to make sure that we continue to focus on productivity improvement, in addition to finding the way to grow. In fact, all of this will be enabled by a single instance global ERP that's now being deployed, and that will be a critical enabler to make all this possible by connecting all the data points around the world in all functions and all countries. \r\nOur supply chain of the future is hinged on the idea that instead of going country-by-country, if we can consolidate all supply chain assets into one location in the region, we can create a lot more -- we can create a lot more productivity, that's the thinking. For example, in EMEA, we established a supply chain Center of Excellence in Switzerland. So now it controls all supply chain assets in EMEA. It's a great thing from the standpoint of asset utilization. In fact, we also selected Singapore as the regional location for Asia-Pacific. We already launched our Panama Pacifico operation in Panama. So these 3 hubs of supply chain will act as a center of excellence to consolidate manufacturing assets to maximize asset utilization. And by the way, those 3 locations happen to be very tax efficient locations. That's how we will modernize and continue to maximize our efficiency in supply chain. \r\nThis is one example. EMEA supply chain in [indiscernible], Switzerland. It consolidate all 49 individual plants under 1 entity now in Switzerland. That covers almost over $6 billion worth of sales value and production. And as our Chairman told you, we successfully deployed ERP in all those locations. What it does is that it really drives asset utilization and drive the cost down in our cost of goods sold. Significant cost saving opportunity in an opportunity like this. Oh by the way, it happens to be located in tax-efficient location. \r\nSo in summary, I think international is a strong and proven growth platform. We have a very strong operational excellence discipline, but we see very large and untapped local market opportunities based upon megatrends. So our plan is to continue to invest in R&D and marketing to commercialize those opportunities. And we are doing all of these through our proud global talents. So that was our story from international. \r\nIt's my pleasure to introduce, Nick Gangestad, the CFO of the company.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Nicholas Gangestad (Executives)】\nThank you. Thanks, H.C. Good morning, everyone. I'm Nick Gangestad, 3M's CFO and it is great to be with you this morning. \r\nYou've heard Inge talk about 3M's strategies. You've heard Frank, Mike and H.C. talk about those strategies in execution and how they're impacting our businesses and geographies. And I'll wrap-up the prepared portion of our agenda this morning by covering 3 items: First, I'll give an update on 3M's capital structure and allocation strategy; I'll cover our 2015 earnings outlook; and then I'll give you an update on our 2013 to 2017 5-year plan that we first introduced 2 years ago. \r\n3M has a long history of a strong capital structure and then generating strong cash flow. One year ago, in this very room, we announced an update to enhance 3M's capital structure strategy. We felt that we could lower 3M's total cost of capital by using low-cost debt and return cash to shareholders and invest in our business, investing organically in our business remains our top priority, as evidenced by our investments in research and development, which you've heard everyone before me talk about this morning, as well as CapEx. \r\nTo augment that organic growth, our capital plan -- capital deployment plan calls for $5 billion to $10 billion to be spent on mergers and acquisitions over the 5-year period. We're doing this in a way where we're maintaining flexibility to be able to respond to strategic opportunities as they arise. Those actions started last year, and we're continuing the action in 2014. And I'm going to summarize what we've been doing in 2014 as part of our capital structure, capital allocation strategy. You see them summarized on this slide here, and I'll go into detail in each of these. \r\nFirst, investing in our organic business is our top priority, as evidenced by our investment in research and development and CapEx. As part of our capital deployment plan, we've allowed for research and development expense to move to 6% of revenue by the year 2017. We're earmarking that incremental investment to go towards disruptive innovation that can develop new products for new markets.  \r\nIn 3M, we use a metric, an index called NPVI, New Product Vitality Index, to measure the amount of revenue that 3M is generating from products that have been introduced in the last 5 years. For 2014, we are estimating that index to be 33%. \r\nWe do this investment in innovation to increase our relevance to our customers, and it also creates the benefit of enhancing our operating margins and return on invested capital. \r\nThe second-place we're investing organically in the business is in CapEx, both innovation, which I just talked about, and manufacturing, that I'm talking about now, are 2 of the fundamental strengths that you've heard talked about repeatedly this morning. The way we deploy our CapEx is aligned with our portfolio prioritization process. 3M has flexible manufacturing assets that can be deployed across 3M's product lines, the same manufacturing asset can be manufacturing 3M products across multiple businesses. We're also vertically integrated in that we manufacture many of the raw materials that we use in production. Examples of that are our films and other chemicals that go into 3M -- into 3M products. \r\nWe are going to continue that investment in CapEx. We're expecting in 2015 to spend between $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion on CapEx. And over the 5-year time horizon, we expect our CapEx spending to average approximately 5% to revenue. \r\nM&A is another part of our capital allocation strategy. And I'm going to share a slide that we've shared for the last 2 years. This is where we show how we are doing with the deals that we have -- the M&A deals that we have completed. The message is more or less unchanged. The acquisitions that 3M has completed since 2009 are exceeding our expectations. Our portfolio pipeline is aligned around our prioritization process as well as we're focused on end markets that are accretive to 3M and also have the capability of generating sustainable returns for 3M. Part of our strategy has been to build a center to the -- a central organization within 3M, which can drive 3M integration faster and more effective.  Another part of our pipeline strategy is that we are looking for targets where our 4 fundamental strengths can be used to add value. \r\nWe've also, in 2014, deployed approximately $1 billion to mergers and acquisitions. We have 2 -- the 2 deals we've completed, listed here. We purchased the remaining 25% of our Sumitomo 3M operations, a company that's been in existence over 50 years in which 3M has had 100% control of operation for many of those years. That deployed $865 million of our international cash. And on the right-hand side, we spent approaching $100 million on our Treo acquisition in the health care information systems as a way to accelerate our entry into the health care analytics space. Both of these deals are exceeding our sales and revenue expectations from the time we made that -- the purchases. \r\nThe third part of our capital allocation strategy that we're executing this year is returning cash to shareholders. As Inge mentioned earlier this morning, we announced a 20% increase to our dividend for Q1 2015. That's on top of a 35% increase in 2014. And this moves our payout ratio for 2015 to approximately 15%. We expect that future increases will be in line with earnings growth over the coming years. \r\nShare repurchases are another way we're returning cash to shareholders. We had a range where we were estimating $17 billion to $22 billion over the 5-year time horizon to be allocated to share repurchases. 2 years in, we estimate we will be at approximately $11 billion. Therefore, we're upping the bottom end of that range to $20 billion for a new range over the 5-year period of $20 billion to $22 billion. \r\nOur approach, as we buy back shares is twofold: First, we have a disciplined minimum amount that we are constantly in the market investing in share repurchases; and then we have a second discretionary amount, which fluctuates up or down based on relative value and the other uses of cash we see coming at 3M. Over the 5-year time horizon, we expect this to be 3% earnings accretive to earnings per share. \r\nThe last area I'll talk about, about capital allocation and capital structure, is net debt. There's 2 components to that. First, cash. We've been working to minimize global cash while keeping ourselves flexible. We've been managing our U.S. cash balance to minimal levels. And as you can see on the graph, most of our cash is in our international operations. Part of our strategy is to deploy our cash organically where that cash is being generated. We're working to deploy that cash. This acquisition of Sumitomo 3M Japan is one example of that. We're also -- we also repatriate money from our international companies to the U.S. to the extent we can do it tax efficiently. \r\nThrough the first 9 months of this year, we have increased our net debt by $2.3 billion. We're doing this as part of our strategy to lower our total cost of capital by taking advantage of low-cost debt. This increase in net debt has been a function of the cash reduction which I showed on the other slide, and the issuance of $2.5 billion of term debt during the year. We've had 2 different offerings with terms ranging from 4 years to 30 years, all of them at favorable rates. For 2015, we are expecting to increase our leverage by $3 billion to $5 billion. \r\n3M's pension team is also managing our global pension obligations well. We are largely complete with the structural changes to our defined benefit plans. We have closed most of those plans, migrating them to defined contribution plans. We estimate that we will end this year at an 87% funded level globally, and that's down from the -- from a 94% funded status at the end of 2013. There are 2 primary drivers for that decline: First, we're anticipating approximately an 80-basis-point decline in discount rates in the U.S. for our pension; and second, we're adopting a new mortality table in the U.S. We had been on the BB scale mortality table in the U.S. and we're moving to RP 2014 as of the end of this year.  Our cash contributions we expect to remain relatively flat between $100 million and $200 million per year over the next 3 years. \r\nSo to sum it all up, we see 2015 as another strong year in our capital allocation model. We will have between $15 billion and $17 billion of capital available to 3M coming from our cash flow from operations, excluding R&D, including our cash and marketable securities on hand and including $3 billion to $5 billion of added leverage. Our deployment strategy is also strong. We first will invest in our business, our organic business, with R&D and CapEx approaching $3.5 billion. And over the 5-year time horizon, as I've mentioned before, we expect M&A to be between $5 billion and $10 billion. We also expect 2015 to be another strong year of returning cash to shareholders. \r\nNow let's turn our focus to earnings. Before I talk about our outlook for 2015, I'll just make a few comments about what we're seeing as 2014 comes to an end. We're seeing worldwide organic volume growth tracking in line with recent trends we have seen in 3M. We're continuing to see the U.S. dollar strengthen during the fourth quarter, and we're -- and no surprise, we're seeing commodity prices decline, which will benefit 3M even further into 2015. We're also taking actions during this quarter to rationalize our portfolio. We've taken actions in some of our businesses in Western Europe, which we expect to incur a cost of $30 million in the fourth quarter. And yesterday, we announced the divestiture of our static control business within the E&E business of 3M. We expect that deal to close in first quarter of next year. \r\nNow onto 2015. We're expecting GAAP earnings per share to be between $8 and $8.30. And if I compare that to the midpoint of our current guidance for 2014, that's a 7% to 11% increase in earnings per share. We expect our organic local currency growth to be between 3% and 6%, and we expect the strong dollar to reduce sales in U.S. dollars by 2% to 3% next year. We're expecting our tax rate to be between 28% and 29% next year, and we anticipate free cash flow conversion between 90% and 100%. \r\nHere's our road map on the components that explain how we will go from our current 2014 results to our $8 to $8.30 range next year. And I'll comment on each of these components in the coming slides. But before I leave this slide, I'll just comment on the minority interest components on the far right. \r\nWhen we first announced the acquisition of the remaining 25% of Sumitomo 3M in Japan, of our joint venture with Sumitomo 3M in Japan, we stated that we expected $0.08 earnings per share accretion over the course of the 12 calendar months following that deal. That deal closed on September 1. The first $0.03 of that earnings per share accretion we will have experienced in 2014 and what you've seen noted here is the remaining $0.05 of EPS accretion which we expect in 2015. \r\nNow onto organic growth. We expect organic growth to increase earnings per share for 3M by $0.25 to $0.50. This is based on our estimate that we will grow organic local currency sales by 3% to 6%. That 3% to 6% is largely unit volume-driven. And if you compare that to our estimation of global Industrial Production Index, we're estimating that to be between 2.5% and 3.5%. We expect 3M's growth in developing markets to be between 5% and 10% in 2015, and we expect our growth in developed markets to be between 2% and 5%. Those growth figures I just mentioned are organic local currency growth. \r\nIf I take that growth and break that down by business and geography, Health Care, we're expecting to lead the way for growth in 3M with 4% to 7% organic growth. Our Industrial business, Safety and Graphics business and Consumer business, we are all expecting to grow organically between 3% and 6%. And our Electronics and Energy business, we're expecting to grow between 2% and 6% in 2015. \r\nIf I turn this to look at our growth by geographic area of the world, our largest area of the world, the United States, we anticipate growth between 3% and 6%. EMEA, we are expecting growth between 0% and 4%. The Western European portion of that, we're expecting between negative 2% and positive 2% organic local currency growth with our Central East Europe and Middle East Africa regions being accretive to that overall area growth. Our Asia-Pacific growth, we're estimating between 3% and 8%, with our China growth in the mid- to high-single digits, and our Japan growth in the low-single digits. And then, finally, our Latin America/Canada area, we're expecting to grow between 5% and 8%, primarily driven by growth in Latin America. \r\nNow let's move to the impact foreign currency will have on 3M's earnings. The stronger U.S. dollar we're expecting to reduce earnings per share in 2015 by $0.10 to $0.20, and this is net of hedging. 3M has a strategy of hedging approximately 50% of our economic exposure. One of our actions we took earlier in 2014 was to extend the tenor on our hedging in certain developed market currencies where we moved from 12 year -- 12 months out of economic exposure to 24 months out of economic exposure. \r\nIn the case of raw materials, we're expecting to experience raw material tailwinds for the fourth year in a row in 3M. We're expecting this to increase earnings per share between $0.15 and $0.25. In 3M, we spend approximately $8 billion a year on raw materials and purchased finished goods. And of that $8 billion, approximately $1.5 billion is spent on oil-related derivative raw materials. Total raw materials make up approximately half of 3M's total cost of goods sold or about 25% of our sales are spent on raw materials and purchased finished goods. These savings that I'm talking about here, the $0.15 to $0.25 are being driven by market-driven prices, which we're seeing and experiencing today, is driven by efforts from 3M's global sourcing organization and where appropriate, raw material substitutions. \r\n2015 will be a year in which 3M continues to make strategic investments. It's part of 3M's business model to reinvest in the business to enable even more productivity in the future. So our strategic investments in 2015 will come in 3 areas: First, we're going to continue to invest in our business transformation program, which you've heard talked about. We expect our year-on-year spending on business transformation in 2015 to be flat with what we spent in 2014. We will continue to increase our investment in disruptive innovation, disruptive technology, aimed at creating new products for new markets. And in 2015, we anticipate we will continue to take portfolio actions to improve our portfolio and increase operational efficiency. In total,, these strategic investments, we expect to reduce earnings per share for 3M by $0.05 to $0.10. \r\nNet productivity will be accretive to 3M's earnings per share in 2015. We're expecting productivity to increase earnings per share between $0.10 and $0.20. This will also increase 3M's operating margin by approximately 50 basis points in 2015. There are several things driving this earnings per share benefit. Part of it is our investments in portfolio actions and prioritizations that have already occurred. Part of it is our supply chain Centers of Excellence, which you heard H.C. talk about. But it's also being driven by our efforts around Lean Six Sigma and the increased productivity that we're seeing from those dedicated resources.  And on the next slide, I'll show you what we are doing with resources dedicated to Lean Six Sigma. Our low point for resources dedicated to Lean Six Sigma was in 2011 with 372 people devoted to that -- to those programs. We have been continually increasing our resources going into Lean Six Sigma, and we expect that trend to continue, and we're doing that to drive the savings that you see on the right-hand side. We're seeing those savings increase by approximately 5% per year. And by 2017, we expect that to be approaching $1.5 billion, which is a necessary thing we need to do to offset other costs that are increasing in 3M, such as inflation.\r\nPension will be a headwind for 3M in 2015. We expect our -- the earnings per share impact to reduce earnings per share by $0.10 to $0.20. And as I've mentioned earlier, this will be driven by declines in our discount rate in the United States and the adoption of a new mortality table.\r\nPartially offsetting those declines are a couple of things. First, our return on asset performance in the U.S. will be a benefit. Year-to-date, our asset return in the United States is approximately 13%. This is -- our pension expense next year will also be benefited by plan changes we have made whereby we are offering lump sum payouts to retiring employees. Our assumptions for next year: we are leading our return on asset assumption unchanged at 7.75%. And while this will be an increase in 2015, we anticipate that pension expense in both 2016 and 2017 will be a decline. Over the 5-year time horizon, we expect this to be 1% accretive on average to our earnings per share.\r\nTaxes. We anticipate our tax rate to be between 28% and 29% in 2015. We are targeting that our tax rate will be at 27% by 2017, driven by our structural changes that we are making. You heard H.C. talk about our supply chain centers of excellence that have been established in Europe, in Panama and in Singapore. We expect that those benefits will be a key enabler to move our tax rate to 27% by 2017. Our tax rate guidance for both 2014 and for 2015 are based on the assumption that R&D tax credits will be in place for each of these years.\r\nShare repurchases. This is a continuation of our capital deployment strategy that I talked about earlier. We expect this to improve 3M's earnings per share in 2015 by $0.30 to $0.40. We are estimating that we will deploy between $3 billion and $5 billion in gross share repurchases or $2 billion to $4 billion on a net basis. And over the time frame of the 5 years -- or excuse me, the time frame for 2015, we're expecting our average diluted shares outstanding to decrease by 3% to 4%.\r\nAnd then finally, as you might expect as we add more leverage, more debt to our balance sheet, we are also -- we will be seeing our debt interest expense go up in 2015. We expect that to reduce earnings per share by $0.05 to $0.10. This is all part of our strategy of lowering 3M's cost of capital.\r\nSo to sum this up, we're expecting GAAP earnings per share between $8 and $8.30. We're expecting organic local currency growth between 3% and 6%. We anticipate a tax rate between 28% and 29% and free cash flow conversion between 90% and 100%.\r\nFor the last portion of my agenda, I'm going to talk about our 5-year plan that we talked about in November of 2012. 2015 will mark the midyear point of that 5-year plan, and I thought it would be wise to give an update on how we're seeing the components of that plan developing. There were 4 financial metrics that we discussed as part of our 5-year plan when we introduced that 2 years ago, the first being organic local currency growth. And at that time, we said we expect we should be able to grow organically between 4% and 6%. That was based on 2 assumptions: that the global industrial production would grow between 3% and 4% and using history as a guide, we saw our ability to grow 1.5x Industrial Production Index. That led us to the 4% to 6%. What we are seeing is industrial production tracking to the low end of that range, but fortunately, our ability to outperform industrial production is helping us stay in the 4% to 6% range. We've seen us move from a prior capability of growing 1.5x to approximately 1.7x multiple through the first 3 years of this plan. All of our businesses are contributing to this organic growth range, and we are on track to 4% to 6% organic growth over the 5-year time horizon.\r\nThe second financial metric we shared was earnings per share growth between 9% and 11%. And at the time we shared that, we laid out many of the factors that we saw giving 3M the ability to grow earnings per share 9% to 11% over this time frame. Several of those factors are performing, what, at the level we expected or better. Those include our organic revenue growth, our operating income margins, our tax rate and our share repurchases. Those items are offsetting what we're seeing of headwinds from a stronger U.S. dollar and pension expense tailwinds that are not quite as strong as what we had anticipated. For this metric as well, we see ourselves on track to the 9% to 11% earnings per share growth over the 5-year time horizon.\r\nThe third metric we shared was free cash flow conversion. 3M, over time, has been a company that can generate strong and consistent cash flow. Part of the reason we've put this metric forward is we saw the opportunity to move us to approximately 100% free cash flow conversion, driven by even more efficient use of our capital and by improving our working capital turns. With those factors, we see ourselves on track to achieving 100% free cash flow conversion over the 5-year time horizon as well.\r\nAnd then finally, return on invested capital. You've heard interest first through this morning 3M's 4 fundamental strengths: technology, manufacturing, global capability and our brand. Those strengths we see as primary drivers of 3M's ability to consistently drive and deliver returns on invested capital of approximately 20%. In addition, what we are doing by minimizing our cash balances and improving our asset efficiency, that's enhancing our ability to keep our return on invested capital in the range that we said. Over the 5-year time horizon, we continue to expect 3M to be able to deliver return on invested capital of approximately 20%.\r\nSo I'll close out the prepared portion for this morning by just showing the headlines that Inge started the morning with. 3M's having a strong 2014, and we're anticipating a delivery of a strong 2015. We have the 3M team that's executing well. And on a personal note, I've had the opportunity to meet many of you, enjoyed that interaction, and I'm looking forward to that continued interaction over the coming year.\r\nWith that, I'll -- I'd like you to give us about 2 minutes to get the chairs aligned for us to go now into the Q&A session.",
      "transcript_text3": "Okay. I think we're just rounding up H.C. He should be here in a minute. We're going to get started.\n\n---\n\nYes, let's start.\n\n---\n\nMaybe we could start. He'll be here in just a second. Go ahead, Cliff.\r\nThe mic attendant's right here.\n\n---\n\nIt's Cliff Ransom. I guess, this question is for Nick, but if any of the operating heads want to speak to it. You seem to talk about Lean Six Sigma as a short-term cost. My experience is that's pretty much of a pay-as-you-go metric, pay-as-you-go process. And then number two, I'm struck that when you talk about investing in Lean Six Sigma, you talked about the number of black belts. How would you respond to the thought that, that's the wrong metric? The metric is the one that your customers see, which is quality, delivery, cost, innovation and safety?\n\n---\n\nA few things and then others can chime in after me. We see our investments in Lean Six Sigma as just that, an investment. It happens to be one that gets very fast payback. As you can see by the graph that I was showing of the financial returns that we were generating, that most of our black belts that we put into Lean Six Sigma are generating returns that more than pay their salary the very first year they're in place. In terms of the part of the question on short-term versus long-term, part of what -- where we're going with Lean in 3M is how do we use Lean to redesign our supply chains in order to make our efficiency and effectiveness with our customers even better. And that's where we design processes that are focused on what's the most value-adding to our customers and taking out parts of the process that are not adding value to our customers. So especially in the Lean portion of Lean Six Sigma, we see relevance for that. The Six Sigma portion is largely directed at how do you take defects out of the process, defects that add cost or defects that can take away from the customer experience.\n\n---\n\nThere is a direct correlation, of course, in between the belt and the output, right? And I wouldn't like you to come across with the message that we are a company that are insular relative to look upon things we do internally only for the internal thing. Of course, everything we do has and should have a benefit for the customers. But in terms of Six Sigma, Mike Roman, as he's leading our biggest business -- maybe you, Mike, can make some comments relative to number of belts and the value for each and sort of how we do that in 1/3 of the company after we get the feeling for. So it's a good question actually around Lean Six Sigma.\n\n---\n\nYes, I think the way what Inge said it is right: it's correlated with the number of black belts, but it goes well beyond black belts. We have a green belt army that helps to deploy Lean Six Sigma projects, and we have Lean managers that are part of that deployment. But the black belts are an important leadership component of our Lean Six Sigma model. They are the ones out there, at a plant level, at an operational level, really marshaling the forces and really driving a Lean Six Sigma focus. We call it a Wave 1 intensity kind of focus for us in our Industrial business. So it is much more than the Black Belts, but that's an important element of that. We really want to focus on making sure we have that leadership around the world, really. And I would say, as Nick said, it's -- we get a very short-term return on that, but it has a long-term impact on our enterprise. And we're seeing 20%-plus of our savings now coming from Lean implementation, and that's a long-term payback. I mean, that continues to pay dividends for years to come.\n\n---\n\nI think also, yes, and we actually would like to talk about it for a second because it's an important element of the efficiency. So as you'll recall, there was a time in 3M where Six Sigma was embedded in many, many things starting back maybe in 2002 or something, went for 5, 6 years. Then came a period where maybe, if you like to use it, please go ahead and use it as a tool. You also see on the ramp-up, we are revitalizing Lean Six Sigma into the company, and it will stay there as we move forward, specifically in manufacturing and supply chain. And that's why I feel very encouraged relative to the momentum that is there now. I think everyone in 3M understand the benefit from it and all the focus we are putting on it. And we are a company, as you know, when we put emphasis from the center of the company in terms of initiative, we get it done, right? So I'm very encouraged in terms of what will happen in the next many years to come, right, so...\n\n---\n\nNext question. Ajay?\n\n---\n\nSo Inge, on one of your charts, you had the various divisions and you had 3 circles around the Heartland, Push Forward and the one Strategic Review, but there were some businesses that were outside those circles. Maybe just talk about how we should think about those businesses. Are those like cash cows? Or could they move to one of those circles over time?\n\n---\n\nYes, yes. So think about in this where -- when we started the journey, the first evaluation we did was to understand the value strategically and financially for the company and which business had more opportunity and, also specifically, which businesses have lagged the company for the last 5 years. We identified them under Strategic Review. The step that we call it in transition was businesses that, I would say, still had opportunity. But at least in my mind, our plan was not really clear, not really clear. Now if you think about that in terms of how we have addressed businesses under Strategic Review, which went from $2.5 billion to it's less than $500 million as we speak -- and by the way, that bubble is a collection of smaller businesses, right? So it's not one big business. It is small things that all the business groups now are addressing. Almost 3 years into the plan, you are not any longer in transition. You will have, by the end of this year moving into next year, a plan of where you are going. So I would say, you're not allowed in 3M to be a business under transition for that long time. The question at that point for me was: So what is the plan? We need to develop the plan together and make sure you'll get the resources you need or we have to do something else. So I think that was, I would say, was not the burning platform at all, if you were in transition. It was just like we need collectively to develop a plan, so you should not be in transition as you move ahead, right? You are -- and as I said, portfolio management is not the project; that's a process. So people will go in and out relative to what you need to have helped with. And my view of 3M, as we move ahead, when we started, if you got the information, you are under Strategic Review, that sounds bad, and it was maybe not the best place to be. When we move forward, if we're under Strategic Review, that's an opportunity. That's a Strategic Review based on an offensive mode, what can we do better in order to move forward. So that's my view on it.\n\n---\n\nJust one more, if I can sneak in. On pricing and in your model, you had pricing up next year. So maybe just big picture with the raw material environment kind of being benign, does that kind of limit your pricing opportunity next year? Or given that a lot of your products are consumable type and a lot of what you do is ban-driven, could you continue to get good pricing despite the weak raw material environment?\n\n---\n\nYes, there's multiple factors impacting pricing, exactly what you were talking about commodity prices having an impact on our ability to raise prices. Offsetting that is what's happening in the foreign exchange market. As many of you have probably heard me talk about before, especially in developing parts of the world, we often have the ability to adjust pricing to offset what's happening with FX, and that will be a positive impact on pricing in 2015.\n\n---\n\nJoe? And could you just state your name and firm for the webcast, please?\n\n---\n\nSure. Joe Ritchie, Goldman Sachs. Thanks, Matt. Inge, your team had a great year this year. And I guess, as I think about 2015, my biggest question, just broadly speaking, what are your biggest concerns either from a portfolio standpoint, your investments, your end markets? What are you concerned about at all as you head into '15?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think my concern is not so much the 3M operation as such, right? I think it's more a concern that will impact all of us, but maybe geopolitically relative to the evolution of economies, right? So I think that's the biggest thing that I'm thinking of and make sure that we are very careful and take a step-by-step execute our plan. And as I said to the team, is if things are changing, we need to be able to change very fast, right, as I said to the team. If you go to the forest with your map, and at the time, you see that the forest and the map does not connect, the forest is correct, throw away the map, and you need to be able to do that, right? I think that many companies go wrong because they still believe the map is correct, right, but it's not. So I think you have to just be careful as you move and make sure that you adapt or throw away your map if the landscape is changing and the forest is changing too much. Now I'd rather think about not only '15 but beyond '15 in terms of more opportunities for us, right? And I think that all the initiatives we are taking now around our supply chain is an opportunity for us as we move ahead. And I think when I think about levers, mid to long-term and also short-term, what we're doing in Switzerland and Singapore and Panama, that's a big opportunity for us. And I'm very excited about that opportunity, actually, because I think we should be able to be even more efficient on our inventory turns and the value of inventory and service level and so forth. So I think that's an opportunity for us. But the top of concern about operation, we have done a lot the last -- almost 3 years now in order to put the processes and the house in order for the future. So it's more a type of what will happen around the world, and we need to adjust to it, right? It's as simple as that.\n\n---\n\nAndrew?\n\n---\n\nYes, just to expand -- Andrew Obin, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Just to expand on your commentary, as I look at the efforts on portfolio management and prioritization, a, how far are you into these processes and how much is left? And it also seems -- if I look to your reduction in business units, it seems you've sort of done a lot of heavy lifting. So what's next in terms of evolution of the process at 3M?\n\n---\n\nI think, first of all, when you think about it -- and I think it's important to think about why did you end up in the situation at that time we had 40 businesses? 3M is built on and successfully built on entrepreneurship and empowerment. That also meant that the model along the many, many years evolved versus -- you try to separate out business in order to grow them faster. And in many markets, they are consolidating, and you need today to be more relevant. That was why we start to move those businesses together. So what's relevant for customer, efficiency in the processes. Every business today, the 27 business if you like, are now into the next step of challenging the portfolio or products that they are using. So I don't see there is major thing or more consolidation in between businesses, right? But we will address the last $450 million to $500 million that is symbolized by one bubble, and that will happen in each business as we move ahead. I think now it's more what I feel good about this, based on that work and the 4 fundamentals, we have a very -- we have a better picture and, I would say, a relatively good picture relative to the opportunities as we move ahead for expansion. But the expansion should be done both organically and maybe some acquisition that is close to our core, right? We know how to do it. We should take those fundamentals and build on it to drive value. That's what it is. If we not can drive value from 2.5 plus with those, we have to ask a question, why would we do it? So I think it's more around that, but I think we have done a lot of work, and we see the benefit coming seriously in terms of both productivity, as we've seen lately, a nice productivity in terms of less meetings back to processes, more efficiency, and then customers are -- see it's easier to interact with us.\n\n---\n\nSteve?\n\n---\n\nSteve Winoker, Bernstein. Just a question, Nick, maybe for you. Tremendous amount of detail in the presentation, still don't know what your margin target is necessarily for next year. But on my math, putting all that together, it looks to me like 60 to 100 basis points in margin expansion pre-FX and pension, and post FX and pension, more like flat to slightly down. Is that -- am I in the ballpark?\n\n---\n\nNot quite, Steve. We -- you're close to the ballpark, but I'll bring you into the ballpark.\n\n---\n\nExcellent, excellent.\n\n---\n\nWe expect margin expansion of approximately 50 basis points in 2015.\n\n---\n\nAnd that's all-in?\n\n---\n\nAll-in.\n\n---\n\nOkay, great. And then the other element to that is you often, in the past, have shown relative international penetration. So for every 3M product that's sold in the U.S., where are you in the rest of the world? And maybe this is for H.C., I'm not sure, but it used to be 60% roughly, and then over time, I think it was a little bit lower and it was calculated relative to GDP here versus rest of world. Can you maybe comment on where are you there? I won't hazard a guess on a number here because I don't need you to -- I'll rather just have you go for the clarification.\n\n---\n\nYes. So in most countries that we operate like in China, big countries in West Europe, our so-called self-efficiency, which means what percent of our revenue is represented by the product converted or manufactured locally is way over 65%. So the area -- there are a lot of products that are coming from the U.S. that are shifted out to local countries is pretty much gone. We developed more and more locally produce and converted products. So I don't have the exact figure for the question in the U.S., but we do increase the number of products and portions of locally manufactured products on a continued basis.\n\n---\n\nH.C. and Steve, help me out, I think you were talking about relative penetration in sales though, right?\n\n---\n\n[indiscernible]\n\n---\n\nYes, so say a few things...\n\n---\n\nSo if you look at the U.S., I think U.S. has 100. We generally have 45 on a global basis. It's a little high in countries like West Europe, in the range of 20, 25 in developing markets. So if you aggregate the whole thing, the number will be somewhere around in that range.\n\n---\n\nScott?\n\n---\n\nIt's Davis. We -- you addressed this a little bit, Inge, but we have kind of a tale of 2 different worlds right now. You've got the oil sellers and the oil buyers, and you do sell a fair amount into countries that are -- could be, if nothing else, literally civil war in the next 6 months if we have $50 oil. I mean, how do you -- do you have a plan B around cost? And when you think about places that -- whether it be Russia or Venezuela, Brazil, Mexico, places that you do have gross substantial revenues in that, do you have a cost plan of some semblance if we ran into some problems?\n\n---\n\nYes. First of all, we are always working on a contingency plan, if you like. And specifically, as you move into new year, it's almost like that is in place immediately. So yes, the answer is yes. I will say that coming back to the comments that H.C. did earlier in his presentation relative to action we are taking with prices et cetera, in order to manage what is going on locally, I think that's a strength for us in terms of being able to react immediately in countries if something is happening. And reality is it is happening, right? So we've done business for so many years outside of United States in many places in Central/East Europe and Middle East/Africa and Latin America and Asia that we know that always something will happen in one way or the other. In terms of Russia, our exposure in Russia is very small. It's -- and we made that calculation accordingly when things start to be a little bit more heated relative to Ukraine and Russia, and it's less than 1% of our sales revenue is there. We have a very few assets in Russia specifically. We have some manufacturing around respirators. We have some converting around Scotch-Brite product, and we have a pipeline coating facility, and the plan is not to expand, right? So I think as I said earlier in terms of concern, I think concern, generally speaking, if some geopolitical thing would start to move for us, we -- if you take Brazil, as you talked about, Venezuela we've gone through this year, I think Brazil is a very domestic-driven market by definition, right? So I think that's -- and we have a full operation in Brazil. And when I mean full operation, we have everything there from research and development to converting, manufacturing and commercialization. So they are very much self-sufficient in Brazil by definition. But as I said earlier, I think based on what is happening around the world, we are just moving piece by piece as we move forward. The important thing, though, in 3M's model is we adjust as things are happening, right? We never leave. It's very seldom we are leaving a country because things are going crazy temporarily, right? So we have always adjust and rightsized at the time and in order to keep connection with customers and officials, et cetera. So you can -- because that's coming, a time when it will bounce back, so you'd be ready to go then. I think that's an important element. I think the other thing that as we -- there has, of course, as we all know, been a slight adjustment in between growth and developed and developing world lately. And when we sit here, our expansion in the International over the last many years, it's important to know around that expansion we didn't leave our core. Our core is United States, if you like. We didn't leave United States and move somewhere. We moved in order to expand. And as we speak today, with U.S., a very attractive place to be, we feel very good because we have all the capabilities here in the United States, which is our home arena in a way, right? So I think it's a very good question, but it's you have to make sure that we are very careful as we roll out the plan, and we have a history of being able to do that, right, so...\n\n---\n\nExcuse me, Scott, I'll add one thing. In the case of Venezuela, over the last 2 years, we have been using our ability to take cash out of that country as the governor on the amount of business that we conduct there. That has resulted in a 3M exposure in Venezuela that is very small right now. So we're looking in a good position right now for Venezuela in light of where oil prices are.\n\n---\n\nUnderstood. As a follow-up on -- just to move to M&A, you did 2 completely different acquisitions in the last couple of years: Ceradyne, which we were essentially buying technology; and ACE, where you were buying a brand. What did you learn from the process there? Is it easier to buy a brand and -- like an ACE and bring it into your distribution and  such? Or is it better to buy the technology? Or is the answer both?\n\n---\n\nI don't know if one is easier than the other. I mean, you have all ways. There's different elements for you to implement. The easiest one is actually Sumitomo 3M, right? For those who run it, that's an -- you saw relative to [indiscernible] we're very attractive. So that's what you really would like to do. Now reality is you cannot find them in that way. I think that for our -- if you buy something that is based on brand equity, and with our capabilities to expand around the world, I think that's a model that will fit us very well. Now we have to understand that if that brand equity is strong, only 1 or 2 places geographic around the world, it takes a lot to expand it, I think, because the brand is in our minds, right, and often that's locally driven. So it's not so easy to take a brand that is very strong in West Europe, and just think that we can accelerate that in Latin America or in Asia or from U.S. to move somewhere else. Technology is, for us, is very interesting and important because we can leverage that many, many places. So I will say that it's not one that is easier than the other. But I think a technology play for us, done right as you see now with Ceradyne, is moving out to multiple divisions. And as we go out to multiple division and solutions, it will also go out to multiple geographical areas.\n\n---\n\nNigel?\n\n---\n\nNigel Coe from Morgan Stanley. A question for Nick. I want go back to the margin ballpark, 50 bps. Does that include any benefit from the hedged, the currency hedge you got in place? And then secondly, to what extent, if you'll -- how do you lay it in the lower price into your $0.15, $0.25 benefit from raw materials? Have you just taken current spot prices and rolled that forward? Or have you made some assumption on oil prices?\n\n---\n\nIn the case of the margin impact, that does include the hedge benefit that we're expecting in 2015 with the strong U.S. dollar. And how we factor in the $0.15 to $0.25 -- wait, which one are you referring to, Nigel?\n\n---\n\nYes, so the raw material tailwinds to margins. How do you factor in the lower price? Have you made an assumption on oil prices and how that impacts your input costs? Or have you just taken current input costs and rolled that forward? I mean, how do you lay that...\n\n---\n\nYes, we look at several things. We look at what's happened in the market and looking at current market prices and what the forward market is projecting for that. We look at what we see as 3M's capability to negotiate even better opportunities. And then the third component is where do we have the ability to swap in and out different raw materials to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities there. So it's not just a static, where is the spot market today, and it means this. It's a forward-looking view for us as we project that $0.15 to $0.25.\n\n---\n\nAnd then Inge, just a second question on the -- you gave us good color on the disruptive technologies. You said 30 projects underway, 15 moved into commercialization. How does that look in 2017? With R&D is 6% of sales, how many projects would you expect to have underway? And what kind of sales contribution would you expect by 2017?\n\n---\n\nYes. So first of all, that investment that we are doing from historical 5.5% to 6%, they are in disruptive technologies and market. Meaning, it would take longer time in order for us to commercialize them. And as I said earlier, you had days like a 7 smaller program that our early-stage commercialization and the sale is probably PCA, so around $100 million to $125 million. That will step up slightly as we move into next year, but I think we have to wait, longer-term, before we see the real, real benefit from it. And the reason why we changed it was that it became clear to us a couple of years ago that more risky programs around disruptive technologies was not really funded in the business as such, right, because we are driving them for a result quarter by quarter. So if it's a higher-risk, bigger investment, we maybe hold it back. So that's why we formed this innovation board internally in order to then allocate money that we can give back. But I would say, I'm very encouraged by the program we see moving forward. And as I said, that's around 30 programs in the pipeline. Now as it's always in the past, but the future is if you don't see opportunity, you have to kill them fast and go on to something else, right? But it looks good, and I see, we see -- I think you will see a small step-up in research and development as we go. Now as I put on that chart, research and development is important, but we also need productivity and outcome. So it's -- even if we are -- have a mere statement around investing innovation, it's the heartbeat of the company. We expect really good outcome on productivity. So they are not excluded from anything else as we are driving in the company in terms of productivity and so forth in the laboratory. But I would say that I am very pleased with the initiatives in the laboratory, generally speaking. And the other thing that is really strange for 3M is our manufacturing and our engineering capabilities, and that's part of the business model, if you like, right, and we don't talk so much about it generally speaking. We talk maybe more about research and development, the 5.5%, or so. But also, investment in manufacturing capability and advanced engineering is very important for our business model. So very little outsourcing, right? That's not our model because it's quite advanced product that we are producing, generally speaking.\n\n---\n\nMartin?\n\n---\n\nMartin Sankey, Neuberger Berman. Nick, during your presentation you mentioned the company's new product vitality index and that it is an important metric that is closely monitored. That number, I believe, has stayed about 32%, 33% in recent years versus a couple of years ago the company wanted to be on a path to be at 40% by the 2016, 2017 time frame. Could you provide us some perspectives as to why that has happened? Or is that something that the company is satisfied with? Or has there been some changes in the dynamics of how you're approaching the new products such that the number might be a little bit harder to obtain growth because you are focused more on breakthrough products as opposed to product line extensions?\n\n---\n\nMaybe I can address that. So NPVI, new product vitality index, was introduced many years ago. And just so we're all in the same page, it's a measurement of products sold today that was not introduced 5 years ago. So it's an important metric. We found out, when it was introduced, that our pipeline of new product was maybe not as robust as we would like. So we did 2 things back then. One, we put out a target of 40% NPVI, and we started, if you recall, to make many small acquisitions in order to complement the product portfolio. That second piece was a result of that we didn't see a lot of new product coming through. So when we shoot out 40%, it was like to get attention and start to move it. And we moved it probably from 18%, 19% up, above 30%, 33%, 34%. I think it's 33%,  yes? Now important to know with NPVI, that's the secondary metric. It's the secondary metric; it's not the primary metric. The primary metric is organic local currency growth. So NPVI is supporting organic local currency growth. And as you talk about 4% to 6% organic local currency growth, NPVI will help you to drive that. Now the other thing that is happening, if you're not successful of commercializing those product in NPVI and you are coming closer to 40 or more, those product will end up in your inventory. So you have then to say, okay, what is the optimal position for NPVI? We moved that down from 40% to 37% or something last year or the year before. So we talked about 37%. There's no science to 37%, there's no science. You will not live or die by 37%. You will live and die with organic local currency growth that is 4% to 6%. So I think that's an important element. So the way it's -- so why is NPVI important? Well, it's not important to compensate people or drive them after only that metric, but it's important because if you have an erosion in your business of 5%, 5% by 5% is 25%, if you don't have an NPVI of at least 25%, you're standing still and eventually losing. So that's one important element. The other thing is with a robust NPVI pipeline, you'll get more time with customers. And it's an important element in terms of you being relevant in front of your customers. So we are talking about 35%, 37% or something like that, but think about it as a secondary metric for the company. You should think about 4% to 6% organic local currency growth because I wouldn't like to have a business that have 52% NPVI but are declining. That's an issue. So it's important to understand the metric as such.\n\n---\n\nIt's Reggie [ph] coming from Oppenheimer. I would have come back to the NPVI and the economic implications of it because it is a function of the successful commercialization of R&D spend. And so the effectiveness of R&D and the productivity of R&D is demonstrated, to some extent, by NPVI. Could you describe a little bit about the economic characteristics of NPVI index components and the implications for margin as well as return on capital employed of that dynamic?\n\n---\n\nYes, I'll take that. You heard everyone of us today talk about the 4 fundamental strengths and how we are -- our analysis has shown those 4 fundamental strengths are enhancing our operating margins and our return on invested capital, innovation being the first one listed there. Our ability to innovate, to create customer relevance with our customers, to be able to price products for the value that it's creating for those customers, that's part of the operating margin, but it's also a big contributor to our ability to grow organically sometime during that 5-year time horizon. But as Mike talked about in his presentation, part of that growth is also coming after that 5-year time horizon as we continue to commercialize what we've already introduced. So we see our investment in the success of our innovation, investment in innovation, has been enhancing both our margin and our ability to grow organically. For us, it's not one or the other.\n\n---\n\nDoes that mean the components of the NPVI have higher margin than the rest of the portfolio? Or is there no connection?\n\n---\n\nI would be making too much of a sweeping generalization to say that one -- that component has a higher or lower operating margin than others. The fact that it's there and continually refreshing our portfolio allows us, we believe, to have an overall portfolio that has, to an extent, enhanced operating income margin. Often in the first 1 or 2 years of a product introduction launch, we face higher up-front costs in getting it launched. So in that first 1 or 2 years, likely no. But over the life cycle of that product, it definitely is enhancing our operating income margin.\n\n---\n\nSteve?\n\n---\n\nSteve Tusa from JPMorgan. Can you just maybe talk about the fourth quarter a bit? Are there any puts and takes within the segments? And I assume you're just eating this restructuring, and is that part of the range? Or is there something that's offsetting that?\n\n---\n\nThe things that I described when I'm saying what we're seeing as we come to the end of this year are encompassed in the range that we have put out for the total year expectation.\n\n---\n\nAnd then just on the longer-term target of 4% to 6%, so you did, I think, about 3.5% in '13. You're going to do somewhere in the range of low 4s or maybe mid-4s, 4.5% this year. Next year, you're kind of at 3% to 6%. So what gets better to get you to the high end of that range on the 4% to 6% organic? I think the EPS target has been very well-delivered upon with some balance sheet -- extra balance sheet utilization. But I guess, the core growth, what gets better? Is that something you guys control? Or is that more of a macro call?\n\n---\n\nI think it's -- there's 2 elements to it. So when we talk about -- so 4% and 6% for the plan and then 3% to 6% going into next year. The 3% there is a type of a little bit of uncertainty as we talked about in the economy. But what will it take for us in order to move up versus the top of that range? First of all, what we feel good about, but I -- and we hope that it could be sustainable, is what we have done in United States relative to our execution model on commercialization. As you recall, we took a hard look at that starting 2011 by focusing the U.S. businesses to focus only execution in the United States. That started to pay off for us, and the economy is improving. So when you have seen in the last couple of quarters an improved growth rate in United States, that need to continue. We also need to see that we can capitalize on the evolution of the economy in China that is not going from export to domestic, this type of addition to domestic. So we need to be able to commercialize on that and capitalize it, and China need to do slightly better than we see at this point in time. And then West Europe, I think, as H.C. rightly described it, is a slow-growing environment, but there are opportunities there. So I would say to go in the higher end of it, our plan -- we are confident that we can execute on that in U.S. now as it stands. So we hope the economy stands up. And then with China and West Europe, the top is ticking up a little bit. I think we are coming closer over time. It's not only gut feeling. I think that Nick showed the 1.7x IPI, it is clear that as we laid out the plan that we see better momentum in our ability to execute from a commercialization perspective. So I feel encouraged, I would say, with the ability. So I think it's -- we are well set, and I hope that the economy is becoming slightly better in West Europe and China. And I think we need that all in order to move it close or up on the high end of the range.\n\n---\n\nAnd then just one last question, just on the margin. I guess, price raws for you guys, you've done a great job of managing that. Obviously, you're going to have a big benefit in 2015. I'm a little bit surprised that you said slightly positive price. I mean, you guys have been getting a decent amount of price, whether it's driven by foreign exchange or just blocking and tackling. If -- is that kind of the run rate we should consider now on year-over-year price with your commodities down that you're maybe giving a little bit of that back to go for volume? And then the second question is, obviously impressive, you guys are now expanding margins. Why not give a longer-term margin target? Is that something that you could add to that 2017 chart at some stage of the game now that you're kind of on the horse there?\n\n---\n\nA couple of things. On the margin expansion and the price for raw materials and why not even more price in 2015, one thing I did omit earlier: Part of our ability to drive price is part of the very innovation that we've been talking about in several of the Q&A. That has been and continues to be a driver of our price growth. One reason we're not going even further with our price growth in the 2015 is the commodity price issues that I've been talking about that will be a headwind for us on our ability on price. Once I go out beyond 2015, I do not expect -- I don't think we have enough visibility of what's happening with FX and what's happening with commodities to be making a statement about price growth going further than that, other than that what I started with our ability to innovate and what that does for our ability to drive price in the market. As far as a longer-term view, as part of our plan, when we introduced our plan for earnings per share growth, part of our plan was there were many drivers that can help us get to that 9% to 11%. To the extent that we see something's not contributing to what we expected, we may have margin as an opportunity in there for ways we can deliver that 9% to 11%. But right now, we're not seeing the need to -- we continue to see the need to keep reinvesting in our business. And for that reason, I don't think it would be wise for us to be putting an, even further out, margin target. If Inge and I or all of us up here really needed and wanted to drive up the margin in the short term, that's always a possibility, by cutting costs and doing other things. But I don't think in the long term, it would be something you the investors would be happy with because we'd be sacrificing many of the things that are driving our ability to grow organically over time.\n\n---\n\nI think one thing that has been important for us is also to build a credible plan that you can follow and believe we can deliver on. And I think as we laid that out early on, there's certain things that we will like to do, which was reinvestment, et cetera and we wouldn't like, at this point in time at least, to overpromise anything on the margin side. I will say that I am encouraged with the productivity we start to see in the plan as we speak. But do we have still some work to do on the strategic investment? And some are very offensive business transformation. We will do it that we'll have incredible benefit for all of us as we go ahead. And then we have some small cleanups here in there that we try to do as well. So we just try to stay on the safe side and not overpromise and under-deliver. I think that's the motto here.\n\n---\n\nJeff? Right here.\n\n---\n\nJeff Sprecher, Vertical Research. One for Inge and then just one for Nick. Inge, just back on the portfolio, to some of the earlier questions, if we think about those businesses that were not in Strategic Review and not in Heartland and not in Push Forward and therefore kind of in transition, so to speak, that's about $8 billion of revenue, it looks like. So I guess, it's a little unclear to me how they move out of transition, what actually changes significantly enough to alter where they sit on that map is really kind of the first question. And do we think about it's a margin improvement story or it's cash or some other kind of outcome for those businesses?\n\n---\n\nYes, think about it in like many of those businesses that was categorized like in transition, some of them have been combined in one way or the other in order to drive efficiency and relevance to customers. So it was many of them that was certainly, yes, was in transition because we have not -- I would say, we have not been smart enough to really consolidate the benefit that they could do together. And in fact, I think there was even one business that was in Strategic Review that actually came out of that and moved forward relative to benefit by recombining with 2 businesses in transition. So I think we have done a lot of things for them, and I would say, they will not move into Heartland as I see it. They're coming closer to Push Forward as we go ahead. When you run an enterprise like this with 90,000 people and many, many businesses, I think the important thing is that there is a process in order, really, to help with the business plan in terms of direction going forward. That is what we try to do. So that's why I would say that in the end of 2015, there will not be a category called in transition, right? It's now your responsibility leading a business and ours to develop the plan of what this is all about as we move ahead. You need to do it as a first step, as I've done based on a couple of places before, inside in different geographical areas of 3M. The first is almost a shock for the organization when we start to categorize them, right? You get a lot of attention, I can tell you that, and progress start to happen, right? So a lot of them have been addressed, and -- but I don't see, at this point in time, that some of them will move into Heartland by definition. I think they're more apt to more growth in Push Forward.\n\n---\n\nJust wondering, just as a follow-up for Nick on kind of the capital deployment strategy and plan. Could you just kind of maybe back to kind of the ballpark analogy kind of bring us up-to-date on where you sit relative to the rating agencies, relative to how perhaps you're trying to manage the rating? Your ability to flex, and I kind of asked that question maybe more in the context if your entire 5-year M&A ambition happened to materialize in 2015 because these things are just episodic. Could you, in fact, do that? How would you toggle back and forth? Just frame that for us.\n\n---\n\nWhen you think about our total 5-year capital allocation strategy, right now, we're at a low AA rate debt rating. And our 5-year strategy with the share buybacks, with the M&A, with the other investments that we've talked about there, with the added leverage, we have the capability to stay at a low AA and accomplish all of those things and still with some degrees of freedom within that. It's not pushing it to the very edge. So Jeff, I hope that's answering your question there.\n\n---\n\nWe've got time for 2 more. So Deane?\n\n---\n\nIt's Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Just to go back to the questions regarding the implications of all the investment in new products and disruptive technologies, I'd be interested in hearing, either philosophically or to the P&L, how you address product cannibalization. I think at the end, it all gets netted in your organic local currency growth. But just what's your tolerance? And how do you manage product cannibalization?\n\n---\n\nYes, we categorize new products in 3 different categories. So for simplification, let's call them A, B and C. A is where we basically introduce -- well we cannibalize ourself. That's what we do in A. In B is where we develop new products into current channels and current customers. And then C is the disruptive technology. So when you look upon the facts and data, we are very good in category A. We know how to do that constantly. That's fantastic machine, people are on it the whole time, and as you know, it's better to do it to yourself than someone else to do it, right? So that is doing very well. We are also pretty good in category B, which is new product to current channels and customers. It's a very effective, productive way of introduce and expand. And then the challenge we have was in the last category C, where we make those investments as we move ahead. And when we looked upon it, it's like in the 2 first categories, most of our growth came there, right? And it's typological when you think about it because disruptive technology, as I said earlier, is more difficult to go on when you need to stay on course to deliver every quarter and every year, right? So you chip away and you hold off, et cetera. So think about them in those 3 categories. We call them 3, 4 and 5 internally, but you have to simplify them in that way. And so you would like to get -- for me, you need to first-class where you cannibalize yourself. That's a must. You do it the whole time. The very effective way is the second class, right, where you are able to utilize your connections with a channel of customers and introduce new product, so a very -- so we do -- we put a lot of focus actually now on that category to see how can we boost that even more, right? So Ashish Khandpur is our new CTO, is driving that with additional emphasis into our businesses.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Last question, Dave Begleiter.\n\n---\n\nDave Begleiter, Deutsche Bank. Nick, one more time on raws. What is your -- where are your Brent and WTI forecast for 2015? And what is your earnings sensitivity to a $10 change in oil prices in 2015?\n\n---\n\nThe $0.15 to $0.25 earnings per share impact from raw materials is built around an assumption of oil prices being between $60 and $70 a barrel. And then the second part, sensitivity, a $10 move in oil prices, I'm doing the math as I think here, probably, $0.02. About $0.02, David.\n\n---\n\nOkay. All right. Well, thanks for coming. It was a great day. Appreciate your attention very much. And if you have follow-ups, please let us know. Thanks.\n\n---\n\nThank you.",
      "transcript_text4": "【回答: Matt Ginter (Executives)】\nOkay. I think we're just rounding up H.C. He should be here in a minute. We're going to get started.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Inge Thulin (Executives)】\nYes, let's start.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Matt Ginter (Executives)】\nMaybe we could start. He'll be here in just a second. Go ahead, Cliff.\r\nThe mic attendant's right here.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Cliff Ransom (Analysts)】\nIt's Cliff Ransom. I guess, this question is for Nick, but if any of the operating heads want to speak to it. You seem to talk about Lean Six Sigma as a short-term cost. My experience is that's pretty much of a pay-as-you-go metric, pay-as-you-go process. And then number two, I'm struck that when you talk about investing in Lean Six Sigma, you talked about the number of black belts. How would you respond to the thought that, that's the wrong metric? The metric is the one that your customers see, which is quality, delivery, cost, innovation and safety?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nicholas Gangestad (Executives)】\nA few things and then others can chime in after me. We see our investments in Lean Six Sigma as just that, an investment. It happens to be one that gets very fast payback. As you can see by the graph that I was showing of the financial returns that we were generating, that most of our black belts that we put into Lean Six Sigma are generating returns that more than pay their salary the very first year they're in place. In terms of the part of the question on short-term versus long-term, part of what -- where we're going with Lean in 3M is how do we use Lean to redesign our supply chains in order to make our efficiency and effectiveness with our customers even better. And that's where we design processes that are focused on what's the most value-adding to our customers and taking out parts of the process that are not adding value to our customers. So especially in the Lean portion of Lean Six Sigma, we see relevance for that. The Six Sigma portion is largely directed at how do you take defects out of the process, defects that add cost or defects that can take away from the customer experience.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Inge Thulin (Executives)】\nThere is a direct correlation, of course, in between the belt and the output, right? And I wouldn't like you to come across with the message that we are a company that are insular relative to look upon things we do internally only for the internal thing. Of course, everything we do has and should have a benefit for the customers. But in terms of Six Sigma, Mike Roman, as he's leading our biggest business -- maybe you, Mike, can make some comments relative to number of belts and the value for each and sort of how we do that in 1/3 of the company after we get the feeling for. So it's a good question actually around Lean Six Sigma.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Roman (Executives)】\nYes, I think the way what Inge said it is right: it's correlated with the number of black belts, but it goes well beyond black belts. We have a green belt army that helps to deploy Lean Six Sigma projects, and we have Lean managers that are part of that deployment. But the black belts are an important leadership component of our Lean Six Sigma model. They are the ones out there, at a plant level, at an operational level, really marshaling the forces and really driving a Lean Six Sigma focus. We call it a Wave 1 intensity kind of focus for us in our Industrial business. So it is much more than the Black Belts, but that's an important element of that. We really want to focus on making sure we have that leadership around the world, really. And I would say, as Nick said, it's -- we get a very short-term return on that, but it has a long-term impact on our enterprise. And we're seeing 20%-plus of our savings now coming from Lean implementation, and that's a long-term payback. I mean, that continues to pay dividends for years to come.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Inge Thulin (Executives)】\nI think also, yes, and we actually would like to talk about it for a second because it's an important element of the efficiency. So as you'll recall, there was a time in 3M where Six Sigma was embedded in many, many things starting back maybe in 2002 or something, went for 5, 6 years. Then came a period where maybe, if you like to use it, please go ahead and use it as a tool. You also see on the ramp-up, we are revitalizing Lean Six Sigma into the company, and it will stay there as we move forward, specifically in manufacturing and supply chain. And that's why I feel very encouraged relative to the momentum that is there now. I think everyone in 3M understand the benefit from it and all the focus we are putting on it. And we are a company, as you know, when we put emphasis from the center of the company in terms of initiative, we get it done, right? So I'm very encouraged in terms of what will happen in the next many years to come, right, so...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Matt Ginter (Executives)】\nNext question. Ajay?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ajay Kejriwal (Analysts)】\nSo Inge, on one of your charts, you had the various divisions and you had 3 circles around the Heartland, Push Forward and the one Strategic Review, but there were some businesses that were outside those circles. Maybe just talk about how we should think about those businesses. Are those like cash cows? Or could they move to one of those circles over time?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Inge Thulin (Executives)】\nYes, yes. So think about in this where -- when we started the journey, the first evaluation we did was to understand the value strategically and financially for the company and which business had more opportunity and, also specifically, which businesses have lagged the company for the last 5 years. We identified them under Strategic Review. The step that we call it in transition was businesses that, I would say, still had opportunity. But at least in my mind, our plan was not really clear, not really clear. Now if you think about that in terms of how we have addressed businesses under Strategic Review, which went from $2.5 billion to it's less than $500 million as we speak -- and by the way, that bubble is a collection of smaller businesses, right? So it's not one big business. It is small things that all the business groups now are addressing. Almost 3 years into the plan, you are not any longer in transition. You will have, by the end of this year moving into next year, a plan of where you are going. So I would say, you're not allowed in 3M to be a business under transition for that long time. The question at that point for me was: So what is the plan? We need to develop the plan together and make sure you'll get the resources you need or we have to do something else. So I think that was, I would say, was not the burning platform at all, if you were in transition. It was just like we need collectively to develop a plan, so you should not be in transition as you move ahead, right? You are -- and as I said, portfolio management is not the project; that's a process. So people will go in and out relative to what you need to have helped with. And my view of 3M, as we move ahead, when we started, if you got the information, you are under Strategic Review, that sounds bad, and it was maybe not the best place to be. When we move forward, if we're under Strategic Review, that's an opportunity. That's a Strategic Review based on an offensive mode, what can we do better in order to move forward. So that's my view on it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ajay Kejriwal (Analysts)】\nJust one more, if I can sneak in. On pricing and in your model, you had pricing up next year. So maybe just big picture with the raw material environment kind of being benign, does that kind of limit your pricing opportunity next year? Or given that a lot of your products are consumable type and a lot of what you do is ban-driven, could you continue to get good pricing despite the weak raw material environment?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nicholas Gangestad (Executives)】\nYes, there's multiple factors impacting pricing, exactly what you were talking about commodity prices having an impact on our ability to raise prices. Offsetting that is what's happening in the foreign exchange market. As many of you have probably heard me talk about before, especially in developing parts of the world, we often have the ability to adjust pricing to offset what's happening with FX, and that will be a positive impact on pricing in 2015.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Matt Ginter (Executives)】\nJoe? And could you just state your name and firm for the webcast, please?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Joseph Ritchie (Analysts)】\nSure. Joe Ritchie, Goldman Sachs. Thanks, Matt. Inge, your team had a great year this year. And I guess, as I think about 2015, my biggest question, just broadly speaking, what are your biggest concerns either from a portfolio standpoint, your investments, your end markets? What are you concerned about at all as you head into '15?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Inge Thulin (Executives)】\nYes, I think my concern is not so much the 3M operation as such, right? I think it's more a concern that will impact all of us, but maybe geopolitically relative to the evolution of economies, right? So I think that's the biggest thing that I'm thinking of and make sure that we are very careful and take a step-by-step execute our plan. And as I said to the team, is if things are changing, we need to be able to change very fast, right, as I said to the team. If you go to the forest with your map, and at the time, you see that the forest and the map does not connect, the forest is correct, throw away the map, and you need to be able to do that, right? I think that many companies go wrong because they still believe the map is correct, right, but it's not. So I think you have to just be careful as you move and make sure that you adapt or throw away your map if the landscape is changing and the forest is changing too much. Now I'd rather think about not only '15 but beyond '15 in terms of more opportunities for us, right? And I think that all the initiatives we are taking now around our supply chain is an opportunity for us as we move ahead. And I think when I think about levers, mid to long-term and also short-term, what we're doing in Switzerland and Singapore and Panama, that's a big opportunity for us. And I'm very excited about that opportunity, actually, because I think we should be able to be even more efficient on our inventory turns and the value of inventory and service level and so forth. So I think that's an opportunity for us. But the top of concern about operation, we have done a lot the last -- almost 3 years now in order to put the processes and the house in order for the future. So it's more a type of what will happen around the world, and we need to adjust to it, right? It's as simple as that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Matt Ginter (Executives)】\nAndrew?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Obin (Analysts)】\nYes, just to expand -- Andrew Obin, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Just to expand on your commentary, as I look at the efforts on portfolio management and prioritization, a, how far are you into these processes and how much is left? And it also seems -- if I look to your reduction in business units, it seems you've sort of done a lot of heavy lifting. So what's next in terms of evolution of the process at 3M?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Inge Thulin (Executives)】\nI think, first of all, when you think about it -- and I think it's important to think about why did you end up in the situation at that time we had 40 businesses? 3M is built on and successfully built on entrepreneurship and empowerment. That also meant that the model along the many, many years evolved versus -- you try to separate out business in order to grow them faster. And in many markets, they are consolidating, and you need today to be more relevant. That was why we start to move those businesses together. So what's relevant for customer, efficiency in the processes. Every business today, the 27 business if you like, are now into the next step of challenging the portfolio or products that they are using. So I don't see there is major thing or more consolidation in between businesses, right? But we will address the last $450 million to $500 million that is symbolized by one bubble, and that will happen in each business as we move ahead. I think now it's more what I feel good about this, based on that work and the 4 fundamentals, we have a very -- we have a better picture and, I would say, a relatively good picture relative to the opportunities as we move ahead for expansion. But the expansion should be done both organically and maybe some acquisition that is close to our core, right? We know how to do it. We should take those fundamentals and build on it to drive value. That's what it is. If we not can drive value from 2.5 plus with those, we have to ask a question, why would we do it? So I think it's more around that, but I think we have done a lot of work, and we see the benefit coming seriously in terms of both productivity, as we've seen lately, a nice productivity in terms of less meetings back to processes, more efficiency, and then customers are -- see it's easier to interact with us.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Matt Ginter (Executives)】\nSteve?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Steven Winoker (Analysts)】\nSteve Winoker, Bernstein. Just a question, Nick, maybe for you. Tremendous amount of detail in the presentation, still don't know what your margin target is necessarily for next year. But on my math, putting all that together, it looks to me like 60 to 100 basis points in margin expansion pre-FX and pension, and post FX and pension, more like flat to slightly down. Is that -- am I in the ballpark?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nicholas Gangestad (Executives)】\nNot quite, Steve. We -- you're close to the ballpark, but I'll bring you into the ballpark.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Steven Winoker (Analysts)】\nExcellent, excellent.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nicholas Gangestad (Executives)】\nWe expect margin expansion of approximately 50 basis points in 2015.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Steven Winoker (Analysts)】\nAnd that's all-in?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nicholas Gangestad (Executives)】\nAll-in.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Steven Winoker (Analysts)】\nOkay, great. And then the other element to that is you often, in the past, have shown relative international penetration. So for every 3M product that's sold in the U.S., where are you in the rest of the world? And maybe this is for H.C., I'm not sure, but it used to be 60% roughly, and then over time, I think it was a little bit lower and it was calculated relative to GDP here versus rest of world. Can you maybe comment on where are you there? I won't hazard a guess on a number here because I don't need you to -- I'll rather just have you go for the clarification.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hak Shin (Executives)】\nYes. So in most countries that we operate like in China, big countries in West Europe, our so-called self-efficiency, which means what percent of our revenue is represented by the product converted or manufactured locally is way over 65%. So the area -- there are a lot of products that are coming from the U.S. that are shifted out to local countries is pretty much gone. We developed more and more locally produce and converted products. So I don't have the exact figure for the question in the U.S., but we do increase the number of products and portions of locally manufactured products on a continued basis.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nicholas Gangestad (Executives)】\nH.C. and Steve, help me out, I think you were talking about relative penetration in sales though, right?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hak Shin (Executives)】\n[indiscernible]\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nicholas Gangestad (Executives)】\nYes, so say a few things...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hak Shin (Executives)】\nSo if you look at the U.S., I think U.S. has 100. We generally have 45 on a global basis. It's a little high in countries like West Europe, in the range of 20, 25 in developing markets. So if you aggregate the whole thing, the number will be somewhere around in that range.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Matt Ginter (Executives)】\nScott?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Davis (Analysts)】\nIt's Davis. We -- you addressed this a little bit, Inge, but we have kind of a tale of 2 different worlds right now. You've got the oil sellers and the oil buyers, and you do sell a fair amount into countries that are -- could be, if nothing else, literally civil war in the next 6 months if we have $50 oil. I mean, how do you -- do you have a plan B around cost? And when you think about places that -- whether it be Russia or Venezuela, Brazil, Mexico, places that you do have gross substantial revenues in that, do you have a cost plan of some semblance if we ran into some problems?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Inge Thulin (Executives)】\nYes. First of all, we are always working on a contingency plan, if you like. And specifically, as you move into new year, it's almost like that is in place immediately. So yes, the answer is yes. I will say that coming back to the comments that H.C. did earlier in his presentation relative to action we are taking with prices et cetera, in order to manage what is going on locally, I think that's a strength for us in terms of being able to react immediately in countries if something is happening. And reality is it is happening, right? So we've done business for so many years outside of United States in many places in Central/East Europe and Middle East/Africa and Latin America and Asia that we know that always something will happen in one way or the other. In terms of Russia, our exposure in Russia is very small. It's -- and we made that calculation accordingly when things start to be a little bit more heated relative to Ukraine and Russia, and it's less than 1% of our sales revenue is there. We have a very few assets in Russia specifically. We have some manufacturing around respirators. We have some converting around Scotch-Brite product, and we have a pipeline coating facility, and the plan is not to expand, right? So I think as I said earlier in terms of concern, I think concern, generally speaking, if some geopolitical thing would start to move for us, we -- if you take Brazil, as you talked about, Venezuela we've gone through this year, I think Brazil is a very domestic-driven market by definition, right? So I think that's -- and we have a full operation in Brazil. And when I mean full operation, we have everything there from research and development to converting, manufacturing and commercialization. So they are very much self-sufficient in Brazil by definition. But as I said earlier, I think based on what is happening around the world, we are just moving piece by piece as we move forward. The important thing, though, in 3M's model is we adjust as things are happening, right? We never leave. It's very seldom we are leaving a country because things are going crazy temporarily, right? So we have always adjust and rightsized at the time and in order to keep connection with customers and officials, et cetera. So you can -- because that's coming, a time when it will bounce back, so you'd be ready to go then. I think that's an important element. I think the other thing that as we -- there has, of course, as we all know, been a slight adjustment in between growth and developed and developing world lately. And when we sit here, our expansion in the International over the last many years, it's important to know around that expansion we didn't leave our core. Our core is United States, if you like. We didn't leave United States and move somewhere. We moved in order to expand. And as we speak today, with U.S., a very attractive place to be, we feel very good because we have all the capabilities here in the United States, which is our home arena in a way, right? So I think it's a very good question, but it's you have to make sure that we are very careful as we roll out the plan, and we have a history of being able to do that, right, so...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nicholas Gangestad (Executives)】\nExcuse me, Scott, I'll add one thing. In the case of Venezuela, over the last 2 years, we have been using our ability to take cash out of that country as the governor on the amount of business that we conduct there. That has resulted in a 3M exposure in Venezuela that is very small right now. So we're looking in a good position right now for Venezuela in light of where oil prices are.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Davis (Analysts)】\nUnderstood. As a follow-up on -- just to move to M&A, you did 2 completely different acquisitions in the last couple of years: Ceradyne, which we were essentially buying technology; and ACE, where you were buying a brand. What did you learn from the process there? Is it easier to buy a brand and -- like an ACE and bring it into your distribution and  such? Or is it better to buy the technology? Or is the answer both?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Inge Thulin (Executives)】\nI don't know if one is easier than the other. I mean, you have all ways. There's different elements for you to implement. The easiest one is actually Sumitomo 3M, right? For those who run it, that's an -- you saw relative to [indiscernible] we're very attractive. So that's what you really would like to do. Now reality is you cannot find them in that way. I think that for our -- if you buy something that is based on brand equity, and with our capabilities to expand around the world, I think that's a model that will fit us very well. Now we have to understand that if that brand equity is strong, only 1 or 2 places geographic around the world, it takes a lot to expand it, I think, because the brand is in our minds, right, and often that's locally driven. So it's not so easy to take a brand that is very strong in West Europe, and just think that we can accelerate that in Latin America or in Asia or from U.S. to move somewhere else. Technology is, for us, is very interesting and important because we can leverage that many, many places. So I will say that it's not one that is easier than the other. But I think a technology play for us, done right as you see now with Ceradyne, is moving out to multiple divisions. And as we go out to multiple division and solutions, it will also go out to multiple geographical areas.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Matt Ginter (Executives)】\nNigel?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Nigel Coe (Analysts)】\nNigel Coe from Morgan Stanley. A question for Nick. I want go back to the margin ballpark, 50 bps. Does that include any benefit from the hedged, the currency hedge you got in place? And then secondly, to what extent, if you'll -- how do you lay it in the lower price into your $0.15, $0.25 benefit from raw materials? Have you just taken current spot prices and rolled that forward? Or have you made some assumption on oil prices?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nicholas Gangestad (Executives)】\nIn the case of the margin impact, that does include the hedge benefit that we're expecting in 2015 with the strong U.S. dollar. And how we factor in the $0.15 to $0.25 -- wait, which one are you referring to, Nigel?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Nigel Coe (Analysts)】\nYes, so the raw material tailwinds to margins. How do you factor in the lower price? Have you made an assumption on oil prices and how that impacts your input costs? Or have you just taken current input costs and rolled that forward? I mean, how do you lay that...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nicholas Gangestad (Executives)】\nYes, we look at several things. We look at what's happened in the market and looking at current market prices and what the forward market is projecting for that. We look at what we see as 3M's capability to negotiate even better opportunities. And then the third component is where do we have the ability to swap in and out different raw materials to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities there. So it's not just a static, where is the spot market today, and it means this. It's a forward-looking view for us as we project that $0.15 to $0.25.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Nigel Coe (Analysts)】\nAnd then Inge, just a second question on the -- you gave us good color on the disruptive technologies. You said 30 projects underway, 15 moved into commercialization. How does that look in 2017? With R&D is 6% of sales, how many projects would you expect to have underway? And what kind of sales contribution would you expect by 2017?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Inge Thulin (Executives)】\nYes. So first of all, that investment that we are doing from historical 5.5% to 6%, they are in disruptive technologies and market. Meaning, it would take longer time in order for us to commercialize them. And as I said earlier, you had days like a 7 smaller program that our early-stage commercialization and the sale is probably PCA, so around $100 million to $125 million. That will step up slightly as we move into next year, but I think we have to wait, longer-term, before we see the real, real benefit from it. And the reason why we changed it was that it became clear to us a couple of years ago that more risky programs around disruptive technologies was not really funded in the business as such, right, because we are driving them for a result quarter by quarter. So if it's a higher-risk, bigger investment, we maybe hold it back. So that's why we formed this innovation board internally in order to then allocate money that we can give back. But I would say, I'm very encouraged by the program we see moving forward. And as I said, that's around 30 programs in the pipeline. Now as it's always in the past, but the future is if you don't see opportunity, you have to kill them fast and go on to something else, right? But it looks good, and I see, we see -- I think you will see a small step-up in research and development as we go. Now as I put on that chart, research and development is important, but we also need productivity and outcome. So it's -- even if we are -- have a mere statement around investing innovation, it's the heartbeat of the company. We expect really good outcome on productivity. So they are not excluded from anything else as we are driving in the company in terms of productivity and so forth in the laboratory. But I would say that I am very pleased with the initiatives in the laboratory, generally speaking. And the other thing that is really strange for 3M is our manufacturing and our engineering capabilities, and that's part of the business model, if you like, right, and we don't talk so much about it generally speaking. We talk maybe more about research and development, the 5.5%, or so. But also, investment in manufacturing capability and advanced engineering is very important for our business model. So very little outsourcing, right? That's not our model because it's quite advanced product that we are producing, generally speaking.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Matt Ginter (Executives)】\nMartin?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Martin Sankey (Analysts)】\nMartin Sankey, Neuberger Berman. Nick, during your presentation you mentioned the company's new product vitality index and that it is an important metric that is closely monitored. That number, I believe, has stayed about 32%, 33% in recent years versus a couple of years ago the company wanted to be on a path to be at 40% by the 2016, 2017 time frame. Could you provide us some perspectives as to why that has happened? Or is that something that the company is satisfied with? Or has there been some changes in the dynamics of how you're approaching the new products such that the number might be a little bit harder to obtain growth because you are focused more on breakthrough products as opposed to product line extensions?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Inge Thulin (Executives)】\nMaybe I can address that. So NPVI, new product vitality index, was introduced many years ago. And just so we're all in the same page, it's a measurement of products sold today that was not introduced 5 years ago. So it's an important metric. We found out, when it was introduced, that our pipeline of new product was maybe not as robust as we would like. So we did 2 things back then. One, we put out a target of 40% NPVI, and we started, if you recall, to make many small acquisitions in order to complement the product portfolio. That second piece was a result of that we didn't see a lot of new product coming through. So when we shoot out 40%, it was like to get attention and start to move it. And we moved it probably from 18%, 19% up, above 30%, 33%, 34%. I think it's 33%,  yes? Now important to know with NPVI, that's the secondary metric. It's the secondary metric; it's not the primary metric. The primary metric is organic local currency growth. So NPVI is supporting organic local currency growth. And as you talk about 4% to 6% organic local currency growth, NPVI will help you to drive that. Now the other thing that is happening, if you're not successful of commercializing those product in NPVI and you are coming closer to 40 or more, those product will end up in your inventory. So you have then to say, okay, what is the optimal position for NPVI? We moved that down from 40% to 37% or something last year or the year before. So we talked about 37%. There's no science to 37%, there's no science. You will not live or die by 37%. You will live and die with organic local currency growth that is 4% to 6%. So I think that's an important element. So the way it's -- so why is NPVI important? Well, it's not important to compensate people or drive them after only that metric, but it's important because if you have an erosion in your business of 5%, 5% by 5% is 25%, if you don't have an NPVI of at least 25%, you're standing still and eventually losing. So that's one important element. The other thing is with a robust NPVI pipeline, you'll get more time with customers. And it's an important element in terms of you being relevant in front of your customers. So we are talking about 35%, 37% or something like that, but think about it as a secondary metric for the company. You should think about 4% to 6% organic local currency growth because I wouldn't like to have a business that have 52% NPVI but are declining. That's an issue. So it's important to understand the metric as such.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Attendee (Attendees)】\nIt's Reggie [ph] coming from Oppenheimer. I would have come back to the NPVI and the economic implications of it because it is a function of the successful commercialization of R&D spend. And so the effectiveness of R&D and the productivity of R&D is demonstrated, to some extent, by NPVI. Could you describe a little bit about the economic characteristics of NPVI index components and the implications for margin as well as return on capital employed of that dynamic?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nicholas Gangestad (Executives)】\nYes, I'll take that. You heard everyone of us today talk about the 4 fundamental strengths and how we are -- our analysis has shown those 4 fundamental strengths are enhancing our operating margins and our return on invested capital, innovation being the first one listed there. Our ability to innovate, to create customer relevance with our customers, to be able to price products for the value that it's creating for those customers, that's part of the operating margin, but it's also a big contributor to our ability to grow organically sometime during that 5-year time horizon. But as Mike talked about in his presentation, part of that growth is also coming after that 5-year time horizon as we continue to commercialize what we've already introduced. So we see our investment in the success of our innovation, investment in innovation, has been enhancing both our margin and our ability to grow organically. For us, it's not one or the other.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Attendee (Attendees)】\nDoes that mean the components of the NPVI have higher margin than the rest of the portfolio? Or is there no connection?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nicholas Gangestad (Executives)】\nI would be making too much of a sweeping generalization to say that one -- that component has a higher or lower operating margin than others. The fact that it's there and continually refreshing our portfolio allows us, we believe, to have an overall portfolio that has, to an extent, enhanced operating income margin. Often in the first 1 or 2 years of a product introduction launch, we face higher up-front costs in getting it launched. So in that first 1 or 2 years, likely no. But over the life cycle of that product, it definitely is enhancing our operating income margin.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Matt Ginter (Executives)】\nSteve?\n\n---\n\n【質問: C. Stephen Tusa (Analysts)】\nSteve Tusa from JPMorgan. Can you just maybe talk about the fourth quarter a bit? Are there any puts and takes within the segments? And I assume you're just eating this restructuring, and is that part of the range? Or is there something that's offsetting that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nicholas Gangestad (Executives)】\nThe things that I described when I'm saying what we're seeing as we come to the end of this year are encompassed in the range that we have put out for the total year expectation.\n\n---\n\n【質問: C. Stephen Tusa (Analysts)】\nAnd then just on the longer-term target of 4% to 6%, so you did, I think, about 3.5% in '13. You're going to do somewhere in the range of low 4s or maybe mid-4s, 4.5% this year. Next year, you're kind of at 3% to 6%. So what gets better to get you to the high end of that range on the 4% to 6% organic? I think the EPS target has been very well-delivered upon with some balance sheet -- extra balance sheet utilization. But I guess, the core growth, what gets better? Is that something you guys control? Or is that more of a macro call?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Inge Thulin (Executives)】\nI think it's -- there's 2 elements to it. So when we talk about -- so 4% and 6% for the plan and then 3% to 6% going into next year. The 3% there is a type of a little bit of uncertainty as we talked about in the economy. But what will it take for us in order to move up versus the top of that range? First of all, what we feel good about, but I -- and we hope that it could be sustainable, is what we have done in United States relative to our execution model on commercialization. As you recall, we took a hard look at that starting 2011 by focusing the U.S. businesses to focus only execution in the United States. That started to pay off for us, and the economy is improving. So when you have seen in the last couple of quarters an improved growth rate in United States, that need to continue. We also need to see that we can capitalize on the evolution of the economy in China that is not going from export to domestic, this type of addition to domestic. So we need to be able to commercialize on that and capitalize it, and China need to do slightly better than we see at this point in time. And then West Europe, I think, as H.C. rightly described it, is a slow-growing environment, but there are opportunities there. So I would say to go in the higher end of it, our plan -- we are confident that we can execute on that in U.S. now as it stands. So we hope the economy stands up. And then with China and West Europe, the top is ticking up a little bit. I think we are coming closer over time. It's not only gut feeling. I think that Nick showed the 1.7x IPI, it is clear that as we laid out the plan that we see better momentum in our ability to execute from a commercialization perspective. So I feel encouraged, I would say, with the ability. So I think it's -- we are well set, and I hope that the economy is becoming slightly better in West Europe and China. And I think we need that all in order to move it close or up on the high end of the range.\n\n---\n\n【質問: C. Stephen Tusa (Analysts)】\nAnd then just one last question, just on the margin. I guess, price raws for you guys, you've done a great job of managing that. Obviously, you're going to have a big benefit in 2015. I'm a little bit surprised that you said slightly positive price. I mean, you guys have been getting a decent amount of price, whether it's driven by foreign exchange or just blocking and tackling. If -- is that kind of the run rate we should consider now on year-over-year price with your commodities down that you're maybe giving a little bit of that back to go for volume? And then the second question is, obviously impressive, you guys are now expanding margins. Why not give a longer-term margin target? Is that something that you could add to that 2017 chart at some stage of the game now that you're kind of on the horse there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nicholas Gangestad (Executives)】\nA couple of things. On the margin expansion and the price for raw materials and why not even more price in 2015, one thing I did omit earlier: Part of our ability to drive price is part of the very innovation that we've been talking about in several of the Q&A. That has been and continues to be a driver of our price growth. One reason we're not going even further with our price growth in the 2015 is the commodity price issues that I've been talking about that will be a headwind for us on our ability on price. Once I go out beyond 2015, I do not expect -- I don't think we have enough visibility of what's happening with FX and what's happening with commodities to be making a statement about price growth going further than that, other than that what I started with our ability to innovate and what that does for our ability to drive price in the market. As far as a longer-term view, as part of our plan, when we introduced our plan for earnings per share growth, part of our plan was there were many drivers that can help us get to that 9% to 11%. To the extent that we see something's not contributing to what we expected, we may have margin as an opportunity in there for ways we can deliver that 9% to 11%. But right now, we're not seeing the need to -- we continue to see the need to keep reinvesting in our business. And for that reason, I don't think it would be wise for us to be putting an, even further out, margin target. If Inge and I or all of us up here really needed and wanted to drive up the margin in the short term, that's always a possibility, by cutting costs and doing other things. But I don't think in the long term, it would be something you the investors would be happy with because we'd be sacrificing many of the things that are driving our ability to grow organically over time.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Inge Thulin (Executives)】\nI think one thing that has been important for us is also to build a credible plan that you can follow and believe we can deliver on. And I think as we laid that out early on, there's certain things that we will like to do, which was reinvestment, et cetera and we wouldn't like, at this point in time at least, to overpromise anything on the margin side. I will say that I am encouraged with the productivity we start to see in the plan as we speak. But do we have still some work to do on the strategic investment? And some are very offensive business transformation. We will do it that we'll have incredible benefit for all of us as we go ahead. And then we have some small cleanups here in there that we try to do as well. So we just try to stay on the safe side and not overpromise and under-deliver. I think that's the motto here.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Matt Ginter (Executives)】\nJeff? Right here.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jeffrey Sprague (Analysts)】\nJeff Sprecher, Vertical Research. One for Inge and then just one for Nick. Inge, just back on the portfolio, to some of the earlier questions, if we think about those businesses that were not in Strategic Review and not in Heartland and not in Push Forward and therefore kind of in transition, so to speak, that's about $8 billion of revenue, it looks like. So I guess, it's a little unclear to me how they move out of transition, what actually changes significantly enough to alter where they sit on that map is really kind of the first question. And do we think about it's a margin improvement story or it's cash or some other kind of outcome for those businesses?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Inge Thulin (Executives)】\nYes, think about it in like many of those businesses that was categorized like in transition, some of them have been combined in one way or the other in order to drive efficiency and relevance to customers. So it was many of them that was certainly, yes, was in transition because we have not -- I would say, we have not been smart enough to really consolidate the benefit that they could do together. And in fact, I think there was even one business that was in Strategic Review that actually came out of that and moved forward relative to benefit by recombining with 2 businesses in transition. So I think we have done a lot of things for them, and I would say, they will not move into Heartland as I see it. They're coming closer to Push Forward as we go ahead. When you run an enterprise like this with 90,000 people and many, many businesses, I think the important thing is that there is a process in order, really, to help with the business plan in terms of direction going forward. That is what we try to do. So that's why I would say that in the end of 2015, there will not be a category called in transition, right? It's now your responsibility leading a business and ours to develop the plan of what this is all about as we move ahead. You need to do it as a first step, as I've done based on a couple of places before, inside in different geographical areas of 3M. The first is almost a shock for the organization when we start to categorize them, right? You get a lot of attention, I can tell you that, and progress start to happen, right? So a lot of them have been addressed, and -- but I don't see, at this point in time, that some of them will move into Heartland by definition. I think they're more apt to more growth in Push Forward.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jeffrey Sprague (Analysts)】\nJust wondering, just as a follow-up for Nick on kind of the capital deployment strategy and plan. Could you just kind of maybe back to kind of the ballpark analogy kind of bring us up-to-date on where you sit relative to the rating agencies, relative to how perhaps you're trying to manage the rating? Your ability to flex, and I kind of asked that question maybe more in the context if your entire 5-year M&A ambition happened to materialize in 2015 because these things are just episodic. Could you, in fact, do that? How would you toggle back and forth? Just frame that for us.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nicholas Gangestad (Executives)】\nWhen you think about our total 5-year capital allocation strategy, right now, we're at a low AA rate debt rating. And our 5-year strategy with the share buybacks, with the M&A, with the other investments that we've talked about there, with the added leverage, we have the capability to stay at a low AA and accomplish all of those things and still with some degrees of freedom within that. It's not pushing it to the very edge. So Jeff, I hope that's answering your question there.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Matt Ginter (Executives)】\nWe've got time for 2 more. So Deane?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Deane Dray (Analysts)】\nIt's Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Just to go back to the questions regarding the implications of all the investment in new products and disruptive technologies, I'd be interested in hearing, either philosophically or to the P&L, how you address product cannibalization. I think at the end, it all gets netted in your organic local currency growth. But just what's your tolerance? And how do you manage product cannibalization?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Inge Thulin (Executives)】\nYes, we categorize new products in 3 different categories. So for simplification, let's call them A, B and C. A is where we basically introduce -- well we cannibalize ourself. That's what we do in A. In B is where we develop new products into current channels and current customers. And then C is the disruptive technology. So when you look upon the facts and data, we are very good in category A. We know how to do that constantly. That's fantastic machine, people are on it the whole time, and as you know, it's better to do it to yourself than someone else to do it, right? So that is doing very well. We are also pretty good in category B, which is new product to current channels and customers. It's a very effective, productive way of introduce and expand. And then the challenge we have was in the last category C, where we make those investments as we move ahead. And when we looked upon it, it's like in the 2 first categories, most of our growth came there, right? And it's typological when you think about it because disruptive technology, as I said earlier, is more difficult to go on when you need to stay on course to deliver every quarter and every year, right? So you chip away and you hold off, et cetera. So think about them in those 3 categories. We call them 3, 4 and 5 internally, but you have to simplify them in that way. And so you would like to get -- for me, you need to first-class where you cannibalize yourself. That's a must. You do it the whole time. The very effective way is the second class, right, where you are able to utilize your connections with a channel of customers and introduce new product, so a very -- so we do -- we put a lot of focus actually now on that category to see how can we boost that even more, right? So Ashish Khandpur is our new CTO, is driving that with additional emphasis into our businesses.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Matt Ginter (Executives)】\nOkay. Last question, Dave Begleiter.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Begleiter (Analysts)】\nDave Begleiter, Deutsche Bank. Nick, one more time on raws. What is your -- where are your Brent and WTI forecast for 2015? And what is your earnings sensitivity to a $10 change in oil prices in 2015?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nicholas Gangestad (Executives)】\nThe $0.15 to $0.25 earnings per share impact from raw materials is built around an assumption of oil prices being between $60 and $70 a barrel. And then the second part, sensitivity, a $10 move in oil prices, I'm doing the math as I think here, probably, $0.02. About $0.02, David.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Matt Ginter (Executives)】\nOkay. All right. Well, thanks for coming. It was a great day. Appreciate your attention very much. And if you have follow-ups, please let us know. Thanks.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Inge Thulin (Executives)】\nThank you.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you, operator. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss NIKE's fiscal 2015 second quarter results. As the operator indicated, participants on today's call may discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the appropriate reconciliations in our press release, which was issued about an hour ago, and at our website, investors.nike.com.\r\nJoining us on today's call will be NIKE, Inc. President and CEO, Mark Parker; followed by Trevor Edwards, President of the NIKE Brand; and finally, you will hear from our Chief Financial Officer, Don Blair, who will give you an in-depth review of our financial results. Following their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. [Operator Instructions] I'll now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc. President and CEO, Mark Parker.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Kelley, and hello, everyone, and happy holidays. Q2 was another outstanding quarter for NIKE, and it demonstrates our ability to continue to drive strong, profitable, sustainable growth.\r\nFor the quarter, NIKE, Inc. revenues increased 15% to $7.4 billion. Gross margin expanded 120 basis points; diluted earnings per share increased to 25% to $0.74; and we continue to deliver strong returns as our ROIC reached 27%; and we increased our dividend for the 13th year in a row.\r\nDelivering results like these requires a sharp focus on our growth opportunities, making disciplined choices to invest in those areas with the highest potential for return. The world of sport is constantly evolving, as is the environment in which we operate. That opens up new opportunities for NIKE every day. But to identify and capitalize on those opportunities, we have to stay nimble. We need to balance, making critical investments with managing risk, whether they be currency headwinds, commodity costs fluctuations or an evolving political landscape. The word balance is key. \r\nTo capture the tremendous growth potential we see for NIKE, we must invest, and a targeted approach to making the right investments helps us drive growth and manage risk. It's a winning strategy that has allowed us to deliver profitable, sustainable growth quarter after quarter, year after year.\r\nI'm often asked how we can continue to grow, how there could still be places where NIKE isn't fully distributed. When I look at the potential in our business, I actually see the exact opposite. The more we focus on knowing, connecting and serving the consumer, the more opportunity I see for growth. And then [ph] we capture those opportunities by leveraging the power of the NIKE portfolio. \r\nLet's take apparel as an example. Today, NIKE is one of the largest apparel brands in the world. But as we look up and down our apparel business, we see tremendous opportunity from premium performance apparel to signature sportswear styles, from Running to Basketball, to Global Football, from North America and Western Europe to China, from the NIKE Brand, to Brand Jordan, to Converse, across men's, women's and young athletes. And within each of those dimensions, we segment further and further to find even more opportunity to drive growth. Our diverse set of brands, categories, geographies, product types and distribution channels provides a competitive advantage that is unmatched. And our relentless focus on serving the consumer allows us to see ever expanding opportunities for growth within our existing portfolio.\r\nTrevor will talk in more depth about our growth drivers in the NIKE Brand, but let me highlight 2 additional areas that we've been investing in to accelerate growth in our business. \r\nFirst, our women's business. In October, I was honored to be a part of a powerful moment for NIKE Women's. We introduced our Spring Summer 2015 Collections in New York City with 27 of the world's top athletes. It was amazing to have grand slam winners, world record holders and Olympic champions all in one place at the same time. We were also there to spotlight an important cultural shift that's happening, and sport is powering women's lives like never before. We see it every day in our digital community of 65 million women. And women are driving a larger global movement of health and fitness. They're running in record numbers. They're engaging in new kinds of workouts and athletic activities at a rapid pace. And that means they have new needs, which are creating new insights and inspiring new products and services. And by staying focused on the needs of the consumer, we're driving growth in our women's business. There is tremendous energy in women's and a significant opportunity for us in this important business.\r\nSecond is our digital strategy. We see digital as an integrated ecosystem of digital communication with consumers, digital products and services to inspire and motivate and of course, e-commerce. All 3 dimensions work together to deliver premium, personalized experiences for our consumers and drive growth for NIKE. Consumers are engaging with technology in new ways. It's transforming the sport experience and the way in which we connect with them. Athletes are getting a better understanding of themselves and their potential than they've ever had before. And we're able to connect personally with more consumers than ever. Digital is where the consumer is today and where they will be going forward. And we're excited about the potential of leveraging digital technology to further drive innovation and continue to deliver increasingly seamless digital experiences for our consumers.\r\nGoing a little bit deeper on e-commerce, it continues to deliver, with growth of 65% for the quarter. Our investments in infrastructure are really paying off in this space. We're making it easier for consumers to buy our products and we're presenting the brand in the most premium way. With opportunity for even more innovation and expansion into new markets, this really is just the beginning of what's possible for NIKE.com. E-commerce is, without a doubt, one of our biggest and most important growth opportunities, and it will be for years to come.\r\nOne of the reasons I'm so confident in our growth potential for NIKE.com, and really across our entire portfolio, is because NIKE is relentless. We are always striving to deliver something better for the athlete and the consumer. We are, in a word, obsessed, and that obsession fuels innovation. Since day 1, we've looked to athletes as a source of inspiration, and that hasn't changed. What has changed is the pace at which athletes demand more of themselves. As they strive for new levels of performance, they demand products that help them get stronger, faster and more agile, really better in every way. And that pushes us to deliver innovative products and services that go beyond what anyone thought was possible. And it requires us to accelerate the pace of our innovation, to improve not only what we make but how we make it. Today, we have tools and resources available to us that would have been unimaginable 5 years ago, from 3D printers, to high-performance knitting machines, to advanced textiles, just to name a few. \r\nAnd we're not only focused on the quantum leaps in product innovation. Equally exciting is our focus on continuously evolving our existing and proven performance technologies. Nike Air continues to be reinvented, as is Nike Free, Lunar and Tech Fleece. We create products that are completely new, and we make our existing products better. We introduce game-changing innovation in every category in every global market and at scale. No one else can deliver innovation like NIKE can, and that is our greatest competitive advantage as a company. Our ability to leverage and scale this innovation through compelling concepts and technologies across our portfolio of brands and categories, geographies and distribution channels and on the world's best athletes and teams is driving tremendous growth for NIKE around the world.\r\nAnd while I'm proud of the results we're reporting today, I assure you that we are hungry, we're driven and we are laser-focused on the future. Our success lies in our ability to see what is possible and then relentlessly pursue it, to stay aggressive always, and remembering, as we say every day here at NIKE, the consumer decides. Our business has breadth and depth at a scale that is unmatched in our industry and we have the leadership team and the strategy to drive sustainable growth. That is what you've seen from NIKE in the past and that is what you can continue to expect from us going forward.\r\nThanks. And now, here's Trevor.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Mark. Happy holidays, everyone. Our strong second quarter results demonstrate the tremendous momentum of the NIKE Brand. Let's take a look at the numbers.\r\nOn a constant-currency basis, NIKE Brand revenue grew 17%. All geographies grew in the quarter, as did all categories, except Golf. The NIKE Brand DTC revenue increased 30%, driven by all concepts. Notably, our online business continues to be very strong with 66% growth in the quarter. And global futures are up 11%, even as we anniversary the strong World Cup orders in the prior year.\r\nThe reason we deliver strong growth across our geographies and categories time and time again is clear: we never lose focus on serving our consumers. As always, these strong relationships are fueled by the power of our brands and the category offense. As we've discussed before, the category offense deepens our relationships with consumers by serving them through the lens of sport that matters most to them as they compete, train and express themselves. In other words, we live where they live.\r\nWhat's more, only NIKE has the broad portfolio and global reach to execute this strategy around the world. We know what works and we know how to identify large, untapped opportunities, develop innovative products and marketing strategies on a global scale and execute them effectively in each marketplace around the world.\r\nNow let's look at 2 examples of the category offense at work. Basketball and our women's business, it's no secret why we succeed in Basketball. Our relationship with the world's best athletes provide us great insight that produce incredible product innovation. And these products, in turn, excite and inspire consumers all over the world. Q2 was the 13th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth for our Basketball category. Our position as the world's leader in basketball was supported by strong sell-through of key Nike Basketball footwear styles like the LeBron 12 and the KD7. And the Jordan Brand remains a powerful growth driver with performance products like the Air Jordan 29, as well as re-releases like the Retro Jordan 6. \r\nYou can see this energy come to life with growth throughout the marketplace, from performance to sportswear and across footwear and apparel styles. Retail destinations like our own DTC stores, or the House of Hoops, with Foot Locker, remain go-to locations for those who love the sport. \r\nAnd momentum in this category is not limited to North America. We're also seeing great consumer response to basketball retail destinations in Europe and China, which help us realize the significant potential of these growing markets.\r\nNow let's take a look at the women's business. As Mark mentioned, the momentum we're seeing in this business is incredible. The energy was certainly visible at our recent women's event in New York. I will never forget the thrill of seeing some of the world's greatest athletes, including Li Na, Allyson Felix and Skylar Diggins discussing their successes and the power of women in sports. It was truly inspiring.\r\nLooking forward, we remain on the path to meet our goal of a $7 billion women's business by fiscal year '17. We achieve this by making deep connections with consumers in the areas they most -- that's most important to them: Running, training and sportswear. Our strategy means connecting and serving millions of women through the digital platforms, elevating the online and in-store shopping experiences, offering premium product assortments that drive real growth, and as always, leading with innovative products. These products offer consumer great fit and amazing style like never before, and they're presented at retail in a compelling and captivating way.\r\nGreat product examples from the quarter include the NIKE Pro Base Layer collection and the continued strength of the NIKE Pro Bra as well as performance-inspired style of the Air Max collection. What's more, we opened women's-only Nike stores in Newport Beach and Shanghai to strong consumer response. Ultimately, we see Q2 as just the beginning of great things to come in our women's business.\r\nNow let's turn to a few of our key geographies. In North America, we delivered another great quarter, with Q2 revenue growth of 16%. That growth proves, yet again, the success of our strategies. For us, North America offers a roadmap for other geographies as we continue to deliver strong growth in this critical marketplace. By developing deep consumer relationships through the category offense and delivering segmented and differentiated retail destination, we've driven sustained, profitable growth even in more developed markets where we already have significant market share. \r\nOur brand continues to resonate with consumers in North America, which is driving growth in nearly every category. Basketball, sportswear and men's training have continued to perform well, and we've seen clear acceleration in our women's and young athlete businesses. \r\nWorking with our partners, we've continued to see growth as we further transform the marketplace in executions such as the Field House with Dick's Sporting Goods; the Track Club at the Finish Line; and the young athletes concept, Fly Zone, with Foot Locker. Additionally, our DTC business has continued to expand with an increase of 18% in quarter 2. By providing the product and experiences our consumers demand, we expect to continue to drive growth in our largest geography.\r\nIn Greater China, we continue to see the benefits of our strategy to reset the marketplace. Q2 revenue growth of 21% reflects our plan to deploy a more consumer-centric distribution strategy, and this approach is definitely working. The NIKE Brand is exceptionally strong with consumers in China, and we hold the #1 market share position in both athletic footwear and apparel. Our leadership position as a premium performance brand allows us to present the innovative products in the most compelling retail destinations in the marketplace. As a result, our wholesale partners have continued to see strong comp store growth and expanding profitability in the doors that have been re-profiled. This success mirrors the exceptional numbers we've seen in our own doors. We have driven this return to growth by focusing on increased retail productivity, differentiating our point of distribution and creating more focused consumer experiences. This allows us to provide a narrow yet deep product assortment in each door. This better serves the consumer and also allows us to maintain the healthy inventory levels we are currently seeing in the market. We remain confident that we have the right strategy to drive a sustainable, profitable growth in China over the long term. \r\nNow let's turn to the emerging markets, which delivered 13% revenue growth in the quarter, every territory except Mexico and Korea, with 5 of them growing at a double-digit rate. We also saw strong performance coming from sportswear and basketball categories in the quarter.\r\nAs we discussed, inventory levels in Mexico remain high. This is primarily the result of an inconsistent flow of product to our wholesale partners following transition issues with our distribution center in the early fiscal year 2014. We continue to work aggressively to clear excess inventory and expect to return to more normalized levels by the end of fiscal year '15. \r\nAs with every territory of the world, our goal is to operate a healthy pull [ph] market, and we believe we are taking the necessary actions to achieve that goal in Mexico.\r\nIn Brazil, Q2 revenue growth slowed as volatile macroeconomic conditions made for a more challenging environment. That said, we see this environment as an opportunity to do what we do best: accelerate our transformation of the marketplace fueled by the category offense. The consumer's passion for sport and the NIKE Brand remain strong, and we are focused on creating elevated and differentiated retail experiences for our consumers in Brazil, as we have done in North America, Western Europe and China. Online executions through NIKE.com will serve as the most premium expression of the brand, offering rich product assortments across a broad range of categories. We're also working with our wholesale partners to create compelling destinations at retail, with a focus on our biggest categories: Running, Football and Sportswear. Near-term, we are working to keep the market healthy in Brazil. We are proactively managing the flow of product into the marketplace whilst also swiftly working to clear any excess inventory through the closeout channel. Long-term, we remain confident that the emerging markets geography will drive significant growth for the NIKE Brand.\r\nLastly, let's take a look at Western Europe. With revenue up 24% in the quarter, we continue to see strong momentum for the NIKE Brand. The exceptional growth was driven by our relentless focus on the consumer and our work to transform the marketplace, in line with the category offense. We continue to develop more differentiated retail executions, both in our stores and with our wholesale partners, while continuing to flow amazing products into the marketplace. All this combines to expand the market and help us take market share. Wholesale partners like Foot Locker, JD Sports and Intersport are creating compelling category destinations in cities across the geography that are fueling growth.\r\nAnd just as we've seen in North America, our DTC business in Western Europe also continues to perform very well, delivering 40% growth in the quarter. This resulted in a double digit revenue growth in every territory and strong growth across every category -- nearly every category, with Sportswear, Football and Running leading the way. Western Europe is a perfect example of the tremendous opportunity that lies ahead for the NIKE Brand to drive long-term growth.\r\nAs we finish the first half of the year, the NIKE Brand has never been stronger. By staying focused on the needs of the consumer, we have driven exceptional revenue and profit growth. While we feel great about the results we've delivered to date, we're never satisfied. Like the athletes we serve, our focus is always on continuing to elevate our performance, and that's what we'll do in the second half of the year and beyond. \r\nThanks. Now here's Don.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Trevor. You've often heard us use the phrase NIKE is a growth company. Over our history, we delivered sustained growth in revenues, profits and cash returns to shareholders. The level we've delivered in recent years is particularly distinctive in today's highly volatile and growth-challenged environment. \r\nBut the phrase is more than a description of the results we produced. It's a key element of our business philosophy. NIKE as a growth company is embodied in the NIKE maxims, the principles we use to define our corporate culture. NIKE as a growth company means that our potential is continuously expanding and that the numbers like the current size of a market or a previous peak profit margin are only signposts, not limits. It means we can create growth by investing to build deep personal connections with athletes and consumers, by investing to deliver exceptional product innovations and by investing to create premium integrated marketplaces. And NIKE as a growth company means we can leverage our global portfolio and operating capabilities to deliver sustainable, profitable growth, manage risk and create shareholder value.\r\nWith that introduction, I'll now recap our Q2 results. Second quarter reported revenue for NIKE, Inc. increased 15%. On a currency-neutral basis, revenue increased 18% as the NIKE Brand grew 17% and Converse increased 24%. Also on a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand futures orders grew 11%, driven by a 6% increase in average selling price and a 5% increase in units. The growth reflects continued strong demand for the NIKE Brand even as we anniversary robust prior year orders for Global Football product in advance of the 2014 World Cup. Excluding Global Football, total futures order growth this quarter was essentially in line with the numbers we reported last quarter. Specifically, this quarter's futures growth was led by double-digit expansion in North America, Europe and Greater China, with strong demand across multiple categories, including Sportswear, Basketball and Running. On a reported basis, futures grew 7%, reflecting weaker international currencies, particularly the euro, Argentine peso, ruble and yen.\r\nSecond quarter diluted EPS increased 25% to $0.74, driven by strong revenue growth, gross margin expansion and a lower share count, partially offset by higher SG&A investments.\r\nGross margin expanded 120 basis points in the quarter. The increase was driven by a mix shift to higher-margin products, continued growth in our higher-margin DTC business and a modest benefit from FX, partially offset by higher product input costs.\r\nSecond quarter demand creation spending increased 11%, driven by digital brand marketing, sports marketing and consumer events around the globe.\r\nQ2 operating overhead increased 19%, reflecting growth in our higher gross margin and higher cost DTC business, targeted investments in operational infrastructure and continued investments in digital, including consumer engagement.\r\nThe Q2 effective tax rate was 25.4%, a 20 basis point increase, primarily due to adjustments to tax expense on intercompany transactions and the benefit realized in the prior period from the U.S. R&D tax credit. These items were partially offset by an increase in earnings from operations outside the U.S, which are generally subject to a lower tax rate and the resolution of tax audits across multiple jurisdictions.\r\nInventories at November 30 were up 11% and remain healthy overall, with the majority of the growth in North America, Europe and Converse, and driven in part by the expansion of our DTC business. We continue to focus on inventory management, with particular attention on Brazil and Mexico, where we're working to balance supply and demand to position those markets for ongoing growth.\r\nNow let's take a look at some performance highlights by segment. In North America, Q2 revenue increased 16% on both a reported and currency-neutral basis, led by double-digit growth in the Basketball, Sportswear, Men's Training and Women's Training categories. Direct-to-Consumer revenues grew 18%, driven by 8% comp store sales growth, continued strong growth of NIKE.com and new stores. On a reported basis, Q2 EBIT for North America grew 21%, driven by revenue growth and gross margin expansion.\r\nIn Western Europe, Q2 revenues increased 24% on a currency-neutral basis. The growth was broad-based as every territory increased at a double digit rate. Every key category also grew, led by double digit growth for Sportswear, Football and Running.\r\nOn a reported basis, Q2 revenue for Western Europe increased 22%. Second quarter EBIT increased 112%, driven primarily by strong revenue growth, gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage. EBIT growth for Western Europe also benefited from 2 nonoperating items: a legal charge included in last year's Q2 results; and more favorable, standardized exchange rates that we use for our geography segment reporting. The latter upside was largely offset within the corporate segment of our consolidated results.\r\nRevenue in Central and Eastern Europe accelerated in the quarter, expanding 25% on a currency-neutral basis. Excluding Israel, every territory reported double digit revenue growth, and every key category expanded, except Action Sports. Despite strong FX headwinds, reported revenue for CEE grew 17%, and EBIT grew 19%, driven by strong revenue growth and SG&A leverage.\r\nIn Greater China, currency-neutral and reported revenue grew 21%, led by double digit growth in Sportswear, Running and Basketball. As Trevor discussed, the NIKE Brand continues to lead the market, and we're pleased with the results of our work to reset the marketplace for a sustainable, profitable growth. On a reported basis, Q2 EBIT in Greater China increased 31%, driven by strong revenue growth and significant gross margin expansion, partially offset by increased investments in DTC and our new Shanghai campus. Given the continuing benefits of our strategy to reset the market, we now expect full year FY '15 revenue in China to grow at a mid-teens rate.\r\nIn the emerging markets geography, Q2 revenue grew 13% on a currency-neutral basis, as all territories except Mexico and Korea posted higher revenues. From a category perspective, the growth was led by Sportswear, Basketball and Running. Reported Q2 results in the emerging markets geography reflected the translation and gross margin impact of strong FX headwinds, as reported revenue increased only 4% and EBIT decreased 3%. The reduction in profitability was primarily due to lower gross margin and higher operating overhead for new retail stores. We continue to be confident in the long-term growth potential of the territories that comprise our emerging markets geography. And as Trevor discussed earlier, we're executing plans in each of them to realize that potential.\r\nFor Converse, revenue grew 24% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by continued strength in existing direct distribution markets such as the U.S, the growth of DTC and market conversions in Europe and Asia. On a reported basis, revenue increased 21%, but EBIT decreased 12%, driven by investments in infrastructure, demand creation and DTC to enable long-term growth. \r\nOver the last 90 days, we've seen our business performance accelerate, and we expect that trend to continue into the second half of fiscal '15. At the same time, the dollar has strengthened against most other currencies and the FX markets have been extremely volatile. While our trading company structure and hedge programs do protect us from some of that volatility, we cannot entirely eliminate all FX risk.\r\nBased on what we know today, we expect the net impact of these 2 factors, the strengthening currency-neutral business performance and the downside from the stronger dollar, will net together to deliver full year results largely in line with the expectations we shared 90 days ago. Specifically, for Q3, we expect constant dollar revenue growth in the low teens, with reported revenue growth about 3 points lower, reflecting the stronger dollar. For the full year, we expect constant dollar revenue growth in the low double digits, with reported revenue growth 2 to 3 points lower. \r\nWe expect gross margin for Q3 to expand by about 100 basis points. Growth in our higher-margin businesses including DTC and strategies to increase average selling prices will continue into the second half of the year. These benefits will help to offset increases in product input costs, our actions to clear excess inventory in the emerging markets and increased FX pressure. For the full year, we now expect gross margin expansion of 100 to 125 basis points. \r\nWe expect demand creation to grow at a high-single to low double-digit rate for Q3 and at a high single-digit rate for the full year. Operating overhead is now expected to grow at a high-teens rate for Q3 and the full year, reflecting higher variable DTC expenses as well as investments in digital innovation, new operating capabilities and expanded capacity. We continue to expect the effective tax rate for FY '15 will be approximately 24.5%.\r\nAs you've heard from all 3 of us today, we're pleased with the results we delivered in the first half of FY '15 and the momentum we see in our business. And notwithstanding the volatility we've seen recently in the macro environment, we're confident we're on track to deliver strong growth for this fiscal year.\r\nWe're now ready to take your questions.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Kelley Hall (Executives)】\nThank you, operator. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss NIKE's fiscal 2015 second quarter results. As the operator indicated, participants on today's call may discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the appropriate reconciliations in our press release, which was issued about an hour ago, and at our website, investors.nike.com.\r\nJoining us on today's call will be NIKE, Inc. President and CEO, Mark Parker; followed by Trevor Edwards, President of the NIKE Brand; and finally, you will hear from our Chief Financial Officer, Don Blair, who will give you an in-depth review of our financial results. Following their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. [Operator Instructions] I'll now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc. President and CEO, Mark Parker.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Mark Parker (Executives)】\nThank you, Kelley, and hello, everyone, and happy holidays. Q2 was another outstanding quarter for NIKE, and it demonstrates our ability to continue to drive strong, profitable, sustainable growth.\r\nFor the quarter, NIKE, Inc. revenues increased 15% to $7.4 billion. Gross margin expanded 120 basis points; diluted earnings per share increased to 25% to $0.74; and we continue to deliver strong returns as our ROIC reached 27%; and we increased our dividend for the 13th year in a row.\r\nDelivering results like these requires a sharp focus on our growth opportunities, making disciplined choices to invest in those areas with the highest potential for return. The world of sport is constantly evolving, as is the environment in which we operate. That opens up new opportunities for NIKE every day. But to identify and capitalize on those opportunities, we have to stay nimble. We need to balance, making critical investments with managing risk, whether they be currency headwinds, commodity costs fluctuations or an evolving political landscape. The word balance is key. \r\nTo capture the tremendous growth potential we see for NIKE, we must invest, and a targeted approach to making the right investments helps us drive growth and manage risk. It's a winning strategy that has allowed us to deliver profitable, sustainable growth quarter after quarter, year after year.\r\nI'm often asked how we can continue to grow, how there could still be places where NIKE isn't fully distributed. When I look at the potential in our business, I actually see the exact opposite. The more we focus on knowing, connecting and serving the consumer, the more opportunity I see for growth. And then [ph] we capture those opportunities by leveraging the power of the NIKE portfolio. \r\nLet's take apparel as an example. Today, NIKE is one of the largest apparel brands in the world. But as we look up and down our apparel business, we see tremendous opportunity from premium performance apparel to signature sportswear styles, from Running to Basketball, to Global Football, from North America and Western Europe to China, from the NIKE Brand, to Brand Jordan, to Converse, across men's, women's and young athletes. And within each of those dimensions, we segment further and further to find even more opportunity to drive growth. Our diverse set of brands, categories, geographies, product types and distribution channels provides a competitive advantage that is unmatched. And our relentless focus on serving the consumer allows us to see ever expanding opportunities for growth within our existing portfolio.\r\nTrevor will talk in more depth about our growth drivers in the NIKE Brand, but let me highlight 2 additional areas that we've been investing in to accelerate growth in our business. \r\nFirst, our women's business. In October, I was honored to be a part of a powerful moment for NIKE Women's. We introduced our Spring Summer 2015 Collections in New York City with 27 of the world's top athletes. It was amazing to have grand slam winners, world record holders and Olympic champions all in one place at the same time. We were also there to spotlight an important cultural shift that's happening, and sport is powering women's lives like never before. We see it every day in our digital community of 65 million women. And women are driving a larger global movement of health and fitness. They're running in record numbers. They're engaging in new kinds of workouts and athletic activities at a rapid pace. And that means they have new needs, which are creating new insights and inspiring new products and services. And by staying focused on the needs of the consumer, we're driving growth in our women's business. There is tremendous energy in women's and a significant opportunity for us in this important business.\r\nSecond is our digital strategy. We see digital as an integrated ecosystem of digital communication with consumers, digital products and services to inspire and motivate and of course, e-commerce. All 3 dimensions work together to deliver premium, personalized experiences for our consumers and drive growth for NIKE. Consumers are engaging with technology in new ways. It's transforming the sport experience and the way in which we connect with them. Athletes are getting a better understanding of themselves and their potential than they've ever had before. And we're able to connect personally with more consumers than ever. Digital is where the consumer is today and where they will be going forward. And we're excited about the potential of leveraging digital technology to further drive innovation and continue to deliver increasingly seamless digital experiences for our consumers.\r\nGoing a little bit deeper on e-commerce, it continues to deliver, with growth of 65% for the quarter. Our investments in infrastructure are really paying off in this space. We're making it easier for consumers to buy our products and we're presenting the brand in the most premium way. With opportunity for even more innovation and expansion into new markets, this really is just the beginning of what's possible for NIKE.com. E-commerce is, without a doubt, one of our biggest and most important growth opportunities, and it will be for years to come.\r\nOne of the reasons I'm so confident in our growth potential for NIKE.com, and really across our entire portfolio, is because NIKE is relentless. We are always striving to deliver something better for the athlete and the consumer. We are, in a word, obsessed, and that obsession fuels innovation. Since day 1, we've looked to athletes as a source of inspiration, and that hasn't changed. What has changed is the pace at which athletes demand more of themselves. As they strive for new levels of performance, they demand products that help them get stronger, faster and more agile, really better in every way. And that pushes us to deliver innovative products and services that go beyond what anyone thought was possible. And it requires us to accelerate the pace of our innovation, to improve not only what we make but how we make it. Today, we have tools and resources available to us that would have been unimaginable 5 years ago, from 3D printers, to high-performance knitting machines, to advanced textiles, just to name a few. \r\nAnd we're not only focused on the quantum leaps in product innovation. Equally exciting is our focus on continuously evolving our existing and proven performance technologies. Nike Air continues to be reinvented, as is Nike Free, Lunar and Tech Fleece. We create products that are completely new, and we make our existing products better. We introduce game-changing innovation in every category in every global market and at scale. No one else can deliver innovation like NIKE can, and that is our greatest competitive advantage as a company. Our ability to leverage and scale this innovation through compelling concepts and technologies across our portfolio of brands and categories, geographies and distribution channels and on the world's best athletes and teams is driving tremendous growth for NIKE around the world.\r\nAnd while I'm proud of the results we're reporting today, I assure you that we are hungry, we're driven and we are laser-focused on the future. Our success lies in our ability to see what is possible and then relentlessly pursue it, to stay aggressive always, and remembering, as we say every day here at NIKE, the consumer decides. Our business has breadth and depth at a scale that is unmatched in our industry and we have the leadership team and the strategy to drive sustainable growth. That is what you've seen from NIKE in the past and that is what you can continue to expect from us going forward.\r\nThanks. And now, here's Trevor.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Trevor Edwards (Executives)】\nThank you, Mark. Happy holidays, everyone. Our strong second quarter results demonstrate the tremendous momentum of the NIKE Brand. Let's take a look at the numbers.\r\nOn a constant-currency basis, NIKE Brand revenue grew 17%. All geographies grew in the quarter, as did all categories, except Golf. The NIKE Brand DTC revenue increased 30%, driven by all concepts. Notably, our online business continues to be very strong with 66% growth in the quarter. And global futures are up 11%, even as we anniversary the strong World Cup orders in the prior year.\r\nThe reason we deliver strong growth across our geographies and categories time and time again is clear: we never lose focus on serving our consumers. As always, these strong relationships are fueled by the power of our brands and the category offense. As we've discussed before, the category offense deepens our relationships with consumers by serving them through the lens of sport that matters most to them as they compete, train and express themselves. In other words, we live where they live.\r\nWhat's more, only NIKE has the broad portfolio and global reach to execute this strategy around the world. We know what works and we know how to identify large, untapped opportunities, develop innovative products and marketing strategies on a global scale and execute them effectively in each marketplace around the world.\r\nNow let's look at 2 examples of the category offense at work. Basketball and our women's business, it's no secret why we succeed in Basketball. Our relationship with the world's best athletes provide us great insight that produce incredible product innovation. And these products, in turn, excite and inspire consumers all over the world. Q2 was the 13th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth for our Basketball category. Our position as the world's leader in basketball was supported by strong sell-through of key Nike Basketball footwear styles like the LeBron 12 and the KD7. And the Jordan Brand remains a powerful growth driver with performance products like the Air Jordan 29, as well as re-releases like the Retro Jordan 6. \r\nYou can see this energy come to life with growth throughout the marketplace, from performance to sportswear and across footwear and apparel styles. Retail destinations like our own DTC stores, or the House of Hoops, with Foot Locker, remain go-to locations for those who love the sport. \r\nAnd momentum in this category is not limited to North America. We're also seeing great consumer response to basketball retail destinations in Europe and China, which help us realize the significant potential of these growing markets.\r\nNow let's take a look at the women's business. As Mark mentioned, the momentum we're seeing in this business is incredible. The energy was certainly visible at our recent women's event in New York. I will never forget the thrill of seeing some of the world's greatest athletes, including Li Na, Allyson Felix and Skylar Diggins discussing their successes and the power of women in sports. It was truly inspiring.\r\nLooking forward, we remain on the path to meet our goal of a $7 billion women's business by fiscal year '17. We achieve this by making deep connections with consumers in the areas they most -- that's most important to them: Running, training and sportswear. Our strategy means connecting and serving millions of women through the digital platforms, elevating the online and in-store shopping experiences, offering premium product assortments that drive real growth, and as always, leading with innovative products. These products offer consumer great fit and amazing style like never before, and they're presented at retail in a compelling and captivating way.\r\nGreat product examples from the quarter include the NIKE Pro Base Layer collection and the continued strength of the NIKE Pro Bra as well as performance-inspired style of the Air Max collection. What's more, we opened women's-only Nike stores in Newport Beach and Shanghai to strong consumer response. Ultimately, we see Q2 as just the beginning of great things to come in our women's business.\r\nNow let's turn to a few of our key geographies. In North America, we delivered another great quarter, with Q2 revenue growth of 16%. That growth proves, yet again, the success of our strategies. For us, North America offers a roadmap for other geographies as we continue to deliver strong growth in this critical marketplace. By developing deep consumer relationships through the category offense and delivering segmented and differentiated retail destination, we've driven sustained, profitable growth even in more developed markets where we already have significant market share. \r\nOur brand continues to resonate with consumers in North America, which is driving growth in nearly every category. Basketball, sportswear and men's training have continued to perform well, and we've seen clear acceleration in our women's and young athlete businesses. \r\nWorking with our partners, we've continued to see growth as we further transform the marketplace in executions such as the Field House with Dick's Sporting Goods; the Track Club at the Finish Line; and the young athletes concept, Fly Zone, with Foot Locker. Additionally, our DTC business has continued to expand with an increase of 18% in quarter 2. By providing the product and experiences our consumers demand, we expect to continue to drive growth in our largest geography.\r\nIn Greater China, we continue to see the benefits of our strategy to reset the marketplace. Q2 revenue growth of 21% reflects our plan to deploy a more consumer-centric distribution strategy, and this approach is definitely working. The NIKE Brand is exceptionally strong with consumers in China, and we hold the #1 market share position in both athletic footwear and apparel. Our leadership position as a premium performance brand allows us to present the innovative products in the most compelling retail destinations in the marketplace. As a result, our wholesale partners have continued to see strong comp store growth and expanding profitability in the doors that have been re-profiled. This success mirrors the exceptional numbers we've seen in our own doors. We have driven this return to growth by focusing on increased retail productivity, differentiating our point of distribution and creating more focused consumer experiences. This allows us to provide a narrow yet deep product assortment in each door. This better serves the consumer and also allows us to maintain the healthy inventory levels we are currently seeing in the market. We remain confident that we have the right strategy to drive a sustainable, profitable growth in China over the long term. \r\nNow let's turn to the emerging markets, which delivered 13% revenue growth in the quarter, every territory except Mexico and Korea, with 5 of them growing at a double-digit rate. We also saw strong performance coming from sportswear and basketball categories in the quarter.\r\nAs we discussed, inventory levels in Mexico remain high. This is primarily the result of an inconsistent flow of product to our wholesale partners following transition issues with our distribution center in the early fiscal year 2014. We continue to work aggressively to clear excess inventory and expect to return to more normalized levels by the end of fiscal year '15. \r\nAs with every territory of the world, our goal is to operate a healthy pull [ph] market, and we believe we are taking the necessary actions to achieve that goal in Mexico.\r\nIn Brazil, Q2 revenue growth slowed as volatile macroeconomic conditions made for a more challenging environment. That said, we see this environment as an opportunity to do what we do best: accelerate our transformation of the marketplace fueled by the category offense. The consumer's passion for sport and the NIKE Brand remain strong, and we are focused on creating elevated and differentiated retail experiences for our consumers in Brazil, as we have done in North America, Western Europe and China. Online executions through NIKE.com will serve as the most premium expression of the brand, offering rich product assortments across a broad range of categories. We're also working with our wholesale partners to create compelling destinations at retail, with a focus on our biggest categories: Running, Football and Sportswear. Near-term, we are working to keep the market healthy in Brazil. We are proactively managing the flow of product into the marketplace whilst also swiftly working to clear any excess inventory through the closeout channel. Long-term, we remain confident that the emerging markets geography will drive significant growth for the NIKE Brand.\r\nLastly, let's take a look at Western Europe. With revenue up 24% in the quarter, we continue to see strong momentum for the NIKE Brand. The exceptional growth was driven by our relentless focus on the consumer and our work to transform the marketplace, in line with the category offense. We continue to develop more differentiated retail executions, both in our stores and with our wholesale partners, while continuing to flow amazing products into the marketplace. All this combines to expand the market and help us take market share. Wholesale partners like Foot Locker, JD Sports and Intersport are creating compelling category destinations in cities across the geography that are fueling growth.\r\nAnd just as we've seen in North America, our DTC business in Western Europe also continues to perform very well, delivering 40% growth in the quarter. This resulted in a double digit revenue growth in every territory and strong growth across every category -- nearly every category, with Sportswear, Football and Running leading the way. Western Europe is a perfect example of the tremendous opportunity that lies ahead for the NIKE Brand to drive long-term growth.\r\nAs we finish the first half of the year, the NIKE Brand has never been stronger. By staying focused on the needs of the consumer, we have driven exceptional revenue and profit growth. While we feel great about the results we've delivered to date, we're never satisfied. Like the athletes we serve, our focus is always on continuing to elevate our performance, and that's what we'll do in the second half of the year and beyond. \r\nThanks. Now here's Don.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Donald Blair (Executives)】\nThanks, Trevor. You've often heard us use the phrase NIKE is a growth company. Over our history, we delivered sustained growth in revenues, profits and cash returns to shareholders. The level we've delivered in recent years is particularly distinctive in today's highly volatile and growth-challenged environment. \r\nBut the phrase is more than a description of the results we produced. It's a key element of our business philosophy. NIKE as a growth company is embodied in the NIKE maxims, the principles we use to define our corporate culture. NIKE as a growth company means that our potential is continuously expanding and that the numbers like the current size of a market or a previous peak profit margin are only signposts, not limits. It means we can create growth by investing to build deep personal connections with athletes and consumers, by investing to deliver exceptional product innovations and by investing to create premium integrated marketplaces. And NIKE as a growth company means we can leverage our global portfolio and operating capabilities to deliver sustainable, profitable growth, manage risk and create shareholder value.\r\nWith that introduction, I'll now recap our Q2 results. Second quarter reported revenue for NIKE, Inc. increased 15%. On a currency-neutral basis, revenue increased 18% as the NIKE Brand grew 17% and Converse increased 24%. Also on a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand futures orders grew 11%, driven by a 6% increase in average selling price and a 5% increase in units. The growth reflects continued strong demand for the NIKE Brand even as we anniversary robust prior year orders for Global Football product in advance of the 2014 World Cup. Excluding Global Football, total futures order growth this quarter was essentially in line with the numbers we reported last quarter. Specifically, this quarter's futures growth was led by double-digit expansion in North America, Europe and Greater China, with strong demand across multiple categories, including Sportswear, Basketball and Running. On a reported basis, futures grew 7%, reflecting weaker international currencies, particularly the euro, Argentine peso, ruble and yen.\r\nSecond quarter diluted EPS increased 25% to $0.74, driven by strong revenue growth, gross margin expansion and a lower share count, partially offset by higher SG&A investments.\r\nGross margin expanded 120 basis points in the quarter. The increase was driven by a mix shift to higher-margin products, continued growth in our higher-margin DTC business and a modest benefit from FX, partially offset by higher product input costs.\r\nSecond quarter demand creation spending increased 11%, driven by digital brand marketing, sports marketing and consumer events around the globe.\r\nQ2 operating overhead increased 19%, reflecting growth in our higher gross margin and higher cost DTC business, targeted investments in operational infrastructure and continued investments in digital, including consumer engagement.\r\nThe Q2 effective tax rate was 25.4%, a 20 basis point increase, primarily due to adjustments to tax expense on intercompany transactions and the benefit realized in the prior period from the U.S. R&D tax credit. These items were partially offset by an increase in earnings from operations outside the U.S, which are generally subject to a lower tax rate and the resolution of tax audits across multiple jurisdictions.\r\nInventories at November 30 were up 11% and remain healthy overall, with the majority of the growth in North America, Europe and Converse, and driven in part by the expansion of our DTC business. We continue to focus on inventory management, with particular attention on Brazil and Mexico, where we're working to balance supply and demand to position those markets for ongoing growth.\r\nNow let's take a look at some performance highlights by segment. In North America, Q2 revenue increased 16% on both a reported and currency-neutral basis, led by double-digit growth in the Basketball, Sportswear, Men's Training and Women's Training categories. Direct-to-Consumer revenues grew 18%, driven by 8% comp store sales growth, continued strong growth of NIKE.com and new stores. On a reported basis, Q2 EBIT for North America grew 21%, driven by revenue growth and gross margin expansion.\r\nIn Western Europe, Q2 revenues increased 24% on a currency-neutral basis. The growth was broad-based as every territory increased at a double digit rate. Every key category also grew, led by double digit growth for Sportswear, Football and Running.\r\nOn a reported basis, Q2 revenue for Western Europe increased 22%. Second quarter EBIT increased 112%, driven primarily by strong revenue growth, gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage. EBIT growth for Western Europe also benefited from 2 nonoperating items: a legal charge included in last year's Q2 results; and more favorable, standardized exchange rates that we use for our geography segment reporting. The latter upside was largely offset within the corporate segment of our consolidated results.\r\nRevenue in Central and Eastern Europe accelerated in the quarter, expanding 25% on a currency-neutral basis. Excluding Israel, every territory reported double digit revenue growth, and every key category expanded, except Action Sports. Despite strong FX headwinds, reported revenue for CEE grew 17%, and EBIT grew 19%, driven by strong revenue growth and SG&A leverage.\r\nIn Greater China, currency-neutral and reported revenue grew 21%, led by double digit growth in Sportswear, Running and Basketball. As Trevor discussed, the NIKE Brand continues to lead the market, and we're pleased with the results of our work to reset the marketplace for a sustainable, profitable growth. On a reported basis, Q2 EBIT in Greater China increased 31%, driven by strong revenue growth and significant gross margin expansion, partially offset by increased investments in DTC and our new Shanghai campus. Given the continuing benefits of our strategy to reset the market, we now expect full year FY '15 revenue in China to grow at a mid-teens rate.\r\nIn the emerging markets geography, Q2 revenue grew 13% on a currency-neutral basis, as all territories except Mexico and Korea posted higher revenues. From a category perspective, the growth was led by Sportswear, Basketball and Running. Reported Q2 results in the emerging markets geography reflected the translation and gross margin impact of strong FX headwinds, as reported revenue increased only 4% and EBIT decreased 3%. The reduction in profitability was primarily due to lower gross margin and higher operating overhead for new retail stores. We continue to be confident in the long-term growth potential of the territories that comprise our emerging markets geography. And as Trevor discussed earlier, we're executing plans in each of them to realize that potential.\r\nFor Converse, revenue grew 24% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by continued strength in existing direct distribution markets such as the U.S, the growth of DTC and market conversions in Europe and Asia. On a reported basis, revenue increased 21%, but EBIT decreased 12%, driven by investments in infrastructure, demand creation and DTC to enable long-term growth. \r\nOver the last 90 days, we've seen our business performance accelerate, and we expect that trend to continue into the second half of fiscal '15. At the same time, the dollar has strengthened against most other currencies and the FX markets have been extremely volatile. While our trading company structure and hedge programs do protect us from some of that volatility, we cannot entirely eliminate all FX risk.\r\nBased on what we know today, we expect the net impact of these 2 factors, the strengthening currency-neutral business performance and the downside from the stronger dollar, will net together to deliver full year results largely in line with the expectations we shared 90 days ago. Specifically, for Q3, we expect constant dollar revenue growth in the low teens, with reported revenue growth about 3 points lower, reflecting the stronger dollar. For the full year, we expect constant dollar revenue growth in the low double digits, with reported revenue growth 2 to 3 points lower. \r\nWe expect gross margin for Q3 to expand by about 100 basis points. Growth in our higher-margin businesses including DTC and strategies to increase average selling prices will continue into the second half of the year. These benefits will help to offset increases in product input costs, our actions to clear excess inventory in the emerging markets and increased FX pressure. For the full year, we now expect gross margin expansion of 100 to 125 basis points. \r\nWe expect demand creation to grow at a high-single to low double-digit rate for Q3 and at a high single-digit rate for the full year. Operating overhead is now expected to grow at a high-teens rate for Q3 and the full year, reflecting higher variable DTC expenses as well as investments in digital innovation, new operating capabilities and expanded capacity. We continue to expect the effective tax rate for FY '15 will be approximately 24.5%.\r\nAs you've heard from all 3 of us today, we're pleased with the results we delivered in the first half of FY '15 and the momentum we see in our business. And notwithstanding the volatility we've seen recently in the macro environment, we're confident we're on track to deliver strong growth for this fiscal year.\r\nWe're now ready to take your questions.",
      "transcript_text3": "I just really wanted to ask a follow-up question on the gross margin line, Don. Still great expansion year-over-year. I think, maybe you missed your projection for the second quarter a little bit. Kind of wondering, what are the swing factors quarter-to-quarter near-term? Is it FX and input costs? And then, if those are the 2 big factors, we can see FX, but how should we be thinking about oil and some of the other input costs that go in there?\n\n---\n\nWell, first of all, we gave a range on gross margin, and our actual results were really essentially in line with that range. And as we've talked about before, there's a lot of moving parts in gross margin. As we look forward with gross margin, FX is one of the things that's changing between the second quarter and where we expect the third quarter to be. As I said in my prepared remarks, we had a very small FX upside in Q2, basically because of our hedge positions for FY '15 Q3. So next quarter, we are expecting that to start turning into a headwind. So yes, FX is the major driver. When you look at the underlying fundamentals of gross selling price improvements versus input costs, we're continuing to make great progress from an operating standpoint on expanding margins.\n\n---\n\nActually, 2 questions. Don, you called out in gross margin, one of the drivers is mix shift to higher-margin products. Can you get some insight into are you speaking about higher margins on some of the new apparel you're doing? Or is it certain sneaker styles? What type of products are you mix shifting towards? And the second question was, I might have missed it, but you guys called out a lot of great things with momentum. But I don't remember hearing Nike Free or the word of Flyknit or Running in the U.S., and I just wanted to double check if I maybe missed something on one of those 3 things.\n\n---\n\nSure. So on your first question, this is a trend that we've seen for quite a while now, which is that with the strength of our brand and the flow of innovation we have into the marketplace, we have been essentially trading the consumer up to premium product, and that's both on the apparel and the footwear side. So it's things like Tech Fleece on the sportswear front and apparel or just generally the performance apparel we've seen in Running as well as a number of other performance categories. And on the footwear side, it's marquee footwear styles, Running, Basketball, Sportswear. So what this is, is that long-term trend to building product that's premium for the consumer and can carry that price premium. And I'm going to hand the second question off to Trevor.\n\n---\n\nYes, I'll jump in there. On -- obviously, as you -- as we go through the results, there's a number of categories and dimension of the business. So we always try and give you maybe just some different flavors to how the business is doing. So maybe speaking specifically about Running, we feel good about the Running category. It's our biggest category. It's what we always described as we really operate at complete offense. When you -- in terms of growth, for the quarter, we actually saw mid to high single-digit paced growth in the second quarter. In terms of the growth, it was actually pretty widespread. We saw a particular strength in Europe as well as in China, in Europe, both dimensions of Europe, so Central and Eastern Europe as well as Western Europe. When you dive down specifically into North America, what we have been seeing, it's really across the board, our premium products are doing exceptionally well across the marketplace. And so all the premium products, whether it's the structure, the Pegasus, the LunarGlide, those are all doing really well. Where we have opportunity is really more in the lower price points, and we are actively working to get onto that. And so we are bringing better products in the marketplace, and we will be doing that. So all in all, we feel very good about our Running business across the board. But clearly, there's some opportunity for us to continue to make sure we sharpen our focus along the lines of the complete offense.\n\n---\n\nAs far as the Free and Flyknit innovation from Nike, the -- as I said before, and I continue to be very bullish on both those areas of our innovation agenda, we have -- I recently spent time in our advanced R&D looking at some of the new concepts coming down the pike here, some sooner than later, very exciting developments in the Free category as well as Flyknit, and we continue to be as bullish as we ever have been on the potential as far as both those areas are concerned.\n\n---\n\nI guess, I have 2 questions. The first one is, I think, the China growth figure now are looking for mid-teens. I think, that's an improvement from the prior outlook. And I just wondered if you could elaborate a little bit more in terms of what's developing there, how everything is going on the footwear side and the apparel side?\n\n---\n\nYes, great question, obviously. As we've always been talking about, we would do -- we even put a reset strategy in China, and we feel very confident that the reset strategy is working. As you could see, certainly with a growth of 21%, we felt great about that result. We also see futures continue to up 13% as a very good indication that all our strategies are in place, and we're building them into the fundamentals of the business. And so as you remember, the key to the strategy was making sure that we would drive more profitable and productive retail. And so we're seeing both of those dimensions really hit. Both were actually increasing the sell-through of products, but it's also at a much more profitable rate. So we feel that we're actually doing all the things that we've talked about. We feel very good about the continued trend on the China business. The metrics continue to show that when you look into our specific -- working with our partners, their doors continue to profile really well. So again, we feel very good. And the inventories in the marketplace are very clean. So all the dimensions of those business will suggest that we will continue to see continuing strong growth in China.\n\n---\n\nAnd I'll just add that the strength of the brand in China is tremendous. The response of the product that we've introduced is also quite strong. We've obviously made measures to increase our productivity at retail and we're leveraging that across both our own doors and our partner doors in China. So we're very excited about all of that. And then, as Trevor said, the inventory situation there is actually quite good. So we're bullish on the opportunity. And I'll mention, too, that we just launched .com here less than about 7 months ago in China, the response there is -- exceeded our expectations. So that's another great opportunity for us.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And then, I just have a quick follow-up question. Can you just elaborate on the plan? As you think about FY '15 versus next year, how are you guys going to comp against the success that the Ducks have had and the Heisman Trophy winner from the University of Oregon?\n\n---\n\nThat's a good one. That's a tough one to beat. Yes, we're very excited about the Football Championships, and we're very happy for whichever NIKE team wins.\n\n---\n\nIt seems as if every other global consumer products company is complaining about a very challenging macro dynamic. Outside of the currency issues that you guys highlighted, are there any markets where you're starting to see the second derivatives turn a little bit softer, where you feel a little bit more cautious about or some disconnect between sell-in and sell-through? Or is your performance as good as it seems?\n\n---\n\nWhen you say second derivatives, you mean just overall consumer trends?\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nYes, well, one of the things I'd say, just as an opening, is, generally, what we found is our product and our brand are really the keys to how successful we are in a lot of these markets. And as long as we don't see huge moves in the macroeconomics, we believe that we can continue to generate growth in the business. And we've generally seen that to be the case around the world. There are a few places where we've seen some of the macro start to, at least in the near term, affect consumer confidence. Brazil is an example of that. Certainly, we think, over time, we've got to keep a close eye on Russia. But generally, what we found is our product is one of those things that consumers find ways to continue to buy. And as long as we keep the brand hot and the product right and the distribution premium, I think, we'll do fine.\n\n---\n\nYes, maybe just a jump in there, too. I would say that we also believe that with the category offense, it provides us the ability to continue to bring innovation on multiple dimensions all the time. And that's what we're seeing in many of the marketplaces. So we have been able to somewhat, so to speak, buck the trend. Having said that, Brazil is clearly one of the markets that we're continuing to work on to make sure that we stay ahead of that curve. And that's what we're working to accelerate the marketplace and make sure that we continue to implement our category offense more aggressively in that market.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And you've talked about a strategy to take sort of ongoing inflationary price increases to offset what you have believed was sort of input cost inflation for an extended horizon. Has the move in commodity markets changed your view on pricing going forward?\n\n---\n\nWell, let me wind back to the first part of that question. We actually are not pricing literally with either inflation or input cost. One of the changes that we made over the last 5 years or so is really focusing on the consumer as we set price. And really, it's about the value equation that we're trying to create with the consumer. And so when we bring innovation and brand strength and premium presentation at retail to the consumer, then you can move the consumer to premium prices. So we will obviously keep a very close eye on the consumer value equation. We are managing our entire P&L, including margins and costs and revenue and so on. And so, yes, it's part of the calculus, but our pricing is really focused on maintaining the right consumer value equation of the marketplace.\n\n---\n\nQuestion for you, Trevor. Visiting a number of the stores recently, the premiumization of the apparel is very evident. It also appears that the apparel collection is more tightly edited than in the past. Is that accurate? And can you also comment on the impact that you've seen on apparel conversion in your Direct-to-Consumer with that directional change?\n\n---\n\nYes. No, I think, you're pretty astute because, absolutely, that is what is taking place, I think, on multiple dimensions, for instance, if you break into our apparel business and you break it out by segment, certainly, you go by the women's business, our apparel business is doing very, very well. We've tightened the collections down. We've made sure that they actually work across the line. So we've seen really good, strong conversions. Our apparel business within our own doors does exceptionally well. Our Sportswear business, as an example, of the Tech Pack, which we think is a great item and collection actually that's working across the business. So we're seeing strong conversion across. And one of the things that we are learning, which is by -- I think, Mark has always talked about this, which is by being a better retailer, we actually are better with our wholesale partners. So we're taking that same knowledge of tightening the assortments and making sure that we apply that in the broader marketplace. And so we think that's actually what's driving the great growth that we're seeing.\n\n---\n\nAnd I will say, looking forward to -- we're known for our footwear innovation. We're actually accelerating our commitment to innovation in apparel. And that's really where we're going to shine, I think, is to continue to really stand out from a performance premium apparel position and then leverage that across what we talked about as our complete offense. And we've done that and where we done it, where we've really gotten a lead on that, we've seen the consumer response has been actually quite positive. So as an innovation geek, product geek, I'm incredibly excited about applying that even more aggressively to the apparel side of our business.\n\n---\n\nSo just some interesting comments in the beginning, you were talking about how you see a big apparel opportunity i.e., you're investing in the Nike Women's business and you're seeing incredible momentum there. At the end of last year, the men's business was almost 3x as big as the women's business. So if you think about it from a big picture perspective, what's the opportunity to close that gap over time given the momentum you're seeing, given the investments you're making? And can you talk about maybe some structural reasons why the gap can't be the same eventually?\n\n---\n\nWell, the opportunity, we spoke -- I spoke to a little bit in my remarks, we're seeing a big shift in women's just in terms of their participation in sports and being more physical. We're seeing that online with the number of women we have participating in our Nike+ and our training applications online. So the relationship we have with the women and the trend that we're seeing, it's not really trend, it's, as I call it, it's more of a cultural shift. So the appetite is there for more active product and we're seeing that in both footwear and apparel. So the opportunity to really start to close that gap is tremendous. And we think that over the years ahead, we'll start to reduce that differentiation between NIKE as a percentage -- or I'm sorry, men's as a percentage of NIKE's business versus women. So very, very bullish on the women's opportunity and the response to the work that we've already done in elevating that part of our product and our communication.\n\n---\n\nYes, and I think, as Mark just touched on, I think, it really speaks to why we think women's is such a big and huge opportunity for us and why we're very focused on that. And I said, we believe we are absolutely on target to go after a $7 billion goal for fiscal year '17. But we truly believe it's not about that, it's actually about beyond, continuing to really move the needle around our women's business.\n\n---\n\nJust quickly on the China business. It's interesting because you guys usually give a fairly detailed report card as you started to really go into the active mode of repairing that business. Maybe we look at just where we are in that business now as far you were controlling inventories for a long time, working with retailers to improve the presentation in retail and put some CapEx into those stores. And I guess, numerically, it's very interesting to see 20% revenue growth off 6% futures. And now that you've accelerated the futures to 13%, how do we think about that spread going forward without getting too carried away on what we can look at? It certainly doesn't point me intuitively to a mid-teens revenue growth for the year. So just any help there would be great.\n\n---\n\nYes, I think, first of all, you're right. In the previous quarters, we were giving you a pretty detailed articulation. One of the things we said was that because of the prior year comparisons, the futures growth rate, the revenue growth rates were not going to look all that obvious or all that intuitive. So that's why gave much more specific guidance on that market than we normally do. And once again, this quarter, we gave revenue guidance of mid-teens growth for the year because it is a little hard to read the futures and the revenue growth just because of the prior year. Once we get past this fiscal year, we're going to start to be anniversarying numbers that are a little more consistent and we can go back to fairly normal relationships between futures and revenue. But for right now, what we would ask that you do is pay attention to what it is we give you as future guidance. That is our best estimate of where we think the revenue numbers would be. You're still going to see some unusual relationships between futures and revenue for a few more quarters.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then, if I could just ask one more question on the gross margins. Obviously, the nuances of gross margin, we've talked about a bit on this call. But as we visited over the last few years, the topic always comes up of when you guys can get back to the prior peak gross margins of just over 46%. And we heard you talk a lot about premiumization and clearly worked very hard on that line in the P&L. Do you think, at this point, that the work you guys have done on product, on manufacturing and on the focus on pricing, we've reset the bar a long term for the grosses to be able to go over that level longer term?\n\n---\n\nYes, we don't necessarily see there as being a ceiling on gross margin. As I said earlier on in response to the pricing question, this is really about creating the equity in the brand and the product and how we distribute it that enables us to be premium and get paid for our work. And we believe that we have opportunities in terms of the revenue portion of the equation as we continue to drive that value equation behind the innovation in the brand. On the cost side, we've talked about some of the things we're doing in the manufacturing space. We've talked about just getting better and better at how we flow product and we continue to see opportunities there. So we don't see that previous peak as somehow a magical ceiling. As I said in my earlier remarks, it's a signpost on the journey, but we believe that we can continue to create that value in the margin equation.\n\n---\n\nI guess, if I could touch on digital and e-com, obviously, a couple of quarters now, pretty significant acceleration. Maybe just touch on again the consumer migration, the evolution of that channel overall, obviously a massive opportunity. But how you think about sort of expanding the market versus cannibalizing it and how you sort of maintain the relationships in balance with your wholesale partners?\n\n---\n\nWell, yes, good question. First of all, I'd say that our commitment to DTC or Direct-to-Consumer business is a huge and critical part of the commitment we have to create a more premium presentation for our brands and our products and ultimately giving our customers, consumers, a better experience all around. So with that said, the world is changing. Consumer behavior and expectations are certainly changing. More people, no mystery to anybody here, are shopping online. They want products easy. They want it fast. They want to be able to customize and personalize, shop on their devices and an in-store setting. So the relationship between those channels is really critical whether it's NIKE direct or with our retail partners. And that's really the focus of our marketplace development work is to really assess how all the parts or channels actually work together and work together in a way that really give the consumer the best experience. So we're really focused on how do we address the needs and expectation of the of the consumer. And as we say, they ultimately decide. So NIKE, I think, you've seen, along with our retail partners, is expanding the market, and we're seeing more positive results all around. We think this is a win-win situation between NIKE and our wholesale partners around the world, and that's exactly what we're seeing. Trevor mentioned, and we've said this quite regularly, being a better retailer is making us a better company and a better wholesale partner. NIKE.com, as bullish as we are, it's a -- and as positive as the results have been, which are pretty spectacular, is still in the early stages. We're investing heavily. This is one of the bigger growth opportunities for us long term, big improvements in just how the consumer interacts with Nike online, seamless card experiences, making the transactions a lot easier, actually blurring the lines between transacting online and in-store. Supply chain improvements, improvements in ID, I could go on. Increased focus on mobile, very, very important for us. So the investment and the focus on this area will continue and not as a separate, isolated part of NIKE but as an integrated part of our business and our categories. So I'll just say we're obviously quite bullish on this and this is where the consumer is going and this is where we'll be.\n\n---\n\nAll right. Well, with that, we want to thank everyone for joining us. Happy holidays, everybody, and we'll talk to you next quarter.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Omar Saad (Analysts)】\nI just really wanted to ask a follow-up question on the gross margin line, Don. Still great expansion year-over-year. I think, maybe you missed your projection for the second quarter a little bit. Kind of wondering, what are the swing factors quarter-to-quarter near-term? Is it FX and input costs? And then, if those are the 2 big factors, we can see FX, but how should we be thinking about oil and some of the other input costs that go in there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Donald Blair (Executives)】\nWell, first of all, we gave a range on gross margin, and our actual results were really essentially in line with that range. And as we've talked about before, there's a lot of moving parts in gross margin. As we look forward with gross margin, FX is one of the things that's changing between the second quarter and where we expect the third quarter to be. As I said in my prepared remarks, we had a very small FX upside in Q2, basically because of our hedge positions for FY '15 Q3. So next quarter, we are expecting that to start turning into a headwind. So yes, FX is the major driver. When you look at the underlying fundamentals of gross selling price improvements versus input costs, we're continuing to make great progress from an operating standpoint on expanding margins.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Ohmes (Analysts)】\nActually, 2 questions. Don, you called out in gross margin, one of the drivers is mix shift to higher-margin products. Can you get some insight into are you speaking about higher margins on some of the new apparel you're doing? Or is it certain sneaker styles? What type of products are you mix shifting towards? And the second question was, I might have missed it, but you guys called out a lot of great things with momentum. But I don't remember hearing Nike Free or the word of Flyknit or Running in the U.S., and I just wanted to double check if I maybe missed something on one of those 3 things.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Donald Blair (Executives)】\nSure. So on your first question, this is a trend that we've seen for quite a while now, which is that with the strength of our brand and the flow of innovation we have into the marketplace, we have been essentially trading the consumer up to premium product, and that's both on the apparel and the footwear side. So it's things like Tech Fleece on the sportswear front and apparel or just generally the performance apparel we've seen in Running as well as a number of other performance categories. And on the footwear side, it's marquee footwear styles, Running, Basketball, Sportswear.

And I'm going to hand the second question off to Trevor.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Trevor Edwards (Executives)】\nYes, I'll jump in there. On -- obviously, as you -- as we go through the results, there's a number of categories and dimension of the business. So we always try and give you maybe just some different flavors to how the business is doing. So maybe speaking specifically about Running, we feel good about the Running category. It's our biggest category. It's what we always described as we really operate at complete offense. When you -- in terms of growth, for the quarter, we actually saw mid to high single-digit paced growth in the second quarter. In terms of the growth, it was actually pretty widespread.

So all in all, we feel very good about our Running business across the board. But clearly, there's some opportunity for us to continue to make sure we sharpen our focus along the lines of the complete offense.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Parker (Executives)】\nAs far as the Free and Flyknit innovation from Nike, the -- as I said before, and I continue to be very bullish on both those areas of our innovation agenda, we have -- I recently spent time in our advanced R&D looking at some of the new concepts coming down the pike here, some sooner than later, very exciting developments in the Free category as well as Flyknit, and we continue to be as bullish as we ever have been on the potential as far as both those areas are concerned.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Drbul (Analysts)】\nI guess, I have 2 questions.

So the relationship we have with the women and the trend that we're seeing, it's not really trend, it's, as I call it, it's more of a cultural shift. So the appetite is there for more active product and we're seeing that in both footwear and apparel. So the opportunity to really start to close that gap is tremendous. And we think that over the years ahead, we'll start to reduce that differentiation between NIKE as a percentage -- or I'm sorry, men's as a percentage of NIKE's business versus women. So very, very bullish on the women's opportunity and the response to the work that we've already done in elevating that part of our product and our communication.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Trevor Edwards (Executives)】\nYes, and I think, as Mark just touched on, I think, it really speaks to why we think women's is such a big and huge opportunity for us and why we're very focused on that. And I said, we believe we are absolutely on target to go after a $7 billion goal for fiscal year '17. But we truly believe it's not about that, it's actually about beyond, continuing to really move the needle around our women's business.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Binetti (Analysts)】\nJust quickly on the China business. It's interesting because you guys usually give a fairly detailed report card as you started to really go into the active mode of repairing that business. Maybe we look at just where we are in that business now as far you were controlling inventories for a long time, working with retailers to improve the presentation in retail and put some CapEx into those stores. And I guess, numerically, it's very interesting to see 20% revenue growth off 6% futures. And now that you've accelerated the futures to 13%, how do we think about that spread going forward without getting too carried away on what we can look at? It certainly doesn't point me intuitively to a mid-teens revenue growth for the year. So just any help there would be great.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Donald Blair (Executives)】\nYes, I think, first of all, you're right. In the previous quarters, we were giving you a pretty detailed articulation. One of the things we said was that because of the prior year comparisons, the futures growth rate, the revenue growth rates were not going to look all that obvious or all that intuitive. So that's why gave much more specific guidance on that market than we normally do. And once again, this quarter, we gave revenue guidance of mid-teens growth for the year because it is a little hard to read the futures and the revenue growth just because of the prior year. Once we get past this fiscal year, we're going to start to be anniversarying numbers that are a little more consistent and we can go back to fairly normal relationships between futures and revenue. But for right now, what we would ask that you do is pay attention to what it is we give you as future guidance. That is our best estimate of where we think the revenue numbers would be. You're still going to see some unusual relationships between futures and revenue for a few more quarters.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Binetti (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then, if I could just ask one more question on the gross margins. Obviously, the nuances of gross margin, we've talked about a bit on this call. But as we visited over the last few years, the topic always comes up of when you guys can get back to the prior peak gross margins of just over 46%. And we heard you talk a lot about premiumization and clearly worked very hard on that line in the P&L. Do you think, at this point, that the work you guys have done on product, on manufacturing and on the focus on pricing, we've reset the bar a long term for the grosses to be able to go over that level longer term?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Donald Blair (Executives)】\nYes, we don't necessarily see there as being a ceiling on gross margin. As I said earlier on in response to the pricing question, this is really about creating the equity in the brand and the product and how we distribute it that enables us to be premium and get paid for our work. And we believe that we have opportunities in terms of the revenue portion of the equation as we continue to drive that value equation behind the innovation in the brand. On the cost side, we've talked about some of the things we're doing in the manufacturing space. We've talked about just getting better and better at how we flow product and we continue to see opportunities there. So we don't see that previous peak as somehow a magical ceiling. As I said in my earlier remarks, it's a signpost on the journey, but we believe that we can continue to create that value in the margin equation.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Eric Tracy (Analysts)】\nI guess, if I could touch on digital and e-com, obviously, a couple of quarters now, pretty significant acceleration. Maybe just touch on again the consumer migration, the evolution of that channel overall, obviously a massive opportunity. But how you think about sort of expanding the market versus cannibalizing it and how you sort of maintain the relationships in balance with your wholesale partners?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Parker (Executives)】\nWell, yes, good question. First of all, I'd say that our commitment to DTC or Direct-to-Consumer business is a huge and critical part of the commitment we have to create a more premium presentation for our brands and our products and ultimately giving our customers, consumers, a better experience all around. So with that said, the world is changing. Consumer behavior and expectations are certainly changing. More people, no mystery to anybody here, are shopping online. They want products easy. They want it fast. They want to be able to customize and personalize, shop on their devices and an in-store setting. So the relationship between those channels is really critical whether it's NIKE direct or with our retail partners. And that's really the focus of our marketplace development work is to really assess how all the parts or channels actually work together and work together in a way that really give the consumer the best experience. So we're really focused on how do we address the needs and expectation of the of the consumer. And as we say, they ultimately decide. So NIKE, I think, you've seen, along with our retail partners, is expanding the market, and we're seeing more positive results all around. We think this is a win-win situation between NIKE and our wholesale partners around the world, and that's exactly what we're seeing. Trevor mentioned, and we've said this quite regularly, being a better retailer is making us a better company and a better wholesale partner. NIKE.com, as bullish as we are, it's a -- and as positive as the results have been, which are pretty spectacular, is still in the early stages. We're investing heavily. This is one of the bigger growth opportunities for us long term, big improvements in just how the consumer interacts with Nike online, seamless card experiences, making the transactions a lot easier, actually blurring the lines between transacting online and in-store. Supply chain improvements, improvements in ID, I could go on. Increased focus on mobile, very, very important for us. So the investment and the focus on this area will continue and not as a separate, isolated part of NIKE but as an integrated part of our business and our categories. So I'll just say we're obviously quite bullish on this and this is where the consumer is going and this is where we'll be.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kelley Hall (Executives)】\nAll right. Well, with that, we want to thank everyone for joining us. Happy holidays, everybody, and we'll talk to you next quarter.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle's Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information, can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website.\r\nOn the call today are Executive Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison; and CEOs Safra Catz and Mark Hurd. As a reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward looking.\r\nThroughout today's discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business, which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements being made today. \r\nAs a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, and we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments, for a complete discussion of these factors and any other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock.\r\nAnd finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or publicly release any revision to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. \r\nBefore taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Ken. I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q2. I'll then review guidance for Q3, and turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments. \r\nClearly, we are very pleased with our results, as hardware and total revenue were both above my CD guidance, while total software was up at the high end. Cloud grew 47%, on-premise, software license and support grew 6%, hardware systems grew 4% and total revenue grew 7% in constant currency. The as-reported numbers were heavily impacted by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in comparison to other currencies. Total revenue saw a 4% currency headwind, which was double what it was at the time of my guidance. \r\nSoftware and cloud, as well as hardware systems, saw growth rates affected by 3%. Currencies continue to move significantly, so my comments today are generally going to reflect constant dollar growth rates. \r\nTotal cloud revenue was $519 million, growing 47%, with cloud, SaaS and PaaS revenue of $364 million, up 41% from last year and more than double last year's growth. The cloud bookings momentum of several quarters is now helping drive SaaS and PaaS revenue growth. When bookings turn into revenue depends on many factors, but as I review the numbers over the last few quarters, one thing is clear: the acceleration in the business bodes very well for our future. Cloud Infrastructure as a Service revenue was $155 million, up 62%, but due in part to prior year compares being low.\r\nOverall, our cloud results were better than expected, as we're clearly growing faster than Salesforce, and we're more than 3x the size of Workday. Our goal remains to be bigger and grow faster in the cloud than both companies, while improving our already high levels of profitability. \r\nTotal software revenues were $7.3 billion, up 8% from last year. Software updates and product support revenues drove nearly half of total company revenue at $4.8 billion, up 9% from last year. Attach and renewal rates remain at their usual high levels, as our growing install base of customers continue to power earnings and cash flow. New software licensed revenues were $2 billion. \r\nLooking at GAAP Software and cloud results by region, the Americas grew 8%, with North America database growing double digits and very strong cloud growth. EMEA grew 9%, with cloud growth of more than 80%, and Asia Pacific grew 7%, powered by Japan. Overall, the hardware business, including hardware support, grew 4%, with hardware system product revenue of $717 million and hardware support revenue of $619 million. \r\nOur Engineered Systems saw solid growth, with particular strength in both Exalogic and Big Data Appliance as we continue to gain share. For the company, total revenue for the quarter was $9.6 billion, up 7% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.4 billion, also up 7% from last year. And the operating margin was unchanged at 46%. \r\nExcluding MICROS, both hardware gross margin and operating margin expanded by more than 1%, that we're able to maintain our industry-leading operating margins with MICROS now part of the business, while growing our cloud business 47%, is a testimony to the strength of our business model. \r\nNon-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 24.3%. It was higher than my guidance of 23%, and EPS was $0.69 in U.S. dollars. GAAP tax rate was 23.5%, a point higher than my guidance. GAAP EPS for the quarter was USD 0.56. The higher tax rate reduced EPS for both GAAP and non-GAAP by $0.01. This was a result of revenue mix by region, driven primarily by foreign currency impact and a couple of other small factors. \r\nFree cash flow over the last 4 quarters is down very slightly at $14.5 billion, as we increased CapEx spending a little bit. Just so that you get a sense of the size here, CapEx spending over the last 4 quarters is about $150 million higher than that same 4 quarters the previous year. \r\nWe now have nearly $45 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is approximately $12 billion. As we've said before, we are committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and the dividend. \r\nIn terms of acquisitions, we continue to focus on finding the right companies at the right valuations and both are critically important. This quarter, we repurchased 52.8 million shares for a total of $2.1 billion. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased more than 200 million shares for a total of $8.1 billion, paid out dividends of $2.1 billion for a total that is more than 70% of our free cash flow. The Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share.\r\nNow to the guidance. As you can imagine, we feel very good about our prospects and our performance. So I have to tell you, I'm always keeping an eye on the situation in the macro environment, especially abroad. Additionally, given the unusually high volatility in exchange rates, we expect currency will affect revenue by more than 4% and EPS by $0.04 if rates stay as they did -- as they are just about now. But as we just don't know how much, I'm going to provide constant currency guidance today.\r\nSaaS and PaaS, on a non-GAAP basis, is expected to grow 30% to 34% in constant currency. On a GAAP basis, SaaS and PaaS revenue is expected to grow 31% to 35%. Cloud IaaS on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis is expected to grow 29% to 33%. Software and cloud revenue on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, including SaaS and PaaS and IaaS, new software license and software support, is expected to grow between 5% to 8%. \r\nHardware system revenue on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, which includes hardware system products and hardware system support, is expected to be somewhere between negative 2% and positive 8% in constant currency. Total revenue growth on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 4% to 8%. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be somewhere between $0.69 and $0.74. Again, all of this in constant currency. GAAP EPS is expected to be somewhere between $0.55 and $0.60.\r\nNow this guidance assumes a GAAP tax rate of 23% and a non-GAAP tax rate of 24%, but this too may end up being different, especially as tax rate is very heavily impacted by the mix of earnings, which is impacted by currency.\r\nWith that, I'm going to turn this over to Larry, for his comments.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Safra. As Oracle's cloud business gets bigger, our growth rate is going up. As our competitors' cloud businesses get bigger, their growth rates are going down. This has big implications. I'd like to explain.\r\nIn Q2, we booked more than $170 million in new SaaS and PaaS, annually recurring revenue or ARR. In other words, we sold over $170 million of new SaaS and PaaS annual subscription this past quarter. \r\nIn Q4 of this fiscal year, we expect to sell more than $250 million of new annual SaaS and PaaS subscriptions. That means, during our next fiscal year, we will sell well over $1 billion of new SaaS and PaaS annual subscriptions. \r\nWhat makes this particularly interesting, is that next year, Oracle will sell about the same total dollar amount of new SaaS and PaaS business as cloud market leader Salesforce.com. Stay tuned. It's going to be close. We're catching up to them, and we're catching up very quickly. \r\nMark, over to you.\n\n---\n\nThank you. Okay. Let me just give you a couple of numbers and a few names, and then we'll go to your questions. SaaS, PaaS revenue, as Safra mentioned, grew 41% in CD. ERP EPM revenue grew more than 80%. CX revenue grew nearly 50%. I think that company Larry mentioned, Salesforce.com, reported 28%. \r\nCX marketing automation grew 200% in revenue. Bookings grew nearly 150%. I want to say one more time, it was 150%. Fusion bookings, ERP, HCM and Salesforce automation all grew triple digits. All pillars saw booking growth in excess of 50%. \r\nWe added more than 860 SaaS customers, with more than 230 have subscribed to more than one pillar when they bought a cloud subscription from us. Nearly 650 existing customers expanded their cloud services in the quarter. \r\nIn HCM, we added 230 new customers. In CX, more than 460 new customers. In ERP EPM, 250 new customers. In one quarter, we added 2.5x Workday's entire install base. Nearly 150 of the new ERP customers did not have any Oracle ERP before they bought cloud subscription from Oracle in the quarter. \r\nOverall, Fusion had triple-digit bookings growth, triple-digit revenue growth. We have over 125 go-lives in Q2, that's SaaS. In PaaS, we had a breakout quarter. We had 150 brand new PaaS customers. As many of you know, we announced PaaS at Oracle Open World, the end of September. 3/4 subscribed to multiple PaaS services. The PaaS opportunity is big, given the size of our installed base, and you might argue as big or bigger than the SaaS opportunity. \r\nLet me read you a few names from the quarter: NHR, Fidelity National Financial, Pella, Siemens, Barnes & Noble, Baylor Health Care System, DIRECTV, Honeywell, Johnson & Johnson, Kaiser, Nokia, Northrop Grumman, Societe Generale, Skanska. \r\nAnd Sales service cloud: Flowserve, 3M, Adidas, Equifax, DIRECTV, Fiat, TELUS, United Parcel Service, Visa, Yahoo!, Big Sur, Cypress Semiconductor. \r\nIn marketing cloud: Bloomberg, Equifax, Fiat, Honeywell, RECO, Siemens, Telefonica, Visa, Emerson, Kroger, LEGO Systems. \r\nIn the ERP EPM cloud: Odebrecht in Brazil, H.J. Heinz, InBev, Lafarge, Michael Fricker [ph], and I don't have more time to read more. These are a huge list of logos that we gained in the quarter. \r\nA couple of other comments. Premise software grew 6% in CD. I continue to expect this business to grow nicely, while our cloud continues to maintain hyper growth. \r\nMoving quickly just to mention hardware. Engineered Systems bookings grew double digits. Bookings for Exalogic, SuperCluster and Big Data Appliance, to Safra's point, all grew more than 50%. And I just want to make sure for those of you that don't listen to traditional hardware companies' calls, it is clear we are taking substantive market share in hardware. \r\nAnd wrapping up, our cloud revenue is already at a $2 billion rate, and I said at the Financial Analyst Meeting, our SaaS pipeline is large. Since then, it's gotten bigger. We outpaced our bookings growth plan for the first half of the year, and set our sights on 100% bookings growth for Q3. \r\nWith that, we will take your questions.",

Stay tuned. It's going to be close. We're catching up to them, and we're catching up very quickly. \r\nMark, over to you.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Mark Hurd (Executives)】\nThank you. Okay. Let me just give you a couple of numbers and a few names, and then we'll go to your questions. SaaS, PaaS revenue, as Safra mentioned, grew 41% in CD. ERP EPM revenue grew more than 80%. CX revenue grew nearly 50%. I think that company Larry mentioned, Salesforce.com, reported 28%. \r\nCX marketing automation grew 200% in revenue. Bookings grew nearly 150%. I want to say one more time, it was 150%. Fusion bookings, ERP, HCM and Salesforce automation all grew triple digits. All pillars saw booking growth in excess of 50%. \r\nWe added more than 860 SaaS customers, with more than 230 have subscribed to more than one pillar when they bought a cloud subscription from us. Nearly 650 existing customers expanded their cloud services in the quarter. \r\nIn HCM, we added 230 new customers. In CX, more than 460 new customers. In ERP EPM, 250 new customers. In one quarter, we added 2.5x Workday's entire install base. Nearly 150 of the new ERP customers did not have any Oracle ERP before they bought cloud subscription from Oracle in the quarter. \r\nOverall, Fusion had triple-digit bookings growth, triple-digit revenue growth. We have over 125 go-lives in Q2, that's SaaS. In PaaS, we had a breakout quarter. We had 150 brand new PaaS customers. As many of you know, we announced PaaS at Oracle Open World, the end of September. 3/4 subscribed to multiple PaaS services. The PaaS opportunity is big, given the size of our installed base, and you might argue as big or bigger than the SaaS opportunity. \r\nLet me read you a few names from the quarter: NHR, Fidelity National Financial, Pella, Siemens, Barnes & Noble, Baylor Health Care System, DIRECTV, Honeywell, Johnson & Johnson, Kaiser, Nokia, Northrop Grumman, Societe Generale, Skanska. \r\nAnd Sales service cloud: Flowserve, 3M, Adidas, Equifax, DIRECTV, Fiat, TELUS, United Parcel Service, Visa, Yahoo!, Big Sur, Cypress Semiconductor. \r\nIn marketing cloud: Bloomberg, Equifax, Fiat, Honeywell, RECO, Siemens, Telefonica, Visa, Emerson, Kroger, LEGO Systems. \r\nIn the ERP EPM cloud: Odebrecht in Brazil, H.J. Heinz, InBev, Lafarge, Michael Fricker [ph], and I don't have more time to read more. These are a huge list of logos that we gained in the quarter. \r\nA couple of other comments. Premise software grew 6% in CD. I continue to expect this business to grow nicely, while our cloud continues to maintain hyper growth. \r\nMoving quickly just to mention hardware. Engineered Systems bookings grew double digits. Bookings for Exalogic, SuperCluster and Big Data Appliance, to Safra's point, all grew more than 50%. And I just want to make sure for those of you that don't listen to traditional hardware companies' calls, it is clear we are taking substantive market share in hardware. \r\nAnd wrapping up, our cloud revenue is already at a $2 billion rate, and I said at the Financial Analyst Meeting, our SaaS pipeline is large. Since then, it's gotten bigger. We outpaced our bookings growth plan for the first half of the year, and set our sights on 100% bookings growth for Q3. \r\nWith that, we will take your questions.",
      "transcript_text3": "On the cloud side, I'm curious, as far as the new versus existing customers. I think we got some metric there. Can you give us a sense of are you seeing a conversion from existing on-prem customers? Or is most of this new business that you're picking up?\n\n---\n\nWell first, let's go through it by pillar, because I think that's the way you have to do it. In marketing, everything is really new. We don't have a marketing install base. So when we give you those numbers, Rick, they're really everything coming is a net new logo. Now it may be in a company that's got Oracle product, but it's all net new. Most of our Sales Cloud is net new. There is some Siebel conversion, but as I mentioned at the Financial Analyst Meeting, our Siebel install base, when you look at the support numbers, is fairly stable. So we have a lot of net new even in, if you will, Sales Cloud. We have a mix in HR, both conversion and net new. And I think the important thing you saw this quarter, as we've talked before, Rick, I think it's not just the fact that our strategy isn't the -- just best-of-breed in each of these apps, but also to have a suite of capability. That's why I wanted to mention the multi-pillar deals that occurred in Q2 because we have customers now that are not just buying ERP from us, but they're buying ERP and HR. They're buying Sales Cloud and Marketing. And we also get the opportunity, as you know, to go back into that install base once we've got one app, and sell a second app, a third app, a fourth app. And so it was an exciting quarter across a number of those metrics.\n\n---\n\nI'd just like to add -- Rick, let me just add one thing. As Mark said, you've got to take it pillar by pillar. You also have to take it layer by layer in the cloud. So where a lot of our SaaS business, our brand new logos, people who have never done business with Oracle before, you would expect that in PaaS, it's virtually all our installed base. But the reason being almost every moderate sized company in the world is already an Oracle user. So the PaaS we're selling in the installed base, as Mark said, SaaS is a bit of a mix, depending on pillar.\n\n---\n\nYes. And Larry, you're seeing customers pivoting now to PaaS and Infrastructure as a Service, if you could maybe spend a moment on that.\n\n---\n\nAgain, I think our -- what we're pushing very hard is PaaS, as opposed to Infrastructure as a Service. I mean, that's where our huge differentiation is. That's where we give you so much more automation in terms of database tuning and installation, and backup and recovery, and logging and security. So our big push is in the PaaS. We are in Infrastructure as a Service, which is a low-cost commodity business, where we have the same pricing as Amazon and Google and the rest. We're in that because when our customers come -- as far as Mark said earlier, they're buying one pillar, they'll buy another. I can talk about layers in the cloud where they'll buy a few SaaS applications, they'll buy some PaaS, and they'll buy some Infrastructure as a Service, is they want to have a unified security model and a fast network to interconnect all of these pieces.\n\n---\n\nI have 2 questions. One, I want to follow up on the cloud piece, and then a question on the database. On the cloud piece, Larry, you talked about $1 billion in bookings. I just want to make sure that I'm reading this correctly. That's an incremental $1 billion on top of your current...\n\n---\n\nYes, that's all new business -- that's another bit that we will have sold and when you annualize -- this is not total contract value. This is in terms of annual subscription rates that we will sell next fiscal year, well -- in excess. We expect to sell well in excess of $1 billion of new annual subscription.\n\n---\n\nAnd that's on top of your current...\n\n---\n\nWhich is about what Salesforce will be selling in their next fiscal year. I think, they're at $1.1 something like that as best as we can estimate, and we think we have a good chance of passing them. I don't know if we can pass them, or catch them or -- but it's getting very close. We're in that ballpark. So we're selling new business at the same rate as the market leader next year, which I think -- again, we're experiencing hyper growth. Salesforce is slowing down. We're speeding up. They're only twice as big as us. They're -- round numbers, they're $4 billion, we're $2 billion. But we're growing a lot faster, and we have a lot more products. And we have a large install base to sell into. So we think -- again, I said, I know, just words. We said we think we can become #1 in the cloud. We think we will be #1 in the cloud, and we will be #1 in the cloud very quickly.\n\n---\n\nAnd Jason, just to add to your question. I mean most of all of our comments that Larry made, that I made, we're all talking about ARR, but not TCV. So there's not a multiplier on that. Our average contract value is actually longer than annual. But we're talking in comparisons of ARR.\n\n---\n\nYes. IBM will announce a $1 billion deal over 10 years. That $1 billion deal with us would be $100 million, if it's a 10-year deal and it's evenly distributed, we would count that as $1 billion -- $100 million of ARR or $100 million over 1 year. We annualize all of this stuff. How much will go -- how much will revenue -- once they're installed and running, there's a delay between when we book something and when we start collecting revenue, because we don't collect revenue until the users are up and running it's implemented, okay, so there's that delay. But once they're up and running, it's an annualized number we're giving you, not a total contract value number we're giving you.\n\n---\n\nNow I get that part, but I also want to make sure I'm clear. This is incremental on top of your current $2 billion plus run rate?\n\n---\n\nOf course. Of course. And it should be a lot more than $2 billion, by the way, because that's next fiscal year. So we're not going to end this fiscal year still at $2 billion. That will grow.\n\n---\n\nYou have bookings that have been booked that have yet to be provisioned. Therefore, you will have a bigger base on which those bookings will go. At the same time, the bookings we get in the future will take time to provision, as they go forward. So it's a layered model, as you'd build up on revenue, Jason. I know you know.\n\n---\n\nI want to ask one thing on the database business. Larry, a lot of customers in the past have been conditioned to wait for R2 as a database to come out. This time around, you guys made a major release this past summer with the in-memory option. I'd be curious to get your take on, how -- what are you seeing in terms of customer adoption? Are we starting to see folks say, \"Hey we're going to move to this incremental dot release that came out. I think it was June, July time frame.\" Or are some folks still waiting for R2? And what's the advice or the guidance from Oracle in terms of when customers should migrate to 12C?\n\n---\n\nOkay. So there are 2 major pieces of our new database release. One, as you mentioned, is the in-memory option, but that's not the only driving factor of people upgrading their database version. The other is multi-tenancy, the multi-tenant option, which is appropriate for the cloud. It allows them to, again, convert all of their existing Oracle applications and make them multi-tenant applications, while preserving security and reliability. A better way than do multi-tenancy at the application layer. Anyway, we think those 2 features in concert are driving -- will drive a much more rapid adoption of the Oracle Database over the next couple of years. So we think our database business is going to have a very strong 24 months coming up.\n\n---\n\nAnd Jason, the options did very, very well in the quarter. So there's no question customers are extremely interested and are buying the option.\n\n---\n\nCan you talk about the net new cloud bookings? And what exactly is driving that if you can give us color by product? Is it HCM or CRM? Or to Larry's point, the layer. Is it the PaaS or the SaaS layer? Or geographies? And particularly, Larry, if could drill in to the past layer? Help us understand, is it a net new market? Or could it come at the expense of the traditional database business, which maybe gets cannibalized or maybe not? Just wanted to get your thoughts on it.\n\n---\n\nLet me -- Mark will probably give you a more detailed answer, but my answer is yes. It's all of the above. One of the things -- we have such a broad -- if you look at our product line versus our competitors, we're Salesforce's only real competitor in sales automation. We're the leader in marketing automation. We're fighting hard to be the leader in service automation where our competitor is Salesforce.com. We're Workday's only real competitor in HCM, and we think we've passed them in HCM, but you can make an argument, we're both fighting hard in HCM. But we're killing Workday in ERP. If you conclude ERP and EPM together, it's planning, budgeting, performance management and the classic ERP, all of that. We sold 2.5x more customers this past quarter than they've done in the life of their company. We are the clear leader in high-end -- in mid-range and high-end ERP, with no competition from Workday. They're just not there. Or when they're there, they're losing, every time. So we're very strong in HCM. We're very strong in ERP. We're very strong -- we're the leader in ERP, we're the leader in marketing, we're the leader in EPM. We're contending for leadership in service automation and in HCM. And we're the guys from second place behind Salesforce in Salesforce automation. But everyplace else, except for that one segment, that one niche, we're the leader or fighting to be the leader. So we have incredible breadth of SaaS products. Now our SaaS products are built on top of Java and the Oracle Database, the platform. And companies want to make extensions to the applications. They want to link the applications to their existing applications and so on. Using our platform makes a lot more sense than using a proprietary platform from Salesforce.com. We don't think it's a fair fight. By the way, Salesforce.com uses our platform to build their applications. They just can't sell our platform as a part of their service offering to their customers, because they have no license to do so. We can sell our platform. We do sell our platform. So we sell the same platform that we build on to our customers. So we've seen a huge amount of interest, both from our SaaS customers using our platform, and also that enormous -- this huge install base. We have, in the database business, Intuit is moving test and development and certain aspects of their database work to the cloud. Not everything, but a part of it. A bit of a hybrid, and we're seeing these customers now experimenting. They're at the experiment level. But the potential for this, as Mark said, is probably bigger than our SaaS business. And I think we're going to be, by far, the leading SaaS company in the cloud. Look at our product portfolio. Kash, who wins in all of these battles? The suite vendors, always beat the point solution guys. It's happened in every generation of computing, where the end user, the customer, doesn't want to be the integrator of 30 separate applications from 30 separate vendors. No different now. Just all in the cloud now. Same problem. They don't want to integrate a lot of different stuff. We have all the stuff pre-integrated. We think we're in a great position. We're seeing hyper growth at SaaS. We're seeing hyper growth in PaaS. We're getting bigger and our growth rates are getting higher. That's the -- unlike anyone else in the cloud business.\n\n---\n\nKash, [indiscernible] and listen, add to it the products are more mature. We're on release 9 of our SaaS products, right? We only have -- not only are our products more mature, we have more of them. Our suite is broader. We added -- we've added sales capacity before. We added them 2.5 years ago. So realigning the sales force, adding capacity, they're trained. They're getting more training, and we have references. And when you add the familiarity now of the SI community to it, you just have a lot of factors. There's no one of these factors in isolation. It's the culmination of a lot of work over a lot of period of time.\n\n---\n\nMark, I was wondering if you could share with us -- I mean, your performance this quarter, given what's going on with currency, was definitely better than, I think, people were expecting on a constant currency basis even in -- I'm just wondering, how much of that do you think maybe the U.S. environment -- deal-closing environment getting a little bit better from a macro perspective? And how much of it is due to Salesforce efficiency improvement?\n\n---\n\nSo you're saying macro versus us?\n\n---\n\nNo, macro in the U.S., right, seems to be doing better. So how much of it is due to kind of -- is your sales force productivity improving? And that's what's driving kind of the confidence in the guidance for next quarter, and your results on a constant currency basis this quarter? Because I think versus what everyone was thinking, things look a little bit -- things are looking better?\n\n---\n\nWell, I don't think anything changed from what we have been seeing for a while. The only difference is we saw it in pipeline. We saw it in proposal and now it's turned into actual numbers and performance. So I don't think this is an event. I think this is a set of activities that have occurred over a long period of time, as I tried to reference in my previous question. I would not take some short-term improvement in the U.S. macro and turn that into -- that's why Oracle had great cloud bookings in Q2. I think our performance was driven by exactly the phenomena that I described. Better -- great products, more mature products, better references, lots of capacity in our sales force. It's better trained. It's out in the market and winning deals. That's what I think drove it.\n\n---\n\nI'd like to second what Mark said, is we're just further up the learning curve at everything. Our sales management team is terrific. We realigned our sales force against our secular competitor, so we have an HCM sales force that goes up against Workday. We have a sales automation sales force that goes up against Salesforce.com, and we have a service automation sales force that goes up at -- but they're different. It goes up against Salesforce.com. We have a marketing automation sales force. We have an ERP sales force. We have an EPM sales force. We have all of these specialized sales force -- forces, and we created a -- actually Mark created those several years ago, and we've been hiring, staffing and they're much more mature. We started working on some of these products. A lot of these products are -- we built them internally. We started -- now 10 years ago, after 10 years of development, the Fusion Applications, again, as Mark said, we're in release 9, and they're getting really good. The user interface is getting good. We have a lot of good customer feedback, again, over a period of years. We have improved the UIs. They've improved that multinational capability. They're -- we have improved security in the cloud. We're the leader -- I think we're the leader in application security in the cloud. So it's just walking up the learning curve. And at some point, it becomes visible to everybody. Now I think we've been -- Mark -- a couple -- a few quarters ago talked about the size of the pipeline. They look pretty -- they are kind of stunning. But I know the next thing, is it turns into bookings, next thing it turns into revenue. The next thing is we have more revenue than anyone else in the cloud. And I think that's the next shoe that's going to drop.\n\n---\n\nI have a question for Safra. Safra, as you said CapEx, has creeped up a little bit. It's up 26% on a trailing 12-month basis or about $150 million. Non-GAAP operating margins have really held steady, as has free cash flow. But as you transition to more cloud-based business, should we expect free cash flow to trail off a bit, even if it's just temporarily?\n\n---\n\nIt's all so tiny. These amounts are so small in the scheme of what's going on. I mean, I think it's kind of unusual that I would even call out a $150 million increase year-over-year on -- of capital expenditure. But since you guys aren't even used to it, I figured, all right, let me call it out, as small as it is. Obviously, in the launch of PaaS -- for PaaS, and the volumes that we are expecting, we made our investment. And as we expand, we'll continue, but these are really tiny numbers and are totally dwarfed by our $14-plus billion in free cash flow. I mean, it's kind of -- I'm not sure other companies would have even mentioned it. And you're probably asking me because other companies make these enormous announcements of spending billions and billions. And you have to remember, I mentioned it at Financial Analyst Day, we control almost our entire supply chain. See, we literally -- I mean, we're very close to starting with SAN, and then we have computers. I mean -- so I mean, we make almost everything. And as a result, we get everything at the best possible prices and economies of scale. We're already a very large company. So we already had huge investments over the years and so we have a lot of capacity. And again -- so I would not fret on this really small number, because I'm not planning on making some announcements that we're going to spend billions because we've already spent. And it's just showing up little tiny bitties at a time.\n\n---\n\nOkay. That's helpful. If I could, just a quick, sort of tactical follow-up, and it's regards to guidance. I mean, we can go through our own calc for foreign exchange effects to get a reported number relative to the constant currency guidance. But generally, what's the delta in growth between -- for the top line, between constant currency and reported numbers that you have?\n\n---\n\nIn the -- in this past quarter that we just had?\n\n---\n\nI think you're saying guidance.\n\n---\n\nOh, in guidance?\n\n---\n\nNo actually, I'm talking about guidance, yes.\n\n---\n\nWell, I didn't give a -- listen, the range right now compared to last year, depending on which line item, because it depends for us, geographic distribution and all of those things, it's over 4%. In some areas, it approaches 5%. I mean, it's -- the -- a number of currencies really collapsed in comparison to the dollar. So if that's what you're asking me, I think I'm answering, if things stayed as they are today, it is over 4% of impact in many of the big -- of the numbers you guys follow.\n\n---\n\nSafra, just on operating margins. There's been a lot of focus, if you can continue to drive steady operating margin improvement despite this transition in the cloud. I think you were clear to John that there -- the investments are already in. But as you look at kind of the next level of operational improvement, where do you see the biggest levers? And I guess, as you transition in the cloud, as more of the business gets there. Is this inherently a more profitable business from your perspective, as you get to that side?\n\n---\n\nOh, yes. Oh, yes. I mean, there's no question. We've done the analysis and I think I shared at least some of it with you all during Financial Analyst Day, but there is no question that at scale, we continue to improve our margins dramatically, taking advantage of both our economies of scale and our control of almost our entire supply chain and really our intense automation, which really ultimately results in our being very, very price competitive and allowing our customers to spend much, much less all in than they ever did, and yet we get a much more significant percentage of their wallet share. So we expect, as we continue to go, I'm very pleased with where margins laid out this quarter. And as we get to volume, I actually think we will do better -- continue to do better.\n\n---\n\nMost people have touched on a lot of the other lines of businesses so far, but I wanted to ask a question about hardware. You guys exceeded your guidance this quarter and guiding for growth year-over-year again next quarter. Just give us a sense for what you're seeing in that hardware line and we've finally hit that point that you all talked about, that the stuff you're not focused on is getting small enough and declining less that the growth areas are starting to show -- just show through or just how we should think of that would be great?\n\n---\n\nWell, I think you should think about that we're just winning. I mean, that will be the overriding thing I would take away for you. If you look at some of the markets we're in, particularly in computers that are -- scaled computers, the $20,000, $25,000 and up category that you typically see for most of the research firms. We're gaining startling amounts of share. When you're talking about growth rate, gains of share that are 7, 8, 9, 10 points of share gain. And if you ask what the drivers are underneath it, what we've been talking about before there, right? We had double-digit bookings growth in Engineered Systems as I described a few minutes earlier. Safra and I both mentioned a couple of products us, and we've had very good performance out of what's called the Oracle SuperCluster, the SPARC SuperCluster has had significant growth. We've had very good growth in a product we don't talk about much called the Oracle Database Appliance. It's had significant growth for us. And so this whole strategy of aligning hardware and software together is what customers want. I can make an argument to you, it's the same market trend you see on the cloud. We just do more work for the customer. We integrate the products for the customer. The customer doesn't have to do it. We optimize the software for the solution. That's delivered us strong growth. And so when you look across, really, every line for us, we had very good performance. By the way, I should add storage. Storage, our network attach product began off now what's a bigger base, had very strong growth in the quarter as well. So we're quite pleased with the performance we have seen in most of our product categories across most of our geographies, particularly in terms of share gains.\n\n---\n\nI've got a question about 2 growth metrics that stood out to me that exceeded my expectations, and I'd love some color. The first and maybe this is directed to Mark. Mark, it felt like North American database in the prior few quarters ran a little bit less than expectations, and yet Safra mentioned in her comments that North American database sales were back to double digits. And I'd love to understand what drove that. It doesn't feel like there's a big broader demand improvement. So I'd love to know how you pulled that off. It's impressive. And then for Safra, you put up 9% software support revenue growth in constant currency. That's actually the best number you've put up in a little while, and I'd love a little color on that.\n\n---\n\nWell, I think on the database question in North America, Larry answered that a bit earlier, talking about 12C. I mean, we're into a new release. We've talked about the time frames it would come on board. You saw a good performance in North America. Frankly, when you looked at database overall in CD, we grew, I think 5, 6 points, I want to say it's 6 in CD, and so again, my guess would be we're gaining share again, as you look at database overall. It's -- I know you mentioned the metric you described about database, but as I tried to go through it in the Financial Analyst Meeting, when you look at the CAGR on a 3-year basis, it is a very strong upper single-digit CAGR in database. So while you talk about one quarter or another, this is not a new phenomena that you see this kind of performance in database and now with 12C, our pipeline has grown in database and I think it's reflected in the numbers that you saw in the quarter.\n\n---\n\nSure. I'm actually looking at all the numbers and the contract base, and it's been going up. It -- I mean, it jumps around, but I have other quarters where it's very close. Remember, we're selling an extremely large amount. Cancellation rates are very low. Very low -- attach rates are extremely high, and all of that added together just ends up with a good number.\n\n---\n\nThank you, operator. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours. Dial-in information can be found in the press release issued earlier today. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. We look forward to speaking to you again. Thank you for joining us today. With that, we'll close the call.",

So our big push is in the PaaS. We are in Infrastructure as a Service, which is a low-cost commodity business, where we have the same pricing as Amazon and Google and the rest. We're in that because when our customers come -- as far as Mark said earlier, they're buying one pillar, they'll buy another. I can talk about layers in the cloud where they'll buy a few SaaS applications, they'll buy some PaaS, and they'll buy some Infrastructure as a Service, is they want to have a unified security model and a fast network to interconnect all of these pieces.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jason Maynard (Analysts)】\nI have 2 questions. One, I want to follow up on the cloud piece, and then a question on the database. On the cloud piece, Larry, you talked about $1 billion in bookings. I just want to make sure that I'm reading this correctly. That's an incremental $1 billion on top of your current...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Ellison (Executives)】\nYes, that's all new business -- that's another bit that we will have sold and when you annualize -- this is not total contract value. This is in terms of annual subscription rates that we will sell next fiscal year, well -- in excess. We expect to sell well in excess of $1 billion of new annual subscription.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jason Maynard (Analysts)】\nAnd that's on top of your current...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Ellison (Executives)】\nWhich is about what Salesforce will be selling in their next fiscal year. I think, they're at $1.1 something like that as best as we can estimate, and we think we have a good chance of passing them. I don't know if we can pass them, or catch them or -- but it's getting very close. We're in that ballpark. So we're selling new business at the same rate as the market leader next year, which I think -- again, we're experiencing hyper growth. Salesforce is slowing down. We're speeding up. They're only twice as big as us. They're -- round numbers, they're $4 billion, we're $2 billion. But we're growing a lot faster, and we have a lot more products. And we have a large install base to sell into. So we think -- again, I said, I know, just words. We said we think we can become #1 in the cloud. We think we will be #1 in the cloud, and we will be #1 in the cloud very quickly.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Hurd (Executives)】\nAnd Jason, just to add to your question. I mean most of all of our comments that Larry made, that I made, we're all talking about ARR, but not TCV. So there's not a multiplier on that. Our average contract value is actually longer than annual. But we're talking in comparisons of ARR.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Ellison (Executives)】\nYes. IBM will announce a $1 billion deal over 10 years. That $1 billion deal with us would be $100 million, if it's a 10-year deal and it's evenly distributed, we would count that as $1 billion -- $100 million of ARR or $100 million over 1 year. We annualize all of this stuff. How much will go -- how much will revenue -- once they're installed and running, there's a delay between when we book something and when we start collecting revenue, because we don't collect revenue until the users are up and running it's implemented, okay, so there's that delay. But once they're up and running, it's an annualized number we're giving you, not a total contract value number we're giving you.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jason Maynard (Analysts)】\nNow I get that part, but I also want to make sure I'm clear. This is incremental on top of your current $2 billion plus run rate?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Ellison (Executives)】\nOf course. Of course. And it should be a lot more than $2 billion, by the way, because that's next fiscal year. So we're not going to end this fiscal year still at $2 billion. That will grow.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Hurd (Executives)】\nYou have bookings that have been booked that have yet to be provisioned. Therefore, you will have a bigger base on which those bookings will go. At the same time, the bookings we get in the future will take time to provision, as they go forward. So it's a layered model, as you'd build up on revenue, Jason. I know you know.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jason Maynard (Analysts)】\nI want to ask one thing on the database business. Larry, a lot of customers in the past have been conditioned to wait for R2 as a database to come out. This time around, you guys made a major release this past summer with the in-memory option. I'd be curious to get your take on, how -- what are you seeing in terms of customer adoption? Are we starting to see folks say, \"Hey we're going to move to this incremental dot release that came out. I think it was June, July time frame.\" Or are some folks still waiting for R2? And what's the advice or the guidance from Oracle in terms of when customers should migrate to 12C?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Ellison (Executives)】\nOkay. So there are 2 major pieces of our new database release. One, as you mentioned, is the in-memory option, but that's not the only driving factor of people upgrading their database version. The other is multi-tenancy, the multi-tenant option, which is appropriate for the cloud. It allows them to, again, convert all of their existing Oracle applications and make them multi-tenant applications, while preserving security and reliability. A better way than do multi-tenancy at the application layer. Anyway, we think those 2 features in concert are driving -- will drive a much more rapid adoption of the Oracle Database over the next couple of years. So we think our database business is going to have a very strong 24 months coming up.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Safra Catz (Executives)】\nAnd Jason, the options did very, very well in the quarter. So there's no question customers are extremely interested and are buying the option.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kash Rangan (Analysts)】\nCan you talk about the net new cloud bookings? And what exactly is driving that if you can give us color by product? Is it HCM or CRM? Or to Larry's point, the layer. Is it the PaaS or the SaaS layer? Or geographies? And particularly, Larry, if could drill in to the past layer? Help us understand, is it a net new market? Or could it come at the expense of the traditional database business, which maybe gets cannibalized or maybe not? Just wanted to get your thoughts on it.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Ellison (Executives)】\nLet me -- Mark will probably give you a more detailed answer, but my answer is yes. It's all of the above. One of the things -- we have such a broad -- if you look at our product line versus our competitors, we're Salesforce's only real competitor in sales automation. We're the leader in marketing automation. We're fighting hard to be the leader in service automation where our competitor is Salesforce.com. We're Workday's only real competitor in HCM, and we think we've passed them in HCM, but you can make an argument, we're both fighting hard in HCM. But we're killing Workday in ERP. If you conclude ERP and EPM together, it's planning, budgeting, performance management and the classic ERP, all of that. We sold 2.5x more customers this past quarter than they've done in the life of their company. We are the clear leader in high-end -- in mid-range and high-end ERP, with no competition from Workday. They're just not there. Or when they're there, they're losing, every time. So we're very strong in HCM. We're very strong in ERP. We're very strong -- we're the leader in ERP, we're the leader in marketing, we're the leader in EPM. We're contending for leadership in service automation and in HCM. And we're the guys from second place behind Salesforce in Salesforce automation. But everyplace else, except for that one segment, that one niche, we're the leader or fighting to be the leader. So we have incredible breadth of SaaS products. Now our SaaS products are built on top of Java and the Oracle Database, the platform. And companies want to make extensions to the applications. They want to link the applications to their existing applications and so on. Using our platform makes a lot more sense than using a proprietary platform from Salesforce.com. We don't think it's a fair fight. By the way, Salesforce.com uses our platform to build their applications. They just can't sell our platform as a part of their service offering to their customers, because they have no license to do so. We can sell our platform. We do sell our platform. So we sell the same platform that we build on to our customers. So we've seen a huge amount of interest, both from our SaaS customers using our platform, and also that enormous -- this huge install base. We have, in the database business, Intuit is moving test and development and certain aspects of their database work to the cloud. Not everything, but a part of it. A bit of a hybrid, and we're seeing these customers now experimenting. They're at the experiment level. But the potential for this, as Mark said, is probably bigger than our SaaS business. And I think we're going to be, by far, the leading SaaS company in the cloud. Look at our product portfolio. Kash, who wins in all of these battles? The suite vendors, always beat the point solution guys. It's happened in every generation of computing, where the end user, the customer, doesn't want to be the integrator of 30 separate applications from 30 separate vendors. No different now. Just all in the cloud now. Same problem. They don't want to integrate a lot of different stuff. We have all the stuff pre-integrated. We think we're in a great position. We're seeing hyper growth at SaaS. We're seeing hyper growth in PaaS. We're getting bigger and our growth rates are getting higher. That's the -- unlike anyone else in the cloud business.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Hurd (Executives)】\nKash, [indiscernible] and listen, add to it the products are more mature. We're on release 9 of our SaaS products, right? We only have -- not only are our products more mature, we have more of them. Our suite is broader. We added -- we've added sales capacity before. We added them 2.5 years ago. So realigning the sales force, adding capacity, they're trained. They're getting more training, and we have references. And when you add the familiarity now of the SI community to it, you just have a lot of factors. There's no one of these factors in isolation. It's the culmination of a lot of work over a lot of period of time.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Heather Bellini (Analysts)】\nMark, I was wondering if you could share with us -- I mean, your performance this quarter, given what's going on with currency, was definitely better than, I think, people were expecting on a constant currency basis even in -- I'm just wondering, how much of that do you think maybe the U.S. environment -- deal-closing environment getting a little bit better from a macro perspective? And how much of it is due to Salesforce efficiency improvement?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Hurd (Executives)】\nSo you're saying macro versus us?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Heather Bellini (Analysts)】\nNo, macro in the U.S., right, seems to be doing better. So how much of it is due to kind of -- is your sales force productivity improving? And that's what's driving kind of the confidence in the guidance for next quarter, and your results on a constant currency basis this quarter? Because I think versus what everyone was thinking, things look a little bit -- things are looking better?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Hurd (Executives)】\nWell, I don't think anything changed from what we have been seeing for a while. The only difference is we saw it in pipeline. We saw it in proposal and now it's turned into actual numbers and performance. So I don't think this is an event. I think this is a set of activities that have occurred over a long period of time, as I tried to reference in my previous question. I would not take some short-term improvement in the U.S. macro and turn that into -- that's why Oracle had great cloud bookings in Q2. I think our performance was driven by exactly the phenomena that I described. Better -- great products, more mature products, better references, lots of capacity in our sales force. It's better trained. It's out in the market and winning deals. That's what I think drove it.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Ellison (Executives)】\nI'd like to second what Mark said, is we're just further up the learning curve at everything. Our sales management team is terrific. We realigned our sales force against our secular competitor, so we have an HCM sales force that goes up against Workday. We have a sales automation sales force that goes up against Salesforce.com, and we have a service automation sales force that goes up at -- but they're different. It goes up against Salesforce.com. We have a marketing automation sales force. We have an ERP sales force. We have an EPM sales force. We have all of these specialized sales force -- forces, and we created a -- actually Mark created those several years ago, and we've been hiring, staffing and they're much more mature. We started working on some of these products. A lot of these products are -- we built them internally. We started -- now 10 years ago, after 10 years of development, the Fusion Applications, again, as Mark said, we're in release 9, and they're getting really good. The user interface is getting good. We have a lot of good customer feedback, again, over a period of years. We have improved the UIs. They've improved that multinational capability. They're -- we have improved security in the cloud. We're the leader -- I think we're the leader in application security in the cloud. So it's just walking up the learning curve. And at some point, it becomes visible to everybody. Now I think we've been -- Mark -- a couple -- a few quarters ago talked about the size of the pipeline. They look pretty -- they are kind of stunning. But I know the next thing, is it turns into bookings, next thing it turns into revenue. The next thing is we have more revenue than anyone else in the cloud. And I think that's the next shoe that's going to drop.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John DiFucci (Analysts)】\nI have a question for Safra. Safra, as you said CapEx, has creeped up a little bit. It's up 26% on a trailing 12-month basis or about $150 million. Non-GAAP operating margins have really held steady, as has free cash flow. But as you transition to more cloud-based business, should we expect free cash flow to trail off a bit, even if it's just temporarily?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Safra Catz (Executives)】\nIt's all so tiny. These amounts are so small in the scheme of what's going on. I mean, I think it's kind of unusual that I would even call out a $150 million increase year-over-year on -- of capital expenditure. But since you guys aren't even used to it, I figured, all right, let me call it out, as small as it is. Obviously, in the launch of PaaS -- for PaaS, and the volumes that we are expecting, we made our investment. And as we expand, we'll continue, but these are really tiny numbers and are totally dwarfed by our $14-plus billion in free cash flow. I mean, it's kind of -- I'm not sure other companies would have even mentioned it. And you're probably asking me because other companies make these enormous announcements of spending billions and billions. And you have to remember, I mentioned it at Financial Analyst Day, we control almost our entire supply chain. See, we literally -- I mean, we're very close to starting with SAN, and then we have computers. I mean -- so I mean, we make almost everything. And as a result, we get everything at the best possible prices and economies of scale. We're already a very large company. So we already had huge investments over the years and so we have a lot of capacity. And again -- so I would not fret on this really small number, because I'm not planning on making some announcements that we're going to spend billions because we've already spent. And it's just showing up little tiny bitties at a time.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John DiFucci (Analysts)】\nOkay. That's helpful. If I could, just a quick, sort of tactical follow-up, and it's regards to guidance. I mean, we can go through our own calc for foreign exchange effects to get a reported number relative to the constant currency guidance. But generally, what's the delta in growth between -- for the top line, between constant currency and reported numbers that you have?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Safra Catz (Executives)】\nIn the -- in this past quarter that we just had?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nI think you're saying guidance.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Safra Catz (Executives)】\nOh, in guidance?\n\n---\n\n【質問: John DiFucci (Analysts)】\nNo actually, I'm talking about guidance, yes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Safra Catz (Executives)】\nWell, I didn't give a -- listen, the range right now compared to last year, depending on which line item, because it depends for us, geographic distribution and all of those things, it's over 4%. In some areas, it approaches 5%. I mean, it's -- the -- a number of currencies really collapsed in comparison to the dollar. So if that's what you're asking me, I think I'm answering, if things stayed as they are today, it is over 4% of impact in many of the big -- of the numbers you guys follow.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Brent Thill (Analysts)】\nSafra, just on operating margins. There's been a lot of focus, if you can continue to drive steady operating margin improvement despite this transition in the cloud. I think you were clear to John that there -- the investments are already in. But as you look at kind of the next level of operational improvement, where do you see the biggest levers? And I guess, as you transition in the cloud, as more of the business gets there. Is this inherently a more profitable business from your perspective, as you get to that side?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Safra Catz (Executives)】\nOh, yes. Oh, yes. I mean, there's no question. We've done the analysis and I think I shared at least some of it with you all during Financial Analyst Day, but there is no question that at scale, we continue to improve our margins dramatically, taking advantage of both our economies of scale and our control of almost our entire supply chain and really our intense automation, which really ultimately results in our being very, very price competitive and allowing our customers to spend much, much less all in than they ever did, and yet we get a much more significant percentage of their wallet share. So we expect, as we continue to go, I'm very pleased with where margins laid out this quarter. And as we get to volume, I actually think we will do better -- continue to do better.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Philip Winslow (Analysts)】\nMost people have touched on a lot of the other lines of businesses so far, but I wanted to ask a question about hardware. You guys exceeded your guidance this quarter and guiding for growth year-over-year again next quarter. Just give us a sense for what you're seeing in that hardware line and we've finally hit that point that you all talked about, that the stuff you're not focused on is getting small enough and declining less that the growth areas are starting to show -- just show through or just how we should think of that would be great?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Hurd (Executives)】\nWell, I think you should think about that we're just winning. I mean, that will be the overriding thing I would take away for you. If you look at some of the markets we're in, particularly in computers that are -- scaled computers, the $20,000, $25,000 and up category that you typically see for most of the research firms. We're gaining startling amounts of share. When you're talking about growth rate, gains of share that are 7, 8, 9, 10 points of share gain. And if you ask what the drivers are underneath it, what we've been talking about before there, right? We had double-digit bookings growth in Engineered Systems as I described a few minutes earlier. Safra and I both mentioned a couple of products us, and we've had very good performance out of what's called the Oracle SuperCluster, the SPARC SuperCluster has had significant growth. We've had very good growth in a product we don't talk about much called the Oracle Database Appliance. It's had significant growth for us. And so this whole strategy of aligning hardware and software together is what customers want. I can make an argument to you, it's the same market trend you see on the cloud. We just do more work for the customer. We integrate the products for the customer. The customer doesn't have to do it. We optimize the software for the solution. That's delivered us strong growth. And so when you look across, really, every line for us, we had very good performance. By the way, I should add storage. Storage, our network attach product began off now what's a bigger base, had very strong growth in the quarter as well. So we're quite pleased with the performance we have seen in most of our product categories across most of our geographies, particularly in terms of share gains.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Karl Keirstead (Analysts)】\nI've got a question about 2 growth metrics that stood out to me that exceeded my expectations, and I'd love some color. The first and maybe this is directed to Mark. Mark, it felt like North American database in the prior few quarters ran a little bit less than expectations, and yet Safra mentioned in her comments that North American database sales were back to double digits. And I'd love to understand what drove that. It doesn't feel like there's a big broader demand improvement. So I'd love to know how you pulled that off. It's impressive. And then for Safra, you put up 9% software support revenue growth in constant currency. That's actually the best number you've put up in a little while, and I'd love a little color on that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Hurd (Executives)】\nWell, I think on the database question in North America, Larry answered that a bit earlier, talking about 12C. I mean, we're into a new release. We've talked about the time frames it would come on board. You saw a good performance in North America. Frankly, when you looked at database overall in CD, we grew, I think 5, 6 points, I want to say it's 6 in CD, and so again, my guess would be we're gaining share again, as you look at database overall. It's -- I know you mentioned the metric you described about database, but as I tried to go through it in the Financial Analyst Meeting, when you look at the CAGR on a 3-year basis, it is a very strong upper single-digit CAGR in database. So while you talk about one quarter or another, this is not a new phenomena that you see this kind of performance in database and now with 12C, our pipeline has grown in database and I think it's reflected in the numbers that you saw in the quarter.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Safra Catz (Executives)】\nSure. I'm actually looking at all the numbers and the contract base, and it's been going up. It -- I mean, it jumps around, but I have other quarters where it's very close. Remember, we're selling an extremely large amount. Cancellation rates are very low. Very low -- attach rates are extremely high, and all of that added together just ends up with a good number.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ken Bond (Executives)】\nThank you, operator. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours. Dial-in information can be found in the press release issued earlier today. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. We look forward to speaking to you again. Thank you for joining us today. With that, we'll close the call.",

      "transcript_text1": "Great. Thank you, and thank you for joining us for a discussion of the Paychex second quarter fiscal 2015 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer.\r\nThis morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the second quarter ended November 30, 2014. We will file our Form 10-Q, which provides additional discussion and analysis of our results for the quarter, within the next few days. Our earnings release and Form 10-Q will be available on our Investor Relations page at paychex.com. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 1 month.\r\nOn today's call, I will review highlights from the second quarter in our operations, sales and product development areas. Efrain will review our second quarter financial results and discuss our full year guidance. And then we'll open it up for your questions.\r\nWe were pleased with the second quarter results. We continue see growth and have good progress on our key initiatives. Payroll revenue continues to advance as a result of increases in revenue per check and client base growth. HRS revenue grew at double-digit rates in the second quarter, led by our success in selling HR outsourcing solutions to our clients. Total service revenue increased 10%. From a sales perspective, we saw continued progress during the second quarter, particularly in our Paychex HR Services and retirement services. We are fully staffed. Rep retention and development is on track, and we have continued to be successful in adding new bank and franchise referral arrangements, as well as increasing our web leads in addition to our CPA referral channel. Our partnership between our selling organizations has never been more efficient as they help our clients realize the full value of the breadth of services that Paychex has to offer, including our newest offering stratustime, the leading cloud-based time-and-attendance solution in the market, from the addition of our nettime solutions company acquired last June. We are also seeing an increase in the sales of our health care reform-related product. We are in a unique position with both payroll data and insurance agency to offer our clients assistance and value in understanding the impact and requirements of the Affordable Care Act and its impact on their business and their employees. We can bring clients great value by helping them navigate the complexities of the act and stay in compliance with their requirements.\r\nFrom a technology perspective, we continue to focus on bringing industry-leading products and enhancements to the market to meet the growing needs of our clients. Our innovative leading-edge technology, coupled with our exceptional client service, we believe, sets us apart in the market.  \r\nDuring the second quarter we introduced Paychex Flex, a product offering which integrates our leading-edge software-as-a-service platform with our newly expanded service offerings. Paychex Flex offers powerful capabilities in a simple user experience that responds to the needs of our clients across the human capital management spectrum. Our new service initiatives offers clients the flexibility of choice for their service needs. This approach gives clients access to a variety of customer service options based on their size and complexity, including our new 24/7 customer service center. Paychex Flex offers a unique blend of both software and service, and we believe, again, it differentiates us, Paychex, in the marketplace. \r\nIn Q2, we also enhanced our mobile app with the introduction of Paychex Time, a mobile time-punch app that offers the quickest mobile punch possible. This app enables client employees to securely record their hours and avoid time-consuming log-ins.\r\nIn summary, we are pleased with our continued execution of our sales and service teams, our product strength and the financial performance. And I appreciate the great work of our Paychex employee team across the country and in Germany and Brazil.  \r\nI will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results in more detail. Efrain?\n\n---\n\nThanks, Marty, and good morning. I'd like to remind everyone that today's conference call -- during today's conference call, we'll make some forward-looking statements that refer to future events and as such, involve some risks. Refer to the press release for a discussion of forward-looking statements and related risk factors.\r\nYou also may recall that during the latter part of last year, we introduced a new health insurance offering within our PEO for PEO clients and worksite employees. Due to the [indiscernible] direct costs as operating expenses rather than a reduction in service revenue, this change had no impact on operating income. This new product offering had an impact on our fiscal 2015 second quarter and 6 months' results as it was not initiated until the second half of fiscal 2014.\r\nAs Marty indicated, our second quarter financial results for fiscal 2015 represented continued progress from the solid start we had for the year. Here are some of the key highlights. I'll provide greater detail in certain areas and wrap with a review of our 2015 outlook. Total service revenue grew 10% for the second quarter to $666 million and 9% to $1.3 billion for the 6 months. Interest on funds held for clients increased 4% for the second quarter and 3% for the 6 months to $10 million and $21 million, respectively. These fluctuations were driven by an increase in average investment balances. Expenses increased 10% for the second quarter and 11% for the 6 months, primarily in compensation-related costs and PEO direct costs. The increase in the portion of PEO direct costs is the result of the new health insurance offering, which accounted for approximately 4% of total expenses for both the quarter and the year-to-date periods. The increase in compensation-related costs was driven by higher employee benefit-related costs, mostly medical costs, along with higher sales, headcount and performance-based comp costs. We also continue our investment in our product development and supporting technology.\r\nOperating income, net of certain items, increased 9% for the second quarter and 7% for the 6 months, $260 million and $517 million, respectively. We maintained strong operating margins and anticipate that our full year will remain within our guidance range, which I'll discuss shortly. Diluted earnings per share increased 9% to $0.47 per share for the second quarter and 7% to $0.94 per share for the 6 months. Net income increased 9% to $173 million for the second quarter and 7% to $344 million for the 6 months.\r\nPayroll revenue -- payroll service revenue increased 4% for both the second quarter and 6 months. We benefited from increases in revenue per check and client base. Revenue per check grew as a result of price increases net of discounting, along with the impact of increased product penetration. We saw a moderation in the growth in checks per payroll in Q2, expect that, that will continue through the year.\r\nHRS revenue grew 21% for the second quarter and 19% for the 6 months. The increase reflects an increase in PEO revenue as a result of the new minimum premium plan that I referred to earlier. This represented approximately 7% of total HRS service revenue for the quarter and 6-month periods. In addition, we experienced strong growth in both clients and worksite employees of Paychex HR. All of the metrics, operational metrics on the HRS side are trending very positively. Retirement services revenue benefited from pricing, together with increase in the number of plans and average asset value of participant funds. Our online HR administration products contributed to the growth through sales success of SaaS solutions.\r\nTurning to our investment portfolio. Our goal is to protect principal and optimize liquidity. We invested in high-quality, lower-risk instruments, primarily variable rate demand notes and bank demand deposits for short-term funds and mutual bonds for the longer term. Our long-term portfolio has an average yield of 1.6% and an average duration of 3.2 years.\r\nOur combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 1.1% for the second quarter and 6 months, consistent with the same periods last year. Average balances for interest on funds held for clients increased during the second quarter and 6 months, primarily driven by wage inflation, together with growth in the client base.\r\nI'll now walk you through highlights of our financial position. It remains strong, with cash and total corporate investments of $928 million as of the end of November and no debt. Funds held for clients as of October -- November 30 were $4.0 billion compared to $4.2 billion as of May 31, 2014. Funds held for clients vary widely on a day-to-day basis and average $3.6 billion for both the quarter and 6 months. This reflects growth of 4% for both periods. Total stockholders' equity was $1.8 billion, reflecting $276 million in dividends paid during the 6 months and 1.3 million shares repurchased. Our return on equity for the past 12 months was 35%.\r\nCash flows from operations were $405 million for the first 6 months, a slight increase from the prior year. This change was the result of higher net income on cash flow from operations offset by fluctuations in working capital. The fluctuations in our operating assets and liability between periods were primarily related to timing of collections from clients, payments for compensation, PEO payroll, income tax and other liabilities. All of these were affected by cutoffs in a given month. It is common for working capital to fluctuate between quarters.\r\nNow let me turn to guidance for the remainder of the year. I'd like to remind you that our outlook is based on current view of economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes and that is our expectation, and our guidance is unchanged for the year. Total service revenue is anticipated to be in the range of 8% to 10%, but the ranges for payroll and HR is consistent with previous guidance.\r\nLet me provide additional color on the second half of the year. We expect that payroll services will be at the very low end of the full year guidance range in the third quarter. But in the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be above the midpoint of the range, and this really just has to do with some timing of revenue shift from third into fourth quarter. It doesn't affect the year as a whole. So let me just repeat that again. We expect payroll services revenue to be at the very low end of the range in the third quarter, but above the midpoint of the range in the fourth quarter for the reasons that I just mentioned. We have also updated the supplemental guidance schedule to reflect HRS revenue expectations in the third and fourth quarters, and you'll see that those ranges have been tightened somewhat. These changes, which are modest changes to update the ranges a little bit more precisely so you can update your models, have no impact whatsoever on full year guidance. Net income growth is anticipated to be in the range of 6% to 8%. Our operating margin and tax rate for the year are expected to be consistent with prior guidance.\r\nNow I'll turn it back to Marty.\n\n---\n\nGreat. Now Derek, we'll open it up for any questions.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nGreat. Thank you, and thank you for joining us for a discussion of the Paychex second quarter fiscal 2015 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer.\r\nThis morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the second quarter ended November 30, 2014. We will file our Form 10-Q, which provides additional discussion and analysis of our results for the quarter, within the next few days. Our earnings release and Form 10-Q will be available on our Investor Relations page at paychex.com. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 1 month.\r\nOn today's call, I will review highlights from the second quarter in our operations, sales and product development areas. Efrain will review our second quarter financial results and discuss our full year guidance. And then we'll open it up for your questions.\r\nWe were pleased with the second quarter results. We continue see growth and have good progress on our key initiatives. Payroll revenue continues to advance as a result of increases in revenue per check and client base growth. HRS revenue grew at double-digit rates in the second quarter, led by our success in selling HR outsourcing solutions to our clients. Total service revenue increased 10%. From a sales perspective, we saw continued progress during the second quarter, particularly in our Paychex HR Services and retirement services. We are fully staffed. Rep retention and development is on track, and we have continued to be successful in adding new bank and franchise referral arrangements, as well as increasing our web leads in addition to our CPA referral channel. Our partnership between our selling organizations has never been more efficient as they help our clients realize the full value of the breadth of services that Paychex has to offer, including our newest offering stratustime, the leading cloud-based time-and-attendance solution in the market, from the addition of our nettime solutions company acquired last June. We are also seeing an increase in the sales of our health care reform-related product. We are in a unique position with both payroll data and insurance agency to offer our clients assistance and value in understanding the impact and requirements of the Affordable Care Act and its impact on their business and their employees. We can bring clients great value by helping them navigate the complexities of the act and stay in compliance with their requirements.\r\nFrom a technology perspective, we continue to focus on bringing industry-leading products and enhancements to the market to meet the growing needs of our clients. Our innovative leading-edge technology, coupled with our exceptional client service, we believe, sets us apart in the market.  \r\nDuring the second quarter we introduced Paychex Flex, a product offering which integrates our leading-edge software-as-a-service platform with our newly expanded service offerings. Paychex Flex offers powerful capabilities in a simple user experience that responds to the needs of our clients across the human capital management spectrum. Our new service initiatives offers clients the flexibility of choice for their service needs. This approach gives clients access to a variety of customer service options based on their size and complexity, including our new 24/7 customer service center. Paychex Flex offers a unique blend of both software and service, and we believe, again, it differentiates us, Paychex, in the marketplace. \r\nIn Q2, we also enhanced our mobile app with the introduction of Paychex Time, a mobile time-punch app that offers the quickest mobile punch possible. This app enables client employees to securely record their hours and avoid time-consuming log-ins.\r\nIn summary, we are pleased with our continued execution of our sales and service teams, our product strength and the financial performance. And I appreciate the great work of our Paychex employee team across the country and in Germany and Brazil.  \r\nI will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results in more detail. Efrain?\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nThanks, Marty, and good morning.

Now Derek, we'll open it up for any questions.",
      "transcript_text3": "Do you have any early read on the calendar year-end selling season and client retention?\n\n---\n\nYes, client retention continues to be very strong, so we feel very good, very consistent with that. And the early look, obviously, you don't know until, obviously, we're through January, but it looks good to us. And selling continues to progress well. It is early, particularly in the small market side, to know for sure, but we're -- I think we're off to a good start through November and December. From what we're seeing, we've got full rep headcount. We've got turnover pretty consistent to where we want it to be, and we're feeling, at this point, pretty good about it.\n\n---\n\nWhat is client retention running currently?\n\n---\n\nI'd say we're very consistent, still around 82%, which is basically our all-time best.\n\n---\n\nGot it. And can you quantify for us bookings growth in the November quarter?\n\n---\n\nNo, we don't really -- we don't give that out, and we certainly would wait until we get through the selling season before we talk about kind of how it was. We feel pretty good about it though. We mentioned in the first quarter that we felt good about Q1. Q2 was very consistent from a revenue par growth, annualized revenue sold.\n\n---\n\nCan you quantify growth in checks per client?\n\n---\n\nYes, checks per client were under 1% in the quarter. I had mentioned in previous calls that once we started dipping under 1%, we wouldn't call out the exact tenth of a point. We saw some moderation in checks per client. We're looking at it. It seems to be consistent with what we're seeing in the -- what seems to be happening in the under-50 space, which is around 1%, a little bit under in terms of employment growth. But we'll have to see. It can vary sometimes from quarter-to-quarter. This wasn't a particularly strong quarter from a checks per payroll standpoint.\n\n---\n\nUnderstood. And then on pricing, can you quantify what the net price increase is running after discounting?\n\n---\n\nYes, I -- David, I wouldn't go any further than to say we're still in that 2% to 4% range. I feel pretty comfortable it's holding, don't see any significant issues there.\n\n---\n\nUnderstood. Just a quick final question. ADP completes their transition of their small business client base to RUN, they say, by the end of fiscal '15, ending June. What impact will that have, in your view, in terms of direct head-to-head competition versus ADP? And if you could maybe frame that in terms of any new products you have in the small business space.\n\n---\n\nYes, so David, as far as we can understand their strategy, they appear to be obviously moving a lot of people under their RUN platform and also moving a lot of people to an online service model. That has some strengths and some weaknesses associated with it. We think there are challenges in the lower end to operate with that model, and we think we have differentiated service that will compete very well. From a platform perspective, from technology, what they offer versus what we offer in the small market, we feel pretty comfortable we can compete pretty effectively, and we think we've got the better service model.\n\n---\n\nYes, I think, just to add to that, they've been going through this platform change for a while, and I think we've competed very well. In fact, if you kind of look at the gain, the net gain from our numbers, we're gaining slightly from them. We always lose some and take some and I think we're still doing very well, so we don't -- I don't really anticipate much change there. As well as what Efrain said, I think we compete very effectively from the product standpoint. Our SaaS-based products, our online interface and mobility apps, I think, are the best out there right now and we just continue to keep adding to them.\n\n---\n\nI just wanted to start with a follow-up question on the checks per client. I know you said that you expect the slowdown to continue in the second half. What's your sense of kind of where it will actually bottom out? I know it sounds like you're still trying to get to the root cause here, but do you think it could even go negative? And anything you can give us in terms of sort of revenue sensitivity when this metric moves by, I don't know, 50 basis points or 100 basis points.\n\n---\n\nYes, okay. So checks per payroll, when you start getting down below 1%, there's a lot of variability in that number, and it's affected by the mix of what's happening with new clients compared to other clients that are attriting out of the base. I think we're reaching some sort of steady-state here, where that number will oscillate between flat and 1%. That seems to be consistent with what we're seeing in terms of our small business index numbers, and it seems to be implying and -- it's fairly -- you have to be very careful because this is one quarter of data. It seems to be implying that you're reaching some sort of a more moderate state of employment in the small market space. We had 2 or 3 years of really strong checks per payroll and employment growth in the small business space. It seems like that's starting to moderate. The impact on revenue, so what I'd like to say is if you have about 1 point growth in checks, that's typically going to give you anywhere from 25 basis points to 50 basis points, depending on the mix in revenue. So it should be relatively modest, and we should settle in somewhere in that range.\n\n---\n\nAnd that will be specifically for the core payroll?\n\n---\n\nYes, it mostly affects payroll service revenue, yes.\n\n---\n\nBut the 25 to 50 bps is specific to that line, not your total revenue.\n\n---\n\nYes, that's correct. Yes, that's correct. Sorry.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Just wanted to clarify that and then -- no, I had another question, but do you want to finish your answer?\n\n---\n\nOkay, okay, yes.\n\n---\n\nSo just on the CPA referral channel, I know you had mentioned last quarter that you were penetrating some newer CPAs, but I wanted to see if there's any update in terms of latest data on percent of your new sales coming from the CPA network or what percent of them are exclusive to Paychex for payroll referrals. And is there any uptick in competition for this channel?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think it's been pretty consistent competition in the channel. What we were -- what we've done is kind of change the sales force around a bit to have some CPA-centric reps. So where we have a lot of concentration of CPAs in the past, we hadn't done that. We have been pretty clean on the territory of who owned the territory and kind of everything in it. So we've added more dedicated reps just to that CPA channel. It think it's early in that process, but we continue to get a majority of our referrals -- not a majority, a large sense of our referrals from CPAs, and that's been fairly consistent at times. I think it's competitive. I think it's picked up maybe a little bit from a competitive standpoint, meaning from one competitor. There's really not many that go after that channel, it's really 2 of us. And I think there's probably been a little bit more competition from an incentive to the CPA, I guess, I'd say. But we're still -- I still feel good about that and I think we'll have the best sense of that after third quarter.\n\n---\n\nThat's fair. Just last question on the margins, x float income, obviously, running around 39% through the first half of the year. You've got the typical, I guess, seasonal headwinds in the second half. I know you're still endorsing the full year range of 37% to 38%, but should we be thinking about the upper part of that range being more likely? Or does it feel more like kind of right down the middle sort of year?\n\n---\n\nFeels right down the middle sort of year right now, Jason.\n\n---\n\nEfrain, I know you don't want to get too specific as it relates to pricing, but I think on the first quarter call you would mention that pricing trends were kind of trending toward the midpoint of your 2% to 4% range. Would you care to update that at all? Or...\n\n---\n\nI'd care to reiterate what I said.\n\n---\n\nYes, I think what we see, George, is very consistent there. So we're holding -- and we really feel like we're holding the price and the price increase and nothing's really changed in Q2 from Q1.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then I know it's early days here in the selling season, but would you categorize what you're seeing so far as ahead of expectations, in line with your expectations?\n\n---\n\nIt's hard to say. I think I'd say certainly in line, if not a little positive, a little above. But it's early. But we -- you never know, especially in the small business market, because so much of it is done at the last minute and we get a lot of sales in at the last minute. But right now, I'd say certainly at expectations or a little above.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And just last question for me, I just want to make sure I understand it. The deferment of some payroll revenue from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, can you just remind us again what's driving that? And have we seen that before? Or is something going on here that's a little different?\n\n---\n\nWell, yes. So let me explain that in 2 ways. So if you look at last year's results from payroll service revenue, we started the year relatively low, 2.4%, accelerated in Qs 2 and 3 and then ended the year at 3%. That had to do with days. This really didn't have anything to do with days compare. It's simply that cutoffs in a given quarter may affect where revenue falls on the edge of one quarter or another. We looked at -- there's 14 revenue streams that comprise payroll service revenue. As we looked at it, our best estimate is that some revenue that we would otherwise see in Q3 because of timing is going to fall in Q4 this quarter. So these things happen. It doesn't always happen. But if you look at the payroll service revenue line over the last couple of years, you'll see it bouncing up and down, not because it's that variable, but timing can affect it, days can affect it, and that's why I cautioned that you really need to look at the year as a whole.\n\n---\n\nI guess, my first question here is could you give us some sense of what the client growth was like this quarter? I know you talked about the checks per payroll, but I was wondering how has that been trending.\n\n---\n\nYes. So Joe, what we said was we had a goal of growing clients 1% to 3%. We certainly feel pretty comfortable about where we are in that range. And we got off to a good start through the first 6 months. Feel like we're on track in terms of where we expect to be in the year in that range.\n\n---\n\nGot it. And then the year-over-year revenue growth has ticked up over the last couple of quarters. Can you give us a sense of how much of that is associated with this, I guess, either new business or penetrating your own businesses versus the general macro backdrop?\n\n---\n\nWell, I think it's probably a little bit of all. When I'm asked that question, I'd say we could statistically say it's 95% execution. The reality is you need a better environment. So the environment is better. Our execution is better. Pricing is little bit better, and the opportunity in the under-50 space overall is better and we're executing better against it. So I think it's a mix of all of those issues. I would say, though, that our execution on the sales side has been really strong and it's been strong for a number of quarters now, and we feel pretty comfortable about where we are positioned competitively.\n\n---\n\nYes, I agree.\n\n---\n\nAre there any -- I mean, I guess, just 2 parts to the last question. Any metrics that you can provide that you'd like to share with us about the execution on the sales front? And then the second part of that question is more of a competitive one, a lot of general arena or any change in the competitive environment.\n\n---\n\nI'll take the last part and then turn it over to Efrain. I think we've seen the -- certainly, some of the -- more competitors showing up in that mid-market space in particular, and -- but I think we're doing well against them. In fact, we've -- you're -- they're going to pick off some clients at some point because they're new in the market and they've got something to show. What we've done is started to win back some already, which we think is a very positive thing. And overall, it's not having any sizable difference to us. So I think while they're out there, I think we've invested very well in the past, particularly the past 3 or 4 years, and it rolled out a lot of product now that I think has positioned us very well against competitors. So I don't -- while they're out there, we still have the widest breadth of services to offer and certainly the best service and service options, along with the mobility and when you think about all the interconnection. It depends on the client. But when you think about all of the service offerings that we have to connect you in the -- a platform of 401(k), payroll, HR administration, time and attendance, et cetera, it makes us much better from a competitive standpoint. Efrain?\n\n---\n\nI'd say the other thing, Joe, is that we call it out in the press release. While we don't give the specifics, when we get to year end, you can calculate the number. We talk about revenue per check, and revenue per check is just a combination of a number of things. It obviously includes pricing. But I think what you're seeing there is sales to a little bit bigger client on the core payroll side and more sales of precisely the kinds of products that Marty just mentioned to that sales force. Our cross-selling abilities have never been better, and our team selling has never been better. So I think it's all of those working in combination. And while it's easy to look at just what's happening in payroll service revenue and ignore what's happening in HRS, the reality is that they're -- you have to look at both, and our growth rate is a combination of ability to do both of those things well.\n\n---\n\nBoth of you talked about the selling season being good, and I think you've given some thoughts behind why. And I was wondering, if you look at the fundamentals or at least the fundamentals you look at to determine if it will be a good selling season or not, how have those trended? And what are some of those fundamentals that you would look at to kind of predict how the selling season is going to go?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think, one, at this early stage, obviously, you look at submitted. We don't get into that amount of detail, but you look at what kind of sales have been submitted already. And as Efrain mentioned, that's not only payroll, but that's the PEO business, the 401(k) business, et cetera, because you get a sense of those a little bit earlier and even in small business payroll. And things look pretty solid to us. Well, the other thing you look at is what's the -- it's a little more subjective. What's the pulse of the sales folks and the sales leadership, and it's pretty strong right now. As Efrain mentioned, we've got great team selling going on. We've got retention in good place. We've got full reps all out there. All positions are filled. In fact, we're a little slightly over, so all the positions are up and running. Leads are coming in very well. So I think all those early signs, we hate to talk about it until the third quarter is kind of over and you get a sense of it, but it's a pretty good sense right now of what we're seeing, and again, you really got to see January to know, but it's a good sense. And competitively, we feel very good. There's not a lot of things that are popping up competitively that are saying, hey, there is someone out there with a real aggressive pricing like we've had years ago that was really taking some share at a very low price or high, high discounting or something. We're not seeing anything like that. So we feel we're competing very well and the products are going over really well. The retention also looks good at this point. So you don't know again. But again, retention, we're at our best ever and that feels good.\n\n---\n\nAnd Marty, in the press release, you talked about the minimum premium health plan, that doing really well. Is that strictly a reflection of ACA and what your customers are trying to do? Or are there other drivers helping that business grow?\n\n---\n\nI think talking about that plan and specifically to the PEO, when we introduced it in the last half of last year, I think what that really implies is the PEO is doing well. So right now, in the marketplace, PEOs come on very strong and we certainly have felt that kind of from the end of last year through this year. Little slow at the beginning of the year starting, but we seem to be picking up great momentum. I think some of that, Kartik, is definitely health care reform. They're looking for the strength of coming into a co-employment position. But I also think we're having great sales execution on the PEO side. We also -- we expanded it so we're selling -- while you still sell the majority in PEO kind of \"states,\" we're selling it nationwide and we're getting very good sales execution on the PEO side. Something we've been in a long time, but we think the product and the sales team are really kind of hitting at their peak right now.\n\n---\n\nAnd then just one last question. Efrain, on the float portfolio, any thoughts about changing investment strategy or any other aspects of it, considering the rate environment?\n\n---\n\nYes, you know, Kartik, that's a good question. So our duration now is 3.2 and our yield's about 1.6% on the long end of the portfolio. You can see, if you look at that line, that we're ticking up gradually. We obviously invest differently than ADP does. We don't push everything out longer term. Look, we have a conversation about that in the spring. We'll take a look at it. I don't anticipate any major changes. We were very, very positive about rate changes 3 to 4 weeks ago, and now I'm thinking that while we see some rate changes there, they're going to be moderate. And so you're going to have to think about how you position the portfolio in that environment, and we may be there for a longer period of time. So yes, we'll give some thought to that as we get into the back half of the year. I don't anticipate a significant shift, but it looks like we're -- we've got low interest rates here for some more time given the collapse in oil prices.\n\n---\n\nI guess, on the HRS revenue growth, you had -- you'd given, and I guess you've updated this morning, this chart of how adding in the new health plan changes the growth rates. And that chart sort of implies 4% acceleration Q1 to Q2 in HRS revenue. Is that really why we see the acceleration? Or is the underlying momentum in the business adjusting out the impact that the revenue recognition change is having? Has it really picked up momentum?\n\n---\n\nWe saw some improvement in the second quarter. So we had -- versus first quarter, Gary. So we had strong performance literally against every single product line. And insurance, which started a little soft in the first quarter for us, had a good, good quarter. In the second quarter, we expect that to continue. So we anticipate that will continue to have strong performance through the balance of the year.\n\n---\n\nRight. And so the deceleration implied in the back half is more just how it flows through and then starting to lap some of that revenue being in last year, not anything about underlying.\n\n---\n\nYes. No, no, no, sorry, Gary, I probably misunderstood your question. That's correct. So what happens is, in the back half, you anniversary the changes in the minimum premium plan. By the time you get to the third quarter, you're getting about roughly about half of the impact. And by the time you're in fourth quarter, you've anniversary-ed it completely.\n\n---\n\nAnd then on the PEO, and more broadly, HRS strength, I mean, there are several competitors that are public now that we see PEO seems to be doing terrific everywhere. Do you have any -- and obviously, there seems to be some benefit from health reform. But do you have any fears that, that sort of demand is being pulled forward with everyone doing well or it sets up really difficult comparisons once we get into calendar 2015 and more of the mid-market customer, they have to be in compliance, and so then you've sort of done that? Or has this got people really more willing to consider the benefits of this model and you think that the momentum can remain for a while?\n\n---\n\nYes, at some point, the growth itself in PEO will slow down a bit. It's early to talk about where we are in terms of '16. But we've had a strong 1.5 years with respect to PEO. We'll see where we end the year. Marty was mentioning about sales season. Sales season in Q3 is important for the PEO, so where we end up there will give us a good indication of where we are from '16. And I'll let Marty talk specifically about Employee -- Employer Shared Responsibility, which is also an important component of our thought process. But it certainly gets the conversation about PEO's going in a way that probably was different than 2 or 3 years ago.\n\n---\n\nI think also I -- as Efrain said, obviously, when you look year-over-year and when you get into '16, there'll be tougher comparisons on the PEO side. But I think we're very -- still very early stage on health care reform. As Efrain mentioned, our health care reform product is just starting to pick up steam now and we really had it in place before anybody a year ago. But with all the delays in the changes in the regulations, I think it took a while to get going. But we're seeing a nice pickup now from healthcare reform, whether it's PEO or not. And I think this will just add to it. So I think it's still pretty early and I think this will give us some growth for, certainly, for the rest of this year and then into next year.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And then just one last one. On the strong HRS growth, has -- if we look today versus, say, 2 or 3 years ago, has the mix of what's coming up-sell to existing customers who may have already been a payroll client versus new customers that just want these services and you sell them because they're interested in the HRS maybe more than being legacy payroll, has that changed at all? Or is it really the same mix and sales process that you've been executing for [indiscernible]\n\n---\n\nWell, yes, it's similar in ways, although I think a couple of things have picked up. One, Efrain mentioned insurance and health insurance has picked up particularly recently. And so that's an area that started to pick up again. I think 401(k) was very strong a few years ago, and it's kind of leveled out. It's got nice growth. But the fastest-growing is HR outsourcing, whether it be the PEO model or the ASO model or our kind of phone support model. All of those, I think -- the HR support has seen the fastest growth in the last 2 years anyway, and that's picked up a little bit faster in the mix of things. And I think that's just the fact that you've seen HR outsourcing and the complexity of HR come down in the client base. So where it used to be, that was the 50-plus or at least 30- or 40-plus, that's coming down more and more into where we have a lot of clients. And so I think we've gotten very good at selling the value of HR support at various levels to smaller clients. And Efrain mentioned earlier the team selling approach that we've gone through, which is if a client is of a certain size, we go in with multiple sales teams together on the front end instead of coming at them after they have payroll, I think, has also helped get that growth going higher.\n\n---\n\nI guess, can you update us, I guess, at this point in terms of how much is the sales force or your sales resources kind of up year-over-year as we go into the selling season? And is that a fair bogey for how you think about -- I know you said 1% to 3% client growth for this fiscal year but a lot of that was dictated by last selling season. So I'm trying to get a sense for how we should ballpark kind of what the potential is for this upcoming season in terms of client growth.\n\n---\n\nWell, I -- yes, I think from a sales headcount perspective, I'd say it's up around 4%, maybe 4% plus a little bit. So a little stronger. Then we were kind of holding constant for a few years. Last year, we were up a bit, and this year, we went up again across the various sales organizations, around 4%, 4% plus or a little bit over 4%.\n\n---\n\nI didn't catch the second question, back half of the...\n\n---\n\nAnd is it fair to think about the target, and I guess, for client growth, it will be around that number? I know you said 1% to 3% for this fiscal year, but I would assume most of that was driven by last year's kind of selling season.\n\n---\n\nNo, I will just start by saying remember, that sales team is across all divisions. So it's not so much on the payroll growth as we've probably seen more increases in the HRS teams as well. And also, we've moved up some of the virtual sales teams on some of the products like time and attendance and merchant services and so forth as well. So it's a mix across that, Tim. So I wouldn't say that, that necessarily has given you anything on the client growth. The client growth, we still think we're in that 1% to 3%, okay? Efrain, you fair [ph] with that?\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then the new PEO or kind of the new health insurance product, I get a lot of the focus -- I mean, there's an accounting impact of just adding that in there, but how's the client reaction, I guess, been as we look back at this point? It feels like it's been adopted a little more broadly even than you would have thought. And I think the follow-up is, how -- what does that imply? I think you only started doing this in a few markets initially. So do you get more aggressive with rolling this out?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think of it as really 2 different -- I just don't want to mix up 2 different things there. There's the health care plan, where we took on more in the PEO, and that was primarily in Florida and that's the market that we're trying it there. So you're right there, we're doing it in Florida. We're getting good feedback on that. That gives us more flexibility on the rates and the whole process of how we sell and so forth. We've gotten good feedback on that and that's part of our PEO growth, I believe, that you'll see continue. On the health care reform specifically, we've introduced the product across the country. And that's not just PEO, that's to all clients. And it's various products of helping them, but primarily helping them understand and give them reporting on the number of clients that they have as full-time equivalents, whether health care applies to them. If it does apply to them, do they have all the right things in place and how were they going to file the requirements of the health -- of the Affordable Care Act? So I would say both -- they're a little bit different. I don't know if you were combining them or not. But the PEO is going well there in Florida, in particular, where we introduced that plan. And then the health care reform products, as we talk about, is really the reporting and the compliance, and that's across the country. And that's really -- this second quarter just started to really start to pick up some steam. So we're anxious to see how Q3 goes.\n\n---\n\nOkay, right. Yes, I was talking more of the Florida product. I guess, what would you want to see to take that more broadly across the rest of the country?\n\n---\n\nIt's just a matter of can you get the right plans in place and is the risk reasonable for us to take on. This is where we're taking on more of the risks ourselves, and we felt it was certainly a very big PEO market when you think of really 2 or 3 key states for PEO, at least right now, that was a good one to take on. It was worth it because of the size of the market, the number of sales we have there and, of course, the plan we're able to get and work out through the Florida Blue. So we continue to look at those all the time, and we're looking at them around the country as to whether that's the right move or not. It's the combination of all those things.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And if I could slip in one more, there's just this week news of a new legislation around that PEO sector in terms of having some certification and kind of clarifying some of the tax implications of adopting a PEO, I believe. Can you give us your thoughts on, is that meaningful as you think about the growth of that business?\n\n---\n\nSo you're talking about, I think it's called SBEA, another great government acronym. At the margin, it's positive for PEOs. It recognizes them as an important solution within the marketplace. There was some ambiguity about how the government was going to look at PEOs. And we think that it's just going to make the attractiveness of that offering greater in the marketplace. We're digesting all of the provisions of the legislation, and we -- but we think at this point, our compliance group, legal group, think it's going to be a positive for PEO.\n\n---\n\nSo there's been a lot of attention on the growth in the FSA and HSA accounts in the U.S. Can you talk about what role you expect Paychex to play going forward, whether it's continuing to work with partners or becoming more directly involved? And how big an opportunity could this market be?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think FSA has come under some pressure because of some of the changes on it and so forth in legislation and the deductibility of it and everything. I think that's going to slow down a little, but I think HSAs will become stronger. I think that what you'll see there is it gives us more opportunity because I think more health plans, and this could be through the agency as well, through our insurance agency. You'll see more health plans go more toward HSA deductibles and then giving HSA money to employees. I think it's an opportunity for us. I don't know how -- if it's going to be a major impact at this point, but -- and I think you'll see us do a combination of -- probably always partnering to some degree with it because of the backroom requirements of it just make more sense sometimes to partner than to build. But we've been in FSA for a long time, I think we'll be able to handle it very well, and it'll continue to be part of our package.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And then maybe just a follow-up on the partnerships that you have developed with companies like Elavon. Can you talk about how that partnership in payment processing is going and if there's any other type of -- similar types of partnerships in the pipeline?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think the Elavon partnership has gone well. We were a little slow out of the gate on the selling of merchant services. I think we felt that the field sales would be able to sell that well and they were first in for some new businesses, and so they'd be able to sell it. It turns out we learned a lot in different trials on that, that it's a complicated pricing structure based on your type of business and so forth, and very competitive. So what we found was we now have the field sales team refer back into an internal team, which we increased the size this year, and they're doing very well. So we've gotten some real traction this year on the inside team that sells basically virtually. So the field sales refers it back into an inside team, who then talks to the client and sells the credit card, the merchant processing. And that started to pick up some real steam. Now it takes a lot of clients, given the commission structures there, to have substantial revenue given our revenue size. But we do think it's got great momentum, and we're continuing to see that. So it's been a nice partnership, and I think it's starting to take off. Other partnerships like that -- can't think of too many, other than Paychex Accounting Online. We've invested in -- with Kashoo in the Paychex Accounting Online. Again, a little slow getting going. I think we're learning a lot about the marketing of the product and how to integrate it more into the marketing. Our clients still view us very much as the human resource outsource -- human resource -- human capital management, payroll and HR and time and attendance. And getting them to view us as an accounting offering as well with the Kashoo product has been slower than we thought. So we're learning on that, but we're always open to that. And of course, Brazil is a 50-50 partnership with Semco down there to help us get started. And I think just starting in January, we're off to a pretty good start. I wouldn't give a client count at this point, but it's starting to pick up traction as well, and we feel very good about that decision.\n\n---\n\nI have a question about the new platform. I had a chance to take a look at it at the recent HR tech conference and was particularly interested about the Flex enterprise platform for larger clients. I know it's really early, but I'm wondering what the feedback has been from the sales force in early demos and if you think that, that is now fully competitive with some of the more recent entrants, at least, from -- to the public market.\n\n---\n\nYes, I think we do -- obviously, we've been able to show it at some of the shows, and the sales force is really picking up steam on it now, I think. We sold another platform for a long time, so there was a lot of learning there, and we've been enhancing it very quickly. The thing that changes so quickly today is when you release something, almost every month, there's a new release that's adding something to it. And so that's probably been the biggest challenge for the sales force is all the changes to it that we've been adding. That's a good thing because it's added enhancements. Got a good feedback on it. I think the clients really like the way it shows. The user interface is very simple and very direct for them. We're working on integrating more and more of the other products that we have into that. So it's -- there is a full suite of products. And combined with that great user interface and the mobility platform and multiple products that are going anywhere from recruiting, on-boarding, to payroll, to HR administration, time and attendance, all of that's bundled in. And we're giving more service options now between user interface, the mobility and 24/7 client service. I think the differentiator will be technology to some degree, but it will also be the great service that we can provide that I don't think anyone else is focused on. So it's getting good traction with the sales force, and we're anxious to see the January results.\n\n---\n\nGreat. Following up kind of on that theme of being able to do payroll in a lot of different forms. Given all of the updates that you've been making to mobile and your platforms, are you starting to see -- or are you continuing to see a shift towards more online entry as opposed to phone and fax? Is there anything appreciable really happening there? And if there is, do you think that we might see an operating margin benefit over time from that?\n\n---\n\nI think we are seeing some shift toward that, and it's interesting. Particularly, we just saw like a big shift in mobility for like the holiday, for Thanksgiving. So you're seeing it around certain times where -- and which is exactly what we like, where the client has a choice each and every week or every other week, whenever they do payroll. They can go mobility this week. They can go online next week. They always have their dedicated, personalized service to fall back on whenever they need it, and they can just call up and give their payroll over the phone as well. So we're seeing some shift, but the thing that we're seeing that's very positive to us is that clients are using the multitude of options available to them, which is what we wanted to give. We don't want to force them to online. We don't want to force them away from a payroll specialist who gives us the great retention numbers that we have. So I think there certainly has been some opportunities there, and you'll see us -- with our industry-leading margins, you'll see us continue to find ways to keep those. You may find us reinvesting, as we have the last 4 years though, right back into technology because it's going to be this combination of service and technology that makes us successful.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And then just last quick question. Last quarter, you talked about an uptick to -- in sales to new start-ups. You mentioned your continued strength in the under 50, and I'm wondering if that sales to start-ups continued this quarter.\n\n---\n\nYes, it did. We continue to see a positive uptick compared to last year. And so we're still seeing -- the new business start-ups, as you know, I'm sure, still are not back to what they were prerecession levels, but they certainly have ticked up over 700,000. They're just not quite back up, from everything we see, back up over that 800,000 level kind of countrywide. So we're encouraged that we're seeing more sales from new businesses, and that's always been a big part of our business. So yes, that has continued in Q2.\n\n---\n\nMost of my questions have been asked and answered, but I just want to look at the big picture. Maybe Marty, when you look at payroll services growth and HR services growth and you look at the guidance, is that the right model for growth rates? Or are you leaving some growth on the table? Just kind of how do you think about the big picture as we go out for the next couple of years?\n\n---\n\nWell, is it the right model? I think we'll always see the HR service revenue growth growing faster. And I think that we -- what the good thing is there, Bryan, is that we've got a lot of opportunity for -- when you think of the penetration rates that we're at. So even as long as we've been in this business and successful at selling into that base, we still have low penetration rates in a lot of services, right from 401(k) to insurances and so forth. So I think you'll always see that, that growth is higher. I think the interesting thing, approaching $1 billion in revenue in HRS is really exciting to us and going well beyond that. Payroll service revenue growth is always going to be somewhat tied to the economy, but we feel like we're executing well on everything that we can control. And I think you'll see frankly a blending more of that. It won't be so much about how much is payroll service revenue growth and how much is HRS growth but how much is the combined service revenue growth. And we're trying to continue to drive that to upper -- into a consistent upper-single digits kind of place to be. And given that, we then keep those margins up and expanding, and we've got something very unique here. So we're excited about how we're executing and certainly about the opportunity in front of us.\n\n---\n\nWhat's the acquisition pipeline look like? And is there any appetite to take on larger deals moving forward?\n\n---\n\nYes, there is. We've come close on a few. I think that the tricky thing is the valuation. A lot of these things in the pipeline are priced or valued at almost what I would say is a perfect acquisition. So it doesn't leave you a lot of room for error, in our opinion. We've been very successful at the product tuck-ins and the acquisitions like SurePayroll that we've done, and so we're very careful about what we acquire. But the pipeline is pretty good. It's just the valuation has got to be right or we're just -- we're not going to do it. But we've got the cash and the flexibility, and I think we've got a nice track record of executing. So we're pretty aggressive about looking at everything that's out there right now.\n\n---\n\nAnd would everything be in kind of the HR area? Or is there certain other maybe verticals that you guys would look at?\n\n---\n\nI would say, pretty much anything that we're into right now would be in our space. So anything from payroll to PEO and product tuck-ins, but certainly, larger deals as well. And like I said, we've come pretty close, but the valuations are pretty steep. And so again, if we don't feel like we can make that difference, we're going to be pretty disciplined in our pricing.\n\n---\n\nJust a couple of quick follow-ups. On the HRS growth, if I remember right, the 401(k) restatements may have had some impact in the quarter. Could you talk about that? And was it confined to this quarter?\n\n---\n\nJim, it's part of your decision on pricing. HRS was strong for -- in virtually every single line. You make a decision as to whether you want to take that pricing or not. But in the 401(k) business in particular, we had higher assets or moved to bigger plans. And that certainly played some part in it and will continue to play a part for the remainder of the year, but that's not the sole thing driving growth in that business.\n\n---\n\nRight. I was just trying to figure out if that was a little more than normal this quarter.\n\n---\n\nIt was a little bit more than normal this quarter. But again, 401(k), part of the way that we make money in that business is a number of different streams, and all of them were up.\n\n---\n\nGreat, and another follow-up. So just on the new Flex product, could you talk a little bit more about what your primary -- or where you think it'll sell the best? Which size and range of customer?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think we're seeing mostly anywhere from 20 and up. 15 to 20 and up is probably going to be seeing that the most. This is where they -- the good news is I think that's probably even lower than we had expected for a full suite of the products. Now Flex can encompass as little as payroll and as large as the entire suite. And so I think that -- but overall, when you see multiple products being purchased as a bundle, it's in that 20-plus, which is I think a little stronger than we expected. And I think that that's because, again, the market's changing and things are coming down, the need for HR administration, time and attendance, particularly as the technologies made it better. We just introduced Paychex Time, which I mentioned. And here's a mobile punch that now allows you to go in and punch and actually keep the punch, keep your time open on your mobile phone for 70 -- up to 72 hours. So you don't have to log in again, get into your mobile app as an employee and then punch in. You can actually leave it open for multiple time periods. As that stuff gets easier and easier, we're finding smaller businesses are finding big benefits, so we're able to sell them on the big benefits. So we're excited about Flex and the fact that it kind of bundles all this together along with the service options. It's appealing to 20 and above, but certainly, it has some -- it certainly fits even below that.\n\n---\n\nJust a couple of very quick follow-ups. I was just wondering, are you -- I assume you track -- or some kind of tracking of revenue per client. And I'm wondering if you could help us understand how that has been trending, given all the changes in the underlying services and some of the enhancements to the products that you're making to kind of accommodate a bundled type of sale.\n\n---\n\nYes, it's been trending positively, David. I think that what Marty was saying earlier about team selling and cross-selling, I think we've just gotten much better at understanding what a client's needs are based on size, putting the right set of solutions in front of them. And because we have breadth of service -- I'm sorry, breadth of product offering that's pretty unrivaled, we can typically get a client the solution they need from the first instance, which is a little different than what we were doing probably 4 or 5 years ago, where we would wait for payroll and then do the sales sequentially. So look, I'll wait until the end of the year to quantify it, but we're pretty pleased in terms of the revenue uplift that we've been getting per client. So what that implies is that the game no longer is just to simply get units and then add ancillaries, which is what we talked about 5, 6 years ago. It's really get the revenue on the initial sale for the right kind of client, and we're executing pretty well against that strategy.\n\n---\n\nIs there any way that you can disaggregate how much of that phenomenon is contributing to your growth rate? And I guess, on the same line, can you help us understand the margin profile of those clients versus what they look like historically, where you were going in, sell payroll and other services on top of it?\n\n---\n\nYes. So margin profile is not significantly different from what we've seen historically. If you go back 4 or 5 years, our operating income net of float was about 400 basis points lower than it is right now. So we obviously have been able to execute that strategy and grow margins at the same time, that's one. To disaggregate it, I need to give you year-end client data, and then you need to compute what average revenue per client is. So you can get a sense of that if you do that analysis from last year. I won't -- we'll probably update that at the end of the year, but we're getting a pretty nice revenue uplift. And the issue is that we think that, that -- we can continue to execute that strategy into the future.\n\n---\n\nAnd maybe just a related question as it relates to the margin. As you think about these acquisitions that are out there -- and I know valuation's a separate issue. But as you think about that as well as some of the enhancements you're making to the platform and some of these newer segments that you're going after, is the company perhaps thinking more holistically about kind of the margin in terms of that balance between growth and margin? Or has there really been no change internally about that?\n\n---\n\nWell, yes, sure. I mean, I think we're always looking at -- we're trying to get that consistent upper-single-digit growth in the top line and continue to be very shareholder-friendly on the bottom. So we'll have high margins, but it is a balance. If we see a good opportunity to drive growth that might hurt the margin a little bit, then we would -- we're not going to hesitate to do that. It's always going to be a balance though. We want to drive both, but if in the short term it hurts you a little bit, I think we're willing to be able to do that. So we're investing -- I think what we've been very successful at over the last particularly 4 years is driving margin improvement and also investing very heavily in technology, and I see it along the same lines. We drove cost out of operations, we got very productive, tried new things and still got us a great client retention and satisfaction. And we funneled out those dollars into technology, where we were behind 4 or 5 years ago, and put us in a great spot from a technology position, now in a competitive situation. So we see the same thing with an acquisition. Hey, if we're going to take it or -- and it takes on some additional expense, where else are we going to be able to cut to be able to offset it?\n\n---\n\nRight. And just one last thing then. Going to the international expansion, this has been a long road for you guys, starting in Germany years ago and you now have this joint venture in Brazil. I mean, are you getting any more encouraged or less encouraged about the ability for the model to be expanded outside the U.S.? And could you share any insights into kind of where your head's at in terms of kind of taking this into other geographies?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think we'd like to -- as a team, we talked about the strategy a few years ago and decided, hey, look, let's try to pinpoint 3 or 4 countries, tops. Let's get our thing -- let's get it growing. I think there wasn't a focus on it. For quite a while, it was kind of a nice idea but was not always a focus. We started focusing on it. We really doubled the size of Germany through acquisition and through additional salespeople. So we're pretty encouraged there and think that there's still opportunity there, but it has moved slower than we expected. But frankly, their culture is slower to still outsource than we had expected. But -- so we feel pretty good about the fact that I think acquisitions are opening up as well as the opportunities for sales there. In Brazil, having only been there less than a year really, I think we've learned a lot. It's also a little bit slow to come out from the CPA or the client doing it. So we've worked a very good process in with becoming the CPA's backroom. I think that's brought down the revenue per client less than we expected, but it's helped to accelerate the growth in blocks. So you go to a CPA and you take their business, you build credibility with the CPA, then we'll move into the direct sales to the client because we'll have market share and credibility. And that's actually picking up some nice traction. And Semco has helped, I think, knowing Brazil and partnering. That was a different approach than Germany, where we kind of -- it took us a long time because we did it ourselves. And then we're still looking at 1 or 2 countries where we can get in either through acquisition or start-up, primarily probably through acquisition. And we think we're trying to build it to where it's meaningful to our revenue, which is difficult given where we're growing, but I still think it's a nice opportunity.\n\n---\n\nI know it's late. I just wanted to ask one question. Efrain, I think you had mentioned earlier the potential impact of oil prices on your thoughts regarding interest rates. Are there any -- is there any other impact potentially on the rest of the business from the decline in oil prices?\n\n---\n\nNo, I highlighted that because, obviously, it's had an impact on the Fed's thinking around interest rates. I was just reading an article before the call around what they expect to see in terms of consumer uplift. It's hard to peg any of that to have a direct impact on our business. So no, it shouldn't have an impact.\n\n---\n\nYes, we're hoping that it brings up, at least in the short term, some consumer confidence, which may -- gives them some discretionary income to spend and might bring small businesses up. Plus, it's going to help small businesses a bit as it works through, depending on the business. And so hopefully, it has some positive impact, but we haven't seen too much yet.\n\n---\n\nAnd do you have any specific geographic exposure to the states in the U.S. that have a lot of energy production?\n\n---\n\nWe're seeing -- overall, from our small business index, we are seeing that the central part of the U.S. is where we're seeing the best small business job growth because you're seeing increased jobs in the drilling and fracking and so forth. And that's the central, it's anywhere from Texas to North Dakota. So it's interesting that they're having kind of the best job growth rate now, where the coasts have calmed down some. But I wouldn't say it's had any a dramatic effect, but I think that it's been a positive, but mostly in the Central U.S.\n\n---\n\nYes, I was actually looking at it from the opposite perspective with the decline in oil prices, if you've seen a slowdown in job growth there.\n\n---\n\nNo, not that we've seen. No, we have not seen that.\n\n---\n\nFirstly, how should we think about revenue per check? And probably just following on one of the earlier questions, when you think about it, it is dependent on pricing but also the kind of product portfolio you have. What is the price differential between the most basic versions of products which you're selling compared to a full-blown operation? And what kind of penetration levels do you have like if, let's say, put 100 figure to the most basic product to, say, 20% or 30% penetration of the full portfolio? So if you could probably give any numbers around that, that would be helpful.\n\n---\n\nYes, well, S.K., I think the best way -- let me start with the end and then come back to revenue per check. So obviously, we think that revenue per check has been going up and will continue to grow. If you look at each of the product lines we have -- and I say this frequently, Marty does too -- that we have about 10% on average of the base penetrated right now. That's what generating the HRS revenue. So I'll let you figure out in your model what that equates to, but certainly, we think 10% is pretty under-penetrated for the base. And there's probably multiples of that kind of opportunity that exists within the base, ignoring whether you get growth in the base, which we think we'll get over time. With respect to each of the products, it really -- it depends on the product. When you attach an HR outsourcing solution to a payroll client, you're getting multiple Xs of that payroll client's revenue, and that ranges anywhere from 1x to 2x on a 401(k) plan. As I said, multiple Xs of that payroll revenue in an HR outsourcing solution. So it will really vary depending on where the opportunity is and the rate of penetration by product, but we think we still have a long way to go in terms of getting to the point where we've saturated the base with the suite of products that we have.\n\n---\n\nOkay. I just have one other question. For the last few years, you have been excessively investing in products and the point which Marty was mentioning about continuous investments in technology. And this year, you invested quite a lot around sales and marketing. So when do you expect a more normalized investment year? Is it going to be FY '16, FY '17? Yes, any views on that?\n\n---\n\nI think you'll always see some growth in the -- from a sales and marketing perspective, I think, just to keep up with the competitive environment. I think it's fairly normalized. There wasn't a huge increase in sales and marketing. But I think when things are kind of at a normal pace, we're typically trying to grow the sales force by 3% or so. From a technology standpoint, the increase, the level of increase has slowed, and I think it will be why you can always spend millions more on technology. I think we've got a great product portfolio and road map that we invest in and have tried to slow down the increase of spending, but the level of spending will probably stay relatively the same. So I think we're in kind of a normalized -- we're kind of heading into a normalized period right now.\n\n---\n\nA couple of quick questions. Just on the PEO side, when you're getting new clients, are you typically seeing brand-new clients to the overall solution? Or what -- or how many of the new clients that you're getting are competitive takeaways? How would you describe that?\n\n---\n\nI think I would say, it's kind of 50-50. I think we're selling into the base as well as brand-new clients on the PEO concept. So I'd say probably -- and it varies month to month, but probably around 50-50 is fair. I think we're putting a little bit more emphasis on brand-new clients because I think there's a real opportunity out there. I think our sales force is executing well and really can sell the benefits of the PEO to a brand-new client. And it's part of, as Efrain has mentioned a number of times, this kind of team selling. So you don't necessarily have to go in and just sell them payroll or our old model. It's selling them a complete suite if they need it and value it. So you'll see us focus probably some reps just on PEO selling outside the base.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And I mean, obviously, there's a couple of states that are well-penetrated. In terms of the -- outside of those core 2, 3 states that are really well-penetrated, are you seeing an increasing level of acceptance of the PEO concept?\n\n---\n\nYes, and I think this legislation that Efrain mentioned earlier may accelerate that a little bit, too. But I think so, yes, where it's typically Florida, Texas, let's say Georgia. I think even New York now is starting to pick up and some other states that we really haven't seen that much growth before. So I think there is more acceptance, and I think the legislation will make that even better.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And then on the competitive takeaways, on the PEO side, what's the primary reason why somebody would come to you from a competitive perspective?\n\n---\n\nI think the insurance plans that we have, I think, as well as the service and then the technology of the product that you have. And I think when you look at a few of us that are in the PEO business, I mean, there's only a few that really have that wide breadth of it. Also, there is -- you really got to count on somebody large, and I think sometimes people go into the -- there's a lot of small PEOs. I think clients go in there, thinking they're going to get something that in the end they can't provide from a service and technology perspective, and just a safety, I guess, I'd say of the insurance plan. So I think it's a combination of product offering, technology, service and strength of the company behind it.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And so when we -- with the supplemental schedule that you provided, when we take a look at the fourth quarter number for HRS, is -- do we have a full comp in, in terms of the insurance so that the fourth quarter is kind of indicative of the longer-term growth rate to expect out of HRS?\n\n---\n\nOkay. You were good. You had me until the last statement. So I can't give you next year's guidance, but Q4 certainly is indicative of a full compare. I would hesitate, Mark, to say that simply because we're having -- we've been having a very strong year in PEO. When we do our plan, we'll figure that out. I don't anticipate it'll be quite that strong.\n\n---\n\nOkay. So -- but we do have the full compare. It's in terms of the insurance plans, but the factor to think about is that even though Q4 has that full compare, we're then going up against a really strong year. And so therefore, there should be some. So  let's say that we end up being 100, 200 basis points lower than that fourth quarter number, does that seem like a pretty good, long, sustainable...\n\n---\n\nMark, so my answer uniformly is that we target around double digits for HRS, and year-to-year, that can vary a little bit, but that's kind of what we're trying to get to.\n\n---\n\nGot it. And then you said something interesting on the core payroll side, which is that you're already starting to see some clients come back to you from some of the newer solutions. Can you give a little more color around that?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think what we've seen -- it's a small sample set, but what we've seen is the service model being probably the biggest impact. I think what's selling some of the new companies that have come out is user interface and technology might look good to them. The service model has not been as complete or as strong as I think as they expect. I think some clients see service as possibly a commodity as they're going in, and it doesn't turn out to be that way. When you think of the breadth and experience that Paychex has versus some of the start-ups and the rate that they're trying to grow, you're going to have service issues, and I think that's been the primary thing that's driven them back to us.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And then on the new clients that you're getting, are they typically on the smaller end of your range or the higher end of your -- and I'm talking about that under 20 core side.\n\n---\n\nIt'd be over the 20. It'd be more in that mid-market space. Anywhere 20 to 200, really.\n\n---\n\nAll right. I wasn't referring to the ones that are coming back. I just meant in terms of the overall client growth that you mentioned, the 1% to 3%...\n\n---\n\nMark, it's skewing smaller.\n\n---\n\nYes. And what I meant was, is it -- relative to where it's been historically, is it skewing even smaller?\n\n---\n\nI can't really answer that specific question, but it is, in general, smaller.\n\n---\n\nIf I unpack the accounting impact, it looks like your underlying apples-to-apples margins are trending up. Is that accurate? And can you give some color around that?\n\n---\n\nYes, they trended up from Q1, Lisa, and I think I was asked earlier kind of where are we in the guidance range. We still think we're in a -- solidly in the middle. We'll see. We'll update it as we go through quarter-to-quarter.\n\n---\n\nTerrific. And then just a follow-up on the competitive environment in the small business space. You gave a little bit of color earlier around Kashoo and Paychex Accounting Online as well as your sort of net win-backs that you're seeing from some of the new entrants. Can you specifically give some color around Intuit? They have been pretty aggressive in a lot of their earnings calls, talking about their traction in payroll. I'd be curious to see your view on that.\n\n---\n\nYes, we have not really seen losses to Intuit. In fact, we have seen, as we've dug deeper into some of the gains, we've been gaining some from Intuit on a net basis. So I -- we haven't seen a big impact there. I do think they go after a little bit different market. While people always think that they may be taking share from us, we don't see that. We do see they compete more with our SurePayroll brand and company. And SurePayroll is still doing pretty well, so they still have double-digit client growth and so forth. So I think they're still doing well, and we haven't seen a big impact from Intuit. So they may be getting it more from those who are manual and kind of moving to a software, which is what we see happening with SurePayroll.\n\n---\n\nJust -- I'll be quick. I know it's a long call. So just clarifying on the PEO front. I'm curious, have you changed your sales philosophy at all with respect to pushing or promoting PEO? It sounds like you have. I don't think you -- I believe you sell both PEO, ASO together. Has that changed?\n\n---\n\nNo, not really. We do sell them together. I think I did mention, though, that we do think there is a growing opportunity for the PEO. And so we are going to look at -- we are adding some reps that are just PEO-centric, so just kind of dedicated to the PEO. But we're still -- the vast majority are still selling both products because we still think we've seen good opportunity in both of them.\n\n---\n\nOkay. So just the new folks that you're bringing in are dedicated PEO?\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nGot it. And then just on the -- another clarification. Forgive me if I missed this. Just on the HRS guidance in the slides where you show the third quarter, fourth quarter guidance, it looks like it changed a little bit. So what is that -- so just a math -- so it's just on the math kind of thing?\n\n---\n\nYes, Tien-tsin, so what ended up happening when we issued the guidance for the beginning of the year, the attach rates on the health care influenced the range. That's really basically what's going on. So we looked at where we expect to be in the third and fourth quarter and just wanted to tighten the range so that the midpoint obviously is where we think we're going to end up. But that could vary because attach rates on health care can change quarter-to-quarter. It's really -- we're being punctilious.\n\n---\n\nI was just curious, going back to the 1% to 3% client growth, how you guys are thinking about that. It sounds like you kind of answered it already in that the SurePayroll is still growing double-digit, just as far as the mix as the source?\n\n---\n\nWe don't really break it down. I think we're seeing growth on both -- from both of us. They're a little bit faster. Remember, they're a much smaller base from where they're coming from. So we're seeing growth across -- kind of across the board, really.\n\n---\n\nGot it. Okay. And just one last follow-up, if you don't mind. I was just thinking through the kind of profile of the clients that rollout of the Paychex business versus the new sort of class of clients that come in every year. Is that profile, in aggregate, different? Is there anything to think about a client that's leaving the business versus the new client that's coming in? It sounds like maybe a little bit on the average number of employees is turning down a little bit. But aside from that, is there any bigger differences to think about conceptually?\n\n---\n\nNo, not really. I mean, we track to the last $0.01 of revenue we lose, the size of client, what products they have. And it really hasn't changed much.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Thank you. We will close the call. If you're interested in replaying the webcast, it will be archived until around January 19. I thank you for taking the time to participate in our second quarter press release conference call. We're excited about year end, a great time for opportunity to show our clients what we bring them from a service perspective as they close their year, many of them, and certainly, a big time for us in the selling season. And we're excited about all the work that our Paychex employees are doing.\r\nWith that, we wish you all a very happy holiday season, and thank you for joining us.\n\n---\n\nTake care.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: David Togut (Analysts)】\nDo you have any early read on the calendar year-end selling season and client retention?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes, client retention continues to be very strong, so we feel very good, very consistent with that. And the early look, obviously, you don't know until, obviously, we're through January, but it looks good to us. And selling continues to progress well. It is early, particularly in the small market side, to know for sure, but we're -- I think we're off to a good start through November and December. From what we're seeing, we've got full rep headcount. We've got turnover pretty consistent to where we want it to be, and we're feeling, at this point, pretty good about it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Togut (Analysts)】\nWhat is client retention running currently?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nI'd say we're very consistent, still around 82%, which is basically our all-time best.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Togut (Analysts)】\nGot it. And can you quantify for us bookings growth in the November quarter?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nNo, we don't really -- we don't give that out, and we certainly would wait until we get through the selling season before we talk about kind of how it was. We feel pretty good about it though. We mentioned in the first quarter that we felt good about Q1. Q2 was very consistent from a revenue par growth, annualized revenue sold.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Togut (Analysts)】\nCan you quantify growth in checks per client?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes, checks per client were under 1% in the quarter. I had mentioned in previous calls that once we started dipping under 1%, we wouldn't call out the exact tenth of a point. We saw some moderation in checks per client. We're looking at it. It seems to be consistent with what we're seeing in the -- what seems to be happening in the under-50 space, which is around 1%, a little bit under in terms of employment growth. But we'll have to see. It can vary sometimes from quarter-to-quarter. This wasn't a particularly strong quarter from a checks per payroll standpoint.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Togut (Analysts)】\nUnderstood. And then on pricing, can you quantify what the net price increase is running after discounting?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes, I -- David, I wouldn't go any further than to say we're still in that 2% to 4% range. I feel pretty comfortable it's holding, don't see any significant issues there.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Togut (Analysts)】\nUnderstood. Just a quick final question. ADP completes their transition of their small business client base to RUN, they say, by the end of fiscal '15, ending June. What impact will that have, in your view, in terms of direct head-to-head competition versus ADP? And if you could maybe frame that in terms of any new products you have in the small business space.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes, so David, as far as we can understand their strategy, they appear to be obviously moving a lot of people under their RUN platform and also moving a lot of people to an online service model. That has some strengths and some weaknesses associated with it. We think there are challenges in the lower end to operate with that model, and we think we have differentiated service that will compete very well. From a platform perspective, from technology, what they offer versus what we offer in the small market, we feel pretty comfortable we can compete pretty effectively, and we think we've got the better service model.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes, I think, just to add to that, they've been going through this platform change for a while, and I think we've competed very well. In fact, if you kind of look at the gain, the net gain from our numbers, we're gaining slightly from them. We always lose some and take some and I think we're still doing very well, so we don't -- I don't really anticipate much change there. As well as what Efrain said, I think we compete very effectively from the product standpoint. Our SaaS-based products, our online interface and mobility apps, I think, are the best out there right now and we just continue to keep adding to them.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jason Kupferberg (Analysts)】\nI just wanted to start with a follow-up question on the checks per client. I know you said that you expect the slowdown to continue in the second half. What's your sense of kind of where it will actually bottom out? I know it sounds like you're still trying to get to the root cause here, but do you think it could even go negative? And anything you can give us in terms of sort of revenue sensitivity when this metric moves by, I don't know, 50 basis points or 100 basis points.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes, okay. So checks per payroll, when you start getting down below 1%, there's a lot of variability in that number, and it's affected by the mix of what's happening with new clients compared to other clients that are attriting out of the base. I think we're reaching some sort of steady-state here, where that number will oscillate between flat and 1%. That seems to be consistent with what we're seeing in terms of our small business index numbers, and it seems to be implying and -- it's fairly -- you have to be very careful because this is one quarter of data. It seems to be implying that you're reaching some sort of a more moderate state of employment in the small market space. We had 2 or 3 years of really strong checks per payroll and employment growth in the small business space. It seems like that's starting to moderate. The impact on revenue, so what I'd like to say is if you have about 1 point growth in checks, that's typically going to give you anywhere from 25 basis points to 50 basis points, depending on the mix in revenue. So it should be relatively modest, and we should settle in somewhere in that range.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jason Kupferberg (Analysts)】\nAnd that will be specifically for the core payroll?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes, it mostly affects payroll service revenue, yes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jason Kupferberg (Analysts)】\nBut the 25 to 50 bps is specific to that line, not your total revenue.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes, that's correct. Yes, that's correct. Sorry.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jason Kupferberg (Analysts)】\nOkay. Just wanted to clarify that and then -- no, I had another question, but do you want to finish your answer?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nOkay, okay, yes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jason Kupferberg (Analysts)】\nSo just on the CPA referral channel, I know you had mentioned last quarter that you were penetrating some newer CPAs, but I wanted to see if there's any update in terms of latest data on percent of your new sales coming from the CPA network or what percent of them are exclusive to Paychex for payroll referrals. And is there any uptick in competition for this channel?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes, I think it's been pretty consistent competition in the channel. What we were -- what we've done is kind of change the sales force around a bit to have some CPA-centric reps. So where we have a lot of concentration of CPAs in the past, we hadn't done that. We have been pretty clean on the territory of who owned the territory and kind of everything in it. So we've added more dedicated reps just to that CPA channel. It think it's early in that process, but we continue to get a majority of our referrals -- not a majority, a large sense of our referrals from CPAs, and that's been fairly consistent at times. I think it's competitive. I think it's picked up maybe a little bit from a competitive standpoint, meaning from one competitor. There's really not many that go after that channel, it's really 2 of us. And I think there's probably been a little bit more competition from an incentive to the CPA, I guess, I'd say. But we're still -- I still feel good about that and I think we'll have the best sense of that after third quarter.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jason Kupferberg (Analysts)】\nThat's fair. Just last question on the margins, x float income, obviously, running around 39% through the first half of the year. You've got the typical, I guess, seasonal headwinds in the second half. I know you're still endorsing the full year range of 37% to 38%, but should we be thinking about the upper part of that range being more likely? Or does it feel more like kind of right down the middle sort of year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nFeels right down the middle sort of year right now, Jason.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Georgios Mihalos (Analysts)】\nEfrain, I know you don't want to get too specific as it relates to pricing, but I think on the first quarter call you would mention that pricing trends were kind of trending toward the midpoint of your 2% to 4% range. Would you care to update that at all? Or...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nI'd care to reiterate what I said.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes, I think what we see, George, is very consistent there. So we're holding -- and we really feel like we're holding the price and the price increase and nothing's really changed in Q2 from Q1.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Georgios Mihalos (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then I know it's early days here in the selling season, but would you categorize what you're seeing so far as ahead of expectations, in line with your expectations?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nIt's hard to say. I think I'd say certainly in line, if not a little positive, a little above. But it's early. But we -- you never know, especially in the small business market, because so much of it is done at the last minute and we get a lot of sales in at the last minute. But right now, I'd say certainly at expectations or a little above.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Georgios Mihalos (Analysts)】\nOkay. And just last question for me, I just want to make sure I understand it. The deferment of some payroll revenue from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, can you just remind us again what's driving that? And have we seen that before? Or is something going on here that's a little different?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nWell, yes. So let me explain that in 2 ways. So if you look at last year's results from payroll service revenue, we started the year relatively low, 2.4%, accelerated in Qs 2 and 3 and then ended the year at 3%. That had to do with days. This really didn't have anything to do with days compare. It's simply that cutoffs in a given quarter may affect where revenue falls on the edge of one quarter or another. We looked at -- there's 14 revenue streams that comprise payroll service revenue. As we looked at it, our best estimate is that some revenue that we would otherwise see in Q3 because of timing is going to fall in Q4 this quarter. So these things happen. It doesn't always happen. But if you look at the payroll service revenue line over the last couple of years, you'll see it bouncing up and down, not because it's that variable, but timing can affect it, days can affect it, and that's why I cautioned that you really need to look at the year as a whole.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Joseph Foresi (Analysts)】\nI guess, my first question here is could you give us some sense of what the client growth was like this quarter? I know you talked about the checks per payroll, but I was wondering how has that been trending.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes. So Joe, what we said was we had a goal of growing clients 1% to 3%. We certainly feel pretty comfortable about where we are in that range. And we got off to a good start through the first 6 months. Feel like we're on track in terms of where we expect to be in the year in that range.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Joseph Foresi (Analysts)】\nGot it. And then the year-over-year revenue growth has ticked up over the last couple of quarters. Can you give us a sense of how much of that is associated with this, I guess, either new business or penetrating your own businesses versus the general macro backdrop?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nWell, I think it's probably a little bit of all. When I'm asked that question, I'd say we could statistically say it's 95% execution. The reality is you need a better environment. So the environment is better. Our execution is better. Pricing is little bit better, and the opportunity in the under-50 space overall is better and we're executing better against it. So I think it's a mix of all of those issues. I would say, though, that our execution on the sales side has been really strong and it's been strong for a number of quarters now, and we feel pretty comfortable about where we are positioned competitively.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes, I agree.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Joseph Foresi (Analysts)】\nAre there any -- I mean, I guess, just 2 parts to the last question. Any metrics that you can provide that you'd like to share with us about the execution on the sales front? And then the second part of that question is more of a competitive one, a lot of general arena or any change in the competitive environment.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nI'll take the last part and then turn it over to Efrain. I think we've seen the -- certainly, some of the -- more competitors showing up in that mid-market space in particular, and -- but I think we're doing well against them. In fact, we've -- you're -- they're going to pick off some clients at some point because they're new in the market and they've got something to show. What we've done is started to win back some already, which we think is a very positive thing. And overall, it's not having any sizable difference to us. So I think while they're out there, I think we've invested very well in the past, particularly the past 3 or 4 years, and it rolled out a lot of product now that I think has positioned us very well against competitors. So I don't -- while they're out there, we still have the widest breadth of services to offer and certainly the best service and service options, along with the mobility and when you think about all the interconnection. It depends on the client. But when you think about all of the service offerings that we have to connect you in the -- a platform of 401(k), payroll, HR administration, time and attendance, et cetera, it makes us much better from a competitive standpoint. Efrain?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nI'd say the other thing, Joe, is that we call it out in the press release. While we don't give the specifics, when we get to year end, you can calculate the number. We talk about revenue per check, and revenue per check is just a combination of a number of things. It obviously includes pricing. But I think what you're seeing there is sales to a little bit bigger client on the core payroll side and more sales of precisely the kinds of products that Marty just mentioned to that sales force. Our cross-selling abilities have never been better, and our team selling has never been better. So I think it's all of those working in combination. And while it's easy to look at just what's happening in payroll service revenue and ignore what's happening in HRS, the reality is that they're -- you have to look at both, and our growth rate is a combination of ability to do both of those things well.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kartik Mehta (Analysts)】\nBoth of you talked about the selling season being good, and I think you've given some thoughts behind why. And I was wondering, if you look at the fundamentals or at least the fundamentals you look at to determine if it will be a good selling season or not, how have those trended? And what are some of those fundamentals that you would look at to kind of predict how the selling season is going to go?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes, I think, one, at this early stage, obviously, you look at submitted. We don't get into that amount of detail, but you look at what kind of sales have been submitted already. And as Efrain mentioned, that's not only payroll, but that's the PEO business, the 401(k) business, et cetera, because you get a sense of those a little bit earlier and even in small business payroll. And things look pretty solid to us. Well, the other thing you look at is what's the -- it's a little more subjective. What's the pulse of the sales folks and the sales leadership, and it's pretty strong right now. As Efrain mentioned, we've got great team selling going on. We've got retention in good place. We've got full reps all out there. All positions are filled. In fact, we're a little slightly over, so all the positions are up and running. Leads are coming in very well. So I think all those early signs, we hate to talk about it until the third quarter is kind of over and you get a sense of it, but it's a pretty good sense right now of what we're seeing, and again, you really got to see January to know, but it's a good sense. And competitively, we feel very good. There's not a lot of things that are popping up competitively that are saying, hey, there is someone out there with a real aggressive pricing like we've had years ago that was really taking some share at a very low price or high, high discounting or something. We're not seeing anything like that. So we feel we're competing very well and the products are going over really well. The retention also looks good at this point. So you don't know again. But again, retention, we're at our best ever and that feels good.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kartik Mehta (Analysts)】\nAnd Marty, in the press release, you talked about the minimum premium health plan, that doing really well. Is that strictly a reflection of ACA and what your customers are trying to do? Or are there other drivers helping that business grow?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nI think talking about that plan and specifically to the PEO, when we introduced it in the last half of last year, I think what that really implies is the PEO is doing well. So right now, in the marketplace, PEOs come on very strong and we certainly have felt that kind of from the end of last year through this year. Little slow at the beginning of the year starting, but we seem to be picking up great momentum. I think some of that, Kartik, is definitely health care reform. They're looking for the strength of coming into a co-employment position. But I also think we're having great sales execution on the PEO side. We also -- we expanded it so we're selling -- while you still sell the majority in PEO kind of \"states,\" we're selling it nationwide and we're getting very good sales execution on the PEO side. Something we've been in a long time, but we think the product and the sales team are really kind of hitting at their peak right now.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kartik Mehta (Analysts)】\nAnd then just one last question. Efrain, on the float portfolio, any thoughts about changing investment strategy or any other aspects of it, considering the rate environment?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes, you know, Kartik, that's a good question. So our duration now is 3.2 and our yield's about 1.6% on the long end of the portfolio. You can see, if you look at that line, that we're ticking up gradually. We obviously invest differently than ADP does. We don't push everything out longer term. Look, we have a conversation about that in the spring. We'll take a look at it. I don't anticipate any major changes. We were very, very positive about rate changes 3 to 4 weeks ago, and now I'm thinking that while we see some rate changes there, they're going to be moderate. And so you're going to have to think about how you position the portfolio in that environment, and we may be there for a longer period of time. So yes, we'll give some thought to that as we get into the back half of the year. I don't anticipate a significant shift, but it looks like we're -- we've got low interest rates here for some more time given the collapse in oil prices.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gary Bisbee (Analysts)】\nI guess, on the HRS revenue growth, you had -- you'd given, and I guess you've updated this morning, this chart of how adding in the new health plan changes the growth rates. And that chart sort of implies 4% acceleration Q1 to Q2 in HRS revenue. Is that really why we see the acceleration? Or is the underlying momentum in the business adjusting out the impact that the revenue recognition change is having? Has it really picked up momentum?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nWe saw some improvement in the second quarter. So we had -- versus first quarter, Gary. So we had strong performance literally against every single product line. And insurance, which started a little soft in the first quarter for us, had a good, good quarter. In the second quarter, we expect that to continue. So we anticipate that will continue to have strong performance through the balance of the year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gary Bisbee (Analysts)】\nRight. And so the deceleration implied in the back half is more just how it flows through and then starting to lap some of that revenue being in last year, not anything about underlying.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes. No, no, no, sorry, Gary, I probably misunderstood your question. That's correct. So what happens is, in the back half, you anniversary the changes in the minimum premium plan. By the time you get to the third quarter, you're getting about roughly about half of the impact. And by the time you're in fourth quarter, you've anniversary-ed it completely.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gary Bisbee (Analysts)】\nAnd then on the PEO, and more broadly, HRS strength, I mean, there are several competitors that are public now that we see PEO seems to be doing terrific everywhere. Do you have any -- and obviously, there seems to be some benefit from health reform. But do you have any fears that, that sort of demand is being pulled forward with everyone doing well or it sets up really difficult comparisons once we get into calendar 2015 and more of the mid-market customer, they have to be in compliance, and so then you've sort of done that? Or has this got people really more willing to consider the benefits of this model and you think that the momentum can remain for a while?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes, at some point, the growth itself in PEO will slow down a bit. It's early to talk about where we are in terms of '16. But we've had a strong 1.5 years with respect to PEO. We'll see where we end the year. Marty was mentioning about sales season. Sales season in Q3 is important for the PEO, so where we end up there will give us a good indication of where we are from '16. And I'll let Marty talk specifically about Employee -- Employer Shared Responsibility, which is also an important component of our thought process. But it certainly gets the conversation about PEO's going in a way that probably was different than 2 or 3 years ago.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nI think also I -- as Efrain said, obviously, when you look year-over-year and when you get into '16, there'll be tougher comparisons on the PEO side. But I think we're very -- still very early stage on health care reform. As Efrain mentioned, our health care reform product is just starting to pick up steam now and we really had it in place before anybody a year ago. But with all the delays in the changes in the regulations, I think it took a while to get going. But we're seeing a nice pickup now from healthcare reform, whether it's PEO or not. And I think this will just add to it. So I think it's still pretty early and I think this will give us some growth for, certainly, for the rest of this year and then into next year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gary Bisbee (Analysts)】\nGreat. And then just one last one. On the strong HRS growth, has -- if we look today versus, say, 2 or 3 years ago, has the mix of what's coming up-sell to existing customers who may have already been a payroll client versus new customers that just want these services and you sell them because they're interested in the HRS maybe more than being legacy payroll, has that changed at all? Or is it really the same mix and sales process that you've been executing for [indiscernible]\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nWell, yes, it's similar in ways, although I think a couple of things have picked up. One, Efrain mentioned insurance and health insurance has picked up particularly recently. And so that's an area that started to pick up again. I think 401(k) was very strong a few years ago, and it's kind of leveled out. It's got nice growth. But the fastest-growing is HR outsourcing, whether it be the PEO model or the ASO model or our kind of phone support model. All of those, I think -- the HR support has seen the fastest growth in the last 2 years anyway, and that's picked up a little bit faster in the mix of things. And I think that's just the fact that you've seen HR outsourcing and the complexity of HR come down in the client base. So where it used to be, that was the 50-plus or at least 30- or 40-plus, that's coming down more and more into where we have a lot of clients. And so I think we've gotten very good at selling the value of HR support at various levels to smaller clients. And Efrain mentioned earlier the team selling approach that we've gone through, which is if a client is of a certain size, we go in with multiple sales teams together on the front end instead of coming at them after they have payroll, I think, has also helped get that growth going higher.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Timothy McHugh (Analysts)】\nI guess, can you update us, I guess, at this point in terms of how much is the sales force or your sales resources kind of up year-over-year as we go into the selling season? And is that a fair bogey for how you think about -- I know you said 1% to 3% client growth for this fiscal year but a lot of that was dictated by last selling season. So I'm trying to get a sense for how we should ballpark kind of what the potential is for this upcoming season in terms of client growth.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nWell, I -- yes, I think from a sales headcount perspective, I'd say it's up around 4%, maybe 4% plus a little bit. So a little stronger. Then we were kind of holding constant for a few years. Last year, we were up a bit, and this year, we went up again across the various sales organizations, around 4%, 4% plus or a little bit over 4%.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nI didn't catch the second question, back half of the...\n\n---\n\n【質問: Timothy McHugh (Analysts)】\nAnd is it fair to think about the target, and I guess, for client growth, it will be around that number? I know you said 1% to 3% for this fiscal year, but I would assume most of that was driven by last year's kind of selling season.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nNo, I will just start by saying remember, that sales team is across all divisions. So it's not so much on the payroll growth as we've probably seen more increases in the HRS teams as well. And also, we've moved up some of the virtual sales teams on some of the products like time and attendance and merchant services and so forth as well. So it's a mix across that, Tim. So I wouldn't say that, that necessarily has given you anything on the client growth. The client growth, we still think we're in that 1% to 3%, okay? Efrain, you fair [ph] with that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Timothy McHugh (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then the new PEO or kind of the new health insurance product, I get a lot of the focus -- I mean, there's an accounting impact of just adding that in there, but how's the client reaction, I guess, been as we look back at this point? It feels like it's been adopted a little more broadly even than you would have thought. And I think the follow-up is, how -- what does that imply? I think you only started doing this in a few markets initially. So do you get more aggressive with rolling this out?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes, I think of it as really 2 different -- I just don't want to mix up 2 different things there. There's the health care plan, where we took on more in the PEO, and that was primarily in Florida and that's the market that we're trying it there. So you're right there, we're doing it in Florida. We're getting good feedback on that. That gives us more flexibility on the rates and the whole process of how we sell and so forth. We've gotten good feedback on that and that's part of our PEO growth, I believe, that you'll see continue. On the health care reform specifically, we've introduced the product across the country. And that's not just PEO, that's to all clients. And it's various products of helping them, but primarily helping them understand and give them reporting on the number of clients that they have as full-time equivalents, whether health care applies to them. If it does apply to them, do they have all the right things in place and how were they going to file the requirements of the health -- of the Affordable Care Act? So I would say both -- they're a little bit different. I don't know if you were combining them or not. But the PEO is going well there in Florida, in particular, where we introduced that plan. And then the health care reform products, as we talk about, is really the reporting and the compliance, and that's across the country. And that's really -- this second quarter just started to really start to pick up some steam. So we're anxious to see how Q3 goes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Timothy McHugh (Analysts)】\nOkay, right. Yes, I was talking more of the Florida product. I guess, what would you want to see to take that more broadly across the rest of the country?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nIt's just a matter of can you get the right plans in place and is the risk reasonable for us to take on. This is where we're taking on more of the risks ourselves, and we felt it was certainly a very big PEO market when you think of really 2 or 3 key states for PEO, at least right now, that was a good one to take on. It was worth it because of the size of the market, the number of sales we have there and, of course, the plan we're able to get and work out through the Florida Blue. So we continue to look at those all the time, and we're looking at them around the country as to whether that's the right move or not. It's the combination of all those things.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Timothy McHugh (Analysts)】\nOkay. And if I could slip in one more, there's just this week news of a new legislation around that PEO sector in terms of having some certification and kind of clarifying some of the tax implications of adopting a PEO, I believe. Can you give us your thoughts on, is that meaningful as you think about the growth of that business?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nSo you're talking about, I think it's called SBEA, another great government acronym. At the margin, it's positive for PEOs. It recognizes them as an important solution within the marketplace. There was some ambiguity about how the government was going to look at PEOs. And we think that it's just going to make the attractiveness of that offering greater in the marketplace. We're digesting all of the provisions of the legislation, and we -- but we think at this point, our compliance group, legal group, think it's going to be a positive for PEO.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Smittipon Srethapramote (Analysts)】\nSo there's been a lot of attention on the growth in the FSA and HSA accounts in the U.S. Can you talk about what role you expect Paychex to play going forward, whether it's continuing to work with partners or becoming more directly involved? And how big an opportunity could this market be?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes, I think FSA has come under some pressure because of some of the changes on it and so forth in legislation and the deductibility of it and everything. I think that's going to slow down a little, but I think HSAs will become stronger. I think that what you'll see there is it gives us more opportunity because I think more health plans, and this could be through the agency as well, through our insurance agency. You'll see more health plans go more toward HSA deductibles and then giving HSA money to employees. I think it's an opportunity for us. I don't know how -- if it's going to be a major impact at this point, but -- and I think you'll see us do a combination of -- probably always partnering to some degree with it because of the backroom requirements of it just make more sense sometimes to partner than to build. But we've been in FSA for a long time, I think we'll be able to handle it very well, and it'll continue to be part of our package.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Smittipon Srethapramote (Analysts)】\nGreat. And then maybe just a follow-up on the partnerships that you have developed with companies like Elavon. Can you talk about how that partnership in payment processing is going and if there's any other type of -- similar types of partnerships in the pipeline?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes, I think the Elavon partnership has gone well. We were a little slow out of the gate on the selling of merchant services. I think we felt that the field sales would be able to sell that well and they were first in for some new businesses, and so they'd be able to sell it. It turns out we learned a lot in different trials on that, that it's a complicated pricing structure based on your type of business and so forth, and very competitive. So what we found was we now have the field sales team refer back into an internal team, which we increased the size this year, and they're doing very well. So we've gotten some real traction this year on the inside team that sells basically virtually. So the field sales refers it back into an inside team, who then talks to the client and sells the credit card, the merchant processing. And that started to pick up some real steam. Now it takes a lot of clients, given the commission structures there, to have substantial revenue given our revenue size. But we do think it's got great momentum, and we're continuing to see that. So it's been a nice partnership, and I think it's starting to take off. Other partnerships like that -- can't think of too many, other than Paychex Accounting Online. We've invested in -- with Kashoo in the Paychex Accounting Online. Again, a little slow getting going. I think we're learning a lot about the marketing of the product and how to integrate it more into the marketing. Our clients still view us very much as the human resource outsource -- human resource -- human capital management, payroll and HR and time and attendance. And getting them to view us as an accounting offering as well with the Kashoo product has been slower than we thought. So we're learning on that, but we're always open to that. And of course, Brazil is a 50-50 partnership with Semco down there to help us get started. And I think just starting in January, we're off to a pretty good start. I wouldn't give a client count at this point, but it's starting to pick up traction as well, and we feel very good about that decision.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sara Gubins (Analysts)】\nI have a question about the new platform. I had a chance to take a look at it at the recent HR tech conference and was particularly interested about the Flex enterprise platform for larger clients. I know it's really early, but I'm wondering what the feedback has been from the sales force in early demos and if you think that, that is now fully competitive with some of the more recent entrants, at least, from -- to the public market.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes, I think we do -- obviously, we've been able to show it at some of the shows, and the sales force is really picking up steam on it now, I think. We sold another platform for a long time, so there was a lot of learning there, and we've been enhancing it very quickly. The thing that changes so quickly today is when you release something, almost every month, there's a new release that's adding something to it. And so that's probably been the biggest challenge for the sales force is all the changes to it that we've been adding. That's a good thing because it's added enhancements. Got a good feedback on it. I think the clients really like the way it shows. The user interface is very simple and very direct for them. We're working on integrating more and more of the other products that we have into that. So it's -- there is a full suite of products. And combined with that great user interface and the mobility platform and multiple products that are going anywhere from recruiting, on-boarding, to payroll, to HR administration, time and attendance, all of that's bundled in. And we're giving more service options now between user interface, the mobility and 24/7 client service. I think the differentiator will be technology to some degree, but it will also be the great service that we can provide that I don't think anyone else is focused on. So it's getting good traction with the sales force, and we're anxious to see the January results.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sara Gubins (Analysts)】\nGreat. Following up kind of on that theme of being able to do payroll in a lot of different forms. Given all of the updates that you've been making to mobile and your platforms, are you starting to see -- or are you continuing to see a shift towards more online entry as opposed to phone and fax? Is there anything appreciable really happening there? And if there is, do you think that we might see an operating margin benefit over time from that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nI think we are seeing some shift toward that, and it's interesting. Particularly, we just saw like a big shift in mobility for like the holiday, for Thanksgiving. So you're seeing it around certain times where -- and which is exactly what we like, where the client has a choice each and every week or every other week, whenever they do payroll. They can go mobility this week. They can go online next week. They always have their dedicated, personalized service to fall back on whenever they need it, and they can just call up and give their payroll over the phone as well. So we're seeing some shift, but the thing that we're seeing that's very positive to us is that clients are using the multitude of options available to them, which is what we wanted to give. We don't want to force them to online. We don't want to force them away from a payroll specialist who gives us the great retention numbers that we have. So I think there certainly has been some opportunities there, and you'll see us -- with our industry-leading margins, you'll see us continue to find ways to keep those. You may find us reinvesting, as we have the last 4 years though, right back into technology because it's going to be this combination of service and technology that makes us successful.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sara Gubins (Analysts)】\nGreat. And then just last quick question. Last quarter, you talked about an uptick to -- in sales to new start-ups. You mentioned your continued strength in the under 50, and I'm wondering if that sales to start-ups continued this quarter.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes, it did. We continue to see a positive uptick compared to last year. And so we're still seeing -- the new business start-ups, as you know, I'm sure, still are not back to what they were prerecession levels, but they certainly have ticked up over 700,000. They're just not quite back up, from everything we see, back up over that 800,000 level kind of countrywide. So we're encouraged that we're seeing more sales from new businesses, and that's always been a big part of our business. So yes, that has continued in Q2.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Bryan Keane (Analysts)】\nMost of my questions have been asked and answered, but I just want to look at the big picture. Maybe Marty, when you look at payroll services growth and HR services growth and you look at the guidance, is that the right model for growth rates? Or are you leaving some growth on the table? Just kind of how do you think about the big picture as we go out for the next couple of years?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nWell, is it the right model? I think we'll always see the HR service revenue growth growing faster. And I think that we -- what the good thing is there, Bryan, is that we've got a lot of opportunity for -- when you think of the penetration rates that we're at. So even as long as we've been in this business and successful at selling into that base, we still have low penetration rates in a lot of services, right from 401(k) to insurances and so forth. So I think you'll always see that, that growth is higher. I think the interesting thing, approaching $1 billion in revenue in HRS is really exciting to us and going well beyond that. Payroll service revenue growth is always going to be somewhat tied to the economy, but we feel like we're executing well on everything that we can control. And I think you'll see frankly a blending more of that. It won't be so much about how much is payroll service revenue growth and how much is HRS growth but how much is the combined service revenue growth. And we're trying to continue to drive that to upper -- into a consistent upper-single digits kind of place to be. And given that, we then keep those margins up and expanding, and we've got something very unique here. So we're excited about how we're executing and certainly about the opportunity in front of us.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Bryan Keane (Analysts)】\nWhat's the acquisition pipeline look like? And is there any appetite to take on larger deals moving forward?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes, there is. We've come close on a few. I think that the tricky thing is the valuation. A lot of these things in the pipeline are priced or valued at almost what I would say is a perfect acquisition. So it doesn't leave you a lot of room for error, in our opinion. We've been very successful at the product tuck-ins and the acquisitions like SurePayroll that we've done, and so we're very careful about what we acquire. But the pipeline is pretty good. It's just the valuation has got to be right or we're just -- we're not going to do it. But we've got the cash and the flexibility, and I think we've got a nice track record of executing. So we're pretty aggressive about looking at everything that's out there right now.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Bryan Keane (Analysts)】\nAnd would everything be in kind of the HR area? Or is there certain other maybe verticals that you guys would look at?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nI would say, pretty much anything that we're into right now would be in our space. So anything from payroll to PEO and product tuck-ins, but certainly, larger deals as well. And like I said, we've come pretty close, but the valuations are pretty steep. And so again, if we don't feel like we can make that difference, we're going to be pretty disciplined in our pricing.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Macdonald (Analysts)】\nJust a couple of quick follow-ups. On the HRS growth, if I remember right, the 401(k) restatements may have had some impact in the quarter. Could you talk about that? And was it confined to this quarter?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nJim, it's part of your decision on pricing. HRS was strong for -- in virtually every single line. You make a decision as to whether you want to take that pricing or not. But in the 401(k) business in particular, we had higher assets or moved to bigger plans. And that certainly played some part in it and will continue to play a part for the remainder of the year, but that's not the sole thing driving growth in that business.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Macdonald (Analysts)】\nRight. I was just trying to figure out if that was a little more than normal this quarter.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nIt was a little bit more than normal this quarter. But again, 401(k), part of the way that we make money in that business is a number of different streams, and all of them were up.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Macdonald (Analysts)】\nGreat, and another follow-up. So just on the new Flex product, could you talk a little bit more about what your primary -- or where you think it'll sell the best? Which size and range of customer?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes, I think we're seeing mostly anywhere from 20 and up. 15 to 20 and up is probably going to be seeing that the most. This is where they -- the good news is I think that's probably even lower than we had expected for a full suite of the products. Now Flex can encompass as little as payroll and as large as the entire suite. And so I think that -- but overall, when you see multiple products being purchased as a bundle, it's in that 20-plus, which is I think a little stronger than we expected. And I think that that's because, again, the market's changing and things are coming down, the need for HR administration, time and attendance, particularly as the technologies made it better. We just introduced Paychex Time, which I mentioned. And here's a mobile punch that now allows you to go in and punch and actually keep the punch, keep your time open on your mobile phone for 70 -- up to 72 hours. So you don't have to log in again, get into your mobile app as an employee and then punch in. You can actually leave it open for multiple time periods. As that stuff gets easier and easier, we're finding smaller businesses are finding big benefits, so we're able to sell them on the big benefits. So we're excited about Flex and the fact that it kind of bundles all this together along with the service options. It's appealing to 20 and above, but certainly, it has some -- it certainly fits even below that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Grossman (Analysts)】\nJust a couple of very quick follow-ups. I was just wondering, are you -- I assume you track -- or some kind of tracking of revenue per client. And I'm wondering if you could help us understand how that has been trending, given all the changes in the underlying services and some of the enhancements to the products that you're making to kind of accommodate a bundled type of sale.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes, it's been trending positively, David. I think that what Marty was saying earlier about team selling and cross-selling, I think we've just gotten much better at understanding what a client's needs are based on size, putting the right set of solutions in front of them. And because we have breadth of service -- I'm sorry, breadth of product offering that's pretty unrivaled, we can typically get a client the solution they need from the first instance, which is a little different than what we were doing probably 4 or 5 years ago, where we would wait for payroll and then do the sales sequentially. So look, I'll wait until the end of the year to quantify it, but we're pretty pleased in terms of the revenue uplift that we've been getting per client. So what that implies is that the game no longer is just to simply get units and then add ancillaries, which is what we talked about 5, 6 years ago. It's really get the revenue on the initial sale for the right kind of client, and we're executing pretty well against that strategy.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Grossman (Analysts)】\nIs there any way that you can disaggregate how much of that phenomenon is contributing to your growth rate? And I guess, on the same line, can you help us understand the margin profile of those clients versus what they look like historically, where you were going in, sell payroll and other services on top of it?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes. So margin profile is not significantly different from what we've seen historically. If you go back 4 or 5 years, our operating income net of float was about 400 basis points lower than it is right now. So we obviously have been able to execute that strategy and grow margins at the same time, that's one. To disaggregate it, I need to give you year-end client data, and then you need to compute what average revenue per client is. So you can get a sense of that if you do that analysis from last year. I won't -- we'll probably update that at the end of the year, but we're getting a pretty nice revenue uplift. And the issue is that we think that, that -- we can continue to execute that strategy into the future.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Grossman (Analysts)】\nAnd maybe just a related question as it relates to the margin. As you think about these acquisitions that are out there -- and I know valuation's a separate issue. But as you think about that as well as some of the enhancements you're making to the platform and some of these newer segments that you're going after, is the company perhaps thinking more holistically about kind of the margin in terms of that balance between growth and margin? Or has there really been no change internally about that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nWell, yes, sure. I mean, I think we're always looking at -- we're trying to get that consistent upper-single-digit growth in the top line and continue to be very shareholder-friendly on the bottom. So we'll have high margins, but it is a balance. If we see a good opportunity to drive growth that might hurt the margin a little bit, then we would -- we're not going to hesitate to do that. It's always going to be a balance though. We want to drive both, but if in the short term it hurts you a little bit, I think we're willing to be able to do that. So we're investing -- I think what we've been very successful at over the last particularly 4 years is driving margin improvement and also investing very heavily in technology, and I see it along the same lines. We drove cost out of operations, we got very productive, tried new things and still got us a great client retention and satisfaction. And we funneled out those dollars into technology, where we were behind 4 or 5 years ago, and put us in a great spot from a technology position, now in a competitive situation. So we see the same thing with an acquisition. Hey, if we're going to take it or -- and it takes on some additional expense, where else are we going to be able to cut to be able to offset it?\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Grossman (Analysts)】\nRight. And just one last thing then. Going to the international expansion, this has been a long road for you guys, starting in Germany years ago and you now have this joint venture in Brazil. I mean, are you getting any more encouraged or less encouraged about the ability for the model to be expanded outside the U.S.? And could you share any insights into kind of where your head's at in terms of kind of taking this into other geographies?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes, I think we'd like to -- as a team, we talked about the strategy a few years ago and decided, hey, look, let's try to pinpoint 3 or 4 countries, tops. Let's get our thing -- let's get it growing. I think there wasn't a focus on it. For quite a while, it was kind of a nice idea but was not always a focus. We started focusing on it. We really doubled the size of Germany through acquisition and through additional salespeople. So we're pretty encouraged there and think that there's still opportunity there, but it has moved slower than we expected. But frankly, their culture is slower to still outsource than we had expected. But -- so we feel pretty good about the fact that I think acquisitions are opening up as well as the opportunities for sales there. In Brazil, having only been there less than a year really, I think we've learned a lot. It's also a little bit slow to come out from the CPA or the client doing it. So we've worked a very good process in with becoming the CPA's backroom. I think that's brought down the revenue per client less than we expected, but it's helped to accelerate the growth in blocks. So you go to a CPA and you take their business, you build credibility with the CPA, then we'll move into the direct sales to the client because we'll have market share and credibility. And that's actually picking up some nice traction. And Semco has helped, I think, knowing Brazil and partnering. That was a different approach than Germany, where we kind of -- it took us a long time because we did it ourselves. And then we're still looking at 1 or 2 countries where we can get in either through acquisition or start-up, primarily probably through acquisition. And we think we're trying to build it to where it's meaningful to our revenue, which is difficult given where we're growing, but I still think it's a nice opportunity.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jeffrey Silber (Analysts)】\nI know it's late. I just wanted to ask one question. Efrain, I think you had mentioned earlier the potential impact of oil prices on your thoughts regarding interest rates. Are there any -- is there any other impact potentially on the rest of the business from the decline in oil prices?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nNo, I highlighted that because, obviously, it's had an impact on the Fed's thinking around interest rates. I was just reading an article before the call around what they expect to see in terms of consumer uplift. It's hard to peg any of that to have a direct impact on our business. So no, it shouldn't have an impact.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes, we're hoping that it brings up, at least in the short term, some consumer confidence, which may -- gives them some discretionary income to spend and might bring small businesses up. Plus, it's going to help small businesses a bit as it works through, depending on the business. And so hopefully, it has some positive impact, but we haven't seen too much yet.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jeffrey Silber (Analysts)】\nAnd do you have any specific geographic exposure to the states in the U.S. that have a lot of energy production?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nWe're seeing -- overall, from our small business index, we are seeing that the central part of the U.S. is where we're seeing the best small business job growth because you're seeing increased jobs in the drilling and fracking and so forth. And that's the central, it's anywhere from Texas to North Dakota. So it's interesting that they're having kind of the best job growth rate now, where the coasts have calmed down some. But I wouldn't say it's had any a dramatic effect, but I think that it's been a positive, but mostly in the Central U.S.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jeffrey Silber (Analysts)】\nYes, I was actually looking at it from the opposite perspective with the decline in oil prices, if you've seen a slowdown in job growth there.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nNo, not that we've seen. No, we have not seen that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Siva Borra (Analysts)】\nFirstly, how should we think about revenue per check? And probably just following on one of the earlier questions, when you think about it, it is dependent on pricing but also the kind of product portfolio you have. What is the price differential between the most basic versions of products which you're selling compared to a full-blown operation? And what kind of penetration levels do you have like if, let's say, put 100 figure to the most basic product to, say, 20% or 30% penetration of the full portfolio? So if you could probably give any numbers around that, that would be helpful.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes, well, S.K., I think the best way -- let me start with the end and then come back to revenue per check. So obviously, we think that revenue per check has been going up and will continue to grow. If you look at each of the product lines we have -- and I say this frequently, Marty does too -- that we have about 10% on average of the base penetrated right now. That's what generating the HRS revenue. So I'll let you figure out in your model what that equates to, but certainly, we think 10% is pretty under-penetrated for the base. And there's probably multiples of that kind of opportunity that exists within the base, ignoring whether you get growth in the base, which we think we'll get over time. With respect to each of the products, it really -- it depends on the product. When you attach an HR outsourcing solution to a payroll client, you're getting multiple Xs of that payroll client's revenue, and that ranges anywhere from 1x to 2x on a 401(k) plan. As I said, multiple Xs of that payroll revenue in an HR outsourcing solution. So it will really vary depending on where the opportunity is and the rate of penetration by product, but we think we still have a long way to go in terms of getting to the point where we've saturated the base with the suite of products that we have.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Siva Borra (Analysts)】\nOkay. I just have one other question. For the last few years, you have been excessively investing in products and the point which Marty was mentioning about continuous investments in technology. And this year, you invested quite a lot around sales and marketing. So when do you expect a more normalized investment year? Is it going to be FY '16, FY '17? Yes, any views on that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nI think you'll always see some growth in the -- from a sales and marketing perspective, I think, just to keep up with the competitive environment. I think it's fairly normalized. There wasn't a huge increase in sales and marketing. But I think when things are kind of at a normal pace, we're typically trying to grow the sales force by 3% or so. From a technology standpoint, the increase, the level of increase has slowed, and I think it will be why you can always spend millions more on technology. I think we've got a great product portfolio and road map that we invest in and have tried to slow down the increase of spending, but the level of spending will probably stay relatively the same. So I think we're in kind of a normalized -- we're kind of heading into a normalized period right now.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Marcon (Analysts)】\nA couple of quick questions. Just on the PEO side, when you're getting new clients, are you typically seeing brand-new clients to the overall solution? Or what -- or how many of the new clients that you're getting are competitive takeaways? How would you describe that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nI think I would say, it's kind of 50-50. I think we're selling into the base as well as brand-new clients on the PEO concept. So I'd say probably -- and it varies month to month, but probably around 50-50 is fair. I think we're putting a little bit more emphasis on brand-new clients because I think there's a real opportunity out there. I think our sales force is executing well and really can sell the benefits of the PEO to a brand-new client. And it's part of, as Efrain has mentioned a number of times, this kind of team selling. So you don't necessarily have to go in and just sell them payroll or our old model. It's selling them a complete suite if they need it and value it. So you'll see us focus probably some reps just on PEO selling outside the base.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Marcon (Analysts)】\nGreat. And I mean, obviously, there's a couple of states that are well-penetrated. In terms of the -- outside of those core 2, 3 states that are really well-penetrated, are you seeing an increasing level of acceptance of the PEO concept?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes, and I think this legislation that Efrain mentioned earlier may accelerate that a little bit, too. But I think so, yes, where it's typically Florida, Texas, let's say Georgia. I think even New York now is starting to pick up and some other states that we really haven't seen that much growth before. So I think there is more acceptance, and I think the legislation will make that even better.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Marcon (Analysts)】\nGreat. And then on the competitive takeaways, on the PEO side, what's the primary reason why somebody would come to you from a competitive perspective?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nI think the insurance plans that we have, I think, as well as the service and then the technology of the product that you have. And I think when you look at a few of us that are in the PEO business, I mean, there's only a few that really have that wide breadth of it. Also, there is -- you really got to count on somebody large, and I think sometimes people go into the -- there's a lot of small PEOs. I think clients go in there, thinking they're going to get something that in the end they can't provide from a service and technology perspective, and just a safety, I guess, I'd say of the insurance plan. So I think it's a combination of product offering, technology, service and strength of the company behind it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Marcon (Analysts)】\nGreat. And so when we -- with the supplemental schedule that you provided, when we take a look at the fourth quarter number for HRS, is -- do we have a full comp in, in terms of the insurance so that the fourth quarter is kind of indicative of the longer-term growth rate to expect out of HRS?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nOkay. You were good. You had me until the last statement. So I can't give you next year's guidance, but Q4 certainly is indicative of a full compare. I would hesitate, Mark, to say that simply because we're having -- we've been having a very strong year in PEO. When we do our plan, we'll figure that out. I don't anticipate it'll be quite that strong.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Marcon (Analysts)】\nOkay. So -- but we do have the full compare. It's in terms of the insurance plans, but the factor to think about is that even though Q4 has that full compare, we're then going up against a really strong year. And so therefore, there should be some. So  let's say that we end up being 100, 200 basis points lower than that fourth quarter number, does that seem like a pretty good, long, sustainable...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nMark, so my answer uniformly is that we target around double digits for HRS, and year-to-year, that can vary a little bit, but that's kind of what we're trying to get to.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Marcon (Analysts)】\nGot it. And then you said something interesting on the core payroll side, which is that you're already starting to see some clients come back to you from some of the newer solutions. Can you give a little more color around that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes, I think what we've seen -- it's a small sample set, but what we've seen is the service model being probably the biggest impact. I think what's selling some of the new companies that have come out is user interface and technology might look good to them. The service model has not been as complete or as strong as I think as they expect. I think some clients see service as possibly a commodity as they're going in, and it doesn't turn out to be that way. When you think of the breadth and experience that Paychex has versus some of the start-ups and the rate that they're trying to grow, you're going to have service issues, and I think that's been the primary thing that's driven them back to us.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Marcon (Analysts)】\nGreat. And then on the new clients that you're getting, are they typically on the smaller end of your range or the higher end of your -- and I'm talking about that under 20 core side.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nIt'd be over the 20. It'd be more in that mid-market space. Anywhere 20 to 200, really.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Marcon (Analysts)】\nAll right. I wasn't referring to the ones that are coming back. I just meant in terms of the overall client growth that you mentioned, the 1% to 3%...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nMark, it's skewing smaller.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Marcon (Analysts)】\nYes. And what I meant was, is it -- relative to where it's been historically, is it skewing even smaller?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nI can't really answer that specific question, but it is, in general, smaller.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Lisa Ellis (Analysts)】\nIf I unpack the accounting impact, it looks like your underlying apples-to-apples margins are trending up. Is that accurate? And can you give some color around that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes, they trended up from Q1, Lisa, and I think I was asked earlier kind of where are we in the guidance range. We still think we're in a -- solidly in the middle. We'll see. We'll update it as we go through quarter-to-quarter.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Lisa Ellis (Analysts)】\nTerrific. And then just a follow-up on the competitive environment in the small business space. You gave a little bit of color earlier around Kashoo and Paychex Accounting Online as well as your sort of net win-backs that you're seeing from some of the new entrants. Can you specifically give some color around Intuit? They have been pretty aggressive in a lot of their earnings calls, talking about their traction in payroll. I'd be curious to see your view on that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes, we have not really seen losses to Intuit. In fact, we have seen, as we've dug deeper into some of the gains, we've been gaining some from Intuit on a net basis. So I -- we haven't seen a big impact there. I do think they go after a little bit different market. While people always think that they may be taking share from us, we don't see that. We do see they compete more with our SurePayroll brand and company. And SurePayroll is still doing pretty well, so they still have double-digit client growth and so forth. So I think they're still doing well, and we haven't seen a big impact from Intuit. So they may be getting it more from those who are manual and kind of moving to a software, which is what we see happening with SurePayroll.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Tien-Tsin Huang (Analysts)】\nJust -- I'll be quick. I know it's a long call. So just clarifying on the PEO front. I'm curious, have you changed your sales philosophy at all with respect to pushing or promoting PEO? It sounds like you have. I don't think you -- I believe you sell both PEO, ASO together. Has that changed?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nNo, not really. We do sell them together. I think I did mention, though, that we do think there is a growing opportunity for the PEO. And so we are going to look at -- we are adding some reps that are just PEO-centric, so just kind of dedicated to the PEO. But we're still -- the vast majority are still selling both products because we still think we've seen good opportunity in both of them.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Tien-Tsin Huang (Analysts)】\nOkay. So just the new folks that you're bringing in are dedicated PEO?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Tien-Tsin Huang (Analysts)】\nGot it. And then just on the -- another clarification. Forgive me if I missed this. Just on the HRS guidance in the slides where you show the third quarter, fourth quarter guidance, it looks like it changed a little bit. So what is that -- so just a math -- so it's just on the math kind of thing?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes, Tien-tsin, so what ended up happening when we issued the guidance for the beginning of the year, the attach rates on the health care influenced the range. That's really basically what's going on. So we looked at where we expect to be in the third and fourth quarter and just wanted to tighten the range so that the midpoint obviously is where we think we're going to end up. But that could vary because attach rates on health care can change quarter-to-quarter. It's really -- we're being punctilious.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matthew O'Neill (Analysts)】\nI was just curious, going back to the 1% to 3% client growth, how you guys are thinking about that. It sounds like you kind of answered it already in that the SurePayroll is still growing double-digit, just as far as the mix as the source?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nWe don't really break it down. I think we're seeing growth on both -- from both of us. They're a little bit faster. Remember, they're a much smaller base from where they're coming from. So we're seeing growth across -- kind of across the board, really.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matthew O'Neill (Analysts)】\nGot it. Okay. And just one last follow-up, if you don't mind. I was just thinking through the kind of profile of the clients that rollout of the Paychex business versus the new sort of class of clients that come in every year. Is that profile, in aggregate, different? Is there anything to think about a client that's leaving the business versus the new client that's coming in? It sounds like maybe a little bit on the average number of employees is turning down a little bit. But aside from that, is there any bigger differences to think about conceptually?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nNo, not really. I mean, we track to the last $0.01 of revenue we lose, the size of client, what products they have. And it really hasn't changed much.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nOkay. Thank you. We will close the call. If you're interested in replaying the webcast, it will be archived until around January 19. I thank you for taking the time to participate in our second quarter press release conference call. We're excited about year end, a great time for opportunity to show our clients what we bring them from a service perspective as they close their year, many of them, and certainly, a big time for us in the selling season. And we're excited about all the work that our Paychex employees are doing.\r\nWith that, we wish you all a very happy holiday season, and thank you for joining us.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nTake care.",

I'll start by stating that the discussions we are having include -- will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and that these statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC.\r\nTo begin with, our first quarter operating results for the quarter, as you saw, we -- our reported earnings came in at $1.12 a share, up 17% or $0.16 per share over last year's first quarter earnings of $0.96 a share. A few items of note in terms of looking at the comparison. Within gross margin, which was higher year-over-year in the first quarter by 22 basis points, we benefited from strong margins in our gasoline business, which I'll speak to more when I discuss our gross margin results. And we also had a $17 million pretax nonrecurring loss recovery. This latter $17 million amount represented about 6 basis points of margin improvement or about $0.03 to our per-share earnings.\r\nOn interest income and other, you note, was higher year-over-year in the first quarter by $17 million pretax or about $0.03 a share. This increase primarily related to several of our foreign operations using FX contracts to lock in U.S. dollar-denominated merchandise payables. Under GAAP, the mark-to-market gains or losses, in this case, of course, gains, are recorded on the interest income and other income statement line. I really look at this part of merchandising gross margin in the sense that our foreign operations buyers lock in exchange rates at prices -- at amounts which they're comfortable they'd be able to price their merchandise at.\r\nThird, FX. In the first quarter, as you probably are aware, the foreign currencies where we operate overall weakened versus the U.S. dollar, primarily in Canada and Japan, resulting in our foreign earnings in the first quarter, when converted into U.S. dollars, being lower by about $22 million pretax or $0.03 a share than those earnings would've been had FX exchange rates have been flat year-over-year.\r\nFourth item, stock expense. That was higher year-over-year in the first quarter by $38 million or $0.06 a share. As I mentioned before, we have over 4,000 of our assistant managers and above who received restricted stock units as a significant part of their annual compensation. These grants are made annually each October or in the first fiscal quarter. These are issued grants that typically invest over a 5-year period, which would accelerate investing when recipient reaches 25, 30 or 35 years of employment with the company. Our factors driving this increase include, of course, the appreciation in our stock price, additional levels of accelerated investing giving some employees long tenure with the company and large number of employees in the plan. I should note that last October, our issued grants were reduced by an average of 15%, that is the number of our issues granted to each recipient.\r\nFifth, IT modernization cost. As discussed in each of the past 8 or so fiscal quarters' earnings calls, our major IT modernization efforts will continue to negatively impact our SG&A expense percentages through '15 and into probably the first half of '16, especially as these new systems are placed into service and depreciation begins. In the first quarter, on an incremental year-over-year basis, these costs -- these incremental costs impacted SG&A by $12 million or an estimated 3 basis points or $0.02 a share.\r\nTurning to our first quarter sales. In terms of sales for the quarter, our 12-week reported comp sales figures for Q1 showed a 5% increase on a reported basis, 6% in the U.S. and 1% internationally. As indicated in our release, excluding gas price deflation and the impact of FX, the 6% U.S. would've been a 7%, the 1% international would also have been a 7%, and therefore, the 5% for the total company reported on a normalized basis would've been a 7%. And as reported last Thursday, our November sales results for the 4-week month ended November 30, our comp sales increased, excluding again the impact of FX and gas, were even a bit stronger than these 12-weeks figures, with total company comps on that normalized basis increase of 8%, which would include a 9% in the U.S. and a 7% international, x gas and FX.\r\nOther topics of interest are opening activities and plans. We opened 8 new locations during the first quarter, which ended November 23, 6 in the U.S, our seventh location in Australia and our second location in Leon, Mexico. During the first quarter, we also relocated 1 location in Wayne, New Jersey to an expanded location. Also during the quarter, we -- about 6 weeks prior, we had experienced a severe hurricane in and around our Cabo San Lucas, Mexico location, that has since been reopened.\r\nWe have no openings planned for Q2. For all of fiscal '15, however, we have a current plan of 31 new locations, 18 of which will be in the U.S., 3 each in Japan and Mexico, 2 each in Australia and Korea, and 1 each in Canada, U.K. and Taiwan. Also this morning, I will review with you our e-commerce activities, our membership trends, additional discretionary amount, gross margin and SG&A in the quarter and just a few other topics of interest.\r\nNow on to the discussion of our quarterly results. Again, sales -- total sales were up 7.4% to $26.3 billion. Again, on a comp basis, reported a 5%, x gas and FX, it would've been a 7%. For the quarter, our reported 5% comp was a combination of an average transaction size of just over flat for the quarter, x gas and FX, it would've been up about 2.5%, and average frequency increase of about 4.5% in the quarter. In terms of comparisons by geographic region, geographically for the quarter, the Midwest and Southeast were the strongest, with Northeast close behind. Internationally and local currencies, the better-performing countries were Canada, Taiwan and Mexico. In terms of merchandise categories for the quarter, for the first quarter, within food and sundries, which was up in mid-single digits, candy, deli and spirits were up with relative standouts. Within hardlines, they were also up in the mid-single digits for the quarter. Majors are electronics, came in positive in the quarter, actually in the high single digits range. And in addition, better performing departments within hardlines was hardware, sporting goods and tires. Within mid-single digits, softline, domestics, apparel and home furnishings were the standouts. And fresh foods, where our comps are in the high singles, with meat department being the standout there.\r\nMoving to the line items in the income statement. In the first quarter, membership fees were up 6% or $33 million to $582 million, that was about -- given the sales strength, that was about 3 basis points decline. Again, x FX, that 6% dollar increase, assuming flat year-over-year FX, would have been up 8%. In terms of membership, we continue to benefit from strong sign-ups at existing and new warehouses, continued increasing penetration of the executive member and strong renewal rates, both in the U.S. and Canada as well as worldwide, newer markets. \r\nOur new membership sign-ups in Q1 year-over-year company-wide were up 4% year-over-year in the quarter, even though there were fewer locations opened, we opened 9 locations in Q1 this year versus 13 last year. That, of course, includes all member sign-ups, new member sign-ups, throughout the company. In terms of new number of members at Q1 end, we began the fiscal year -- ended last fiscal year with 31.6 million Gold Star members. We now have at this quarter end 32.1 million, so up about 0.5 million. Primary Business remained at 6.9 million, add-on business remained at 3.5 million. So all told, we went from 42 million member households to 42.5 million. And including additional card-- cardholders went from 76.4 million at fiscal year-end to 77.5 million at the end of the first quarter. \r\nAlso at Q1 end, Paid Executive memberships totaled 15.2 million, which was an increase during the 12 weeks of about 420,000 or about 35,000 a week increase in the quarter. Executive members, as you know, represent more than 1/3 of our membership base and over 2/3 of our sales and operation.\r\nIn terms of renewal rates, they continue strong. At the end of the fourth quarter, business memberships renewed at 94.4%. At Q1 '15, so 12 weeks later, at 94.5%, so up a tick. Gold Star remained at 89.8%. Total, 90.6% at fiscal year-end and 90.7% at Q1 end. And when I say total, that's U.S. and Canada, recognizing newer markets start-out at lower rates and build over the first several years. Worldwide, we remained at 87.3% in the fourth quarter and at Q1 end. Still a nice increase from the year earlier at the end of the first quarter last year at 87.3% and we ended the quarter with now was at 86.5% worldwide.\r\nAs I touched on last quarter's conference call, we continue to try new things to drive sales and members-- membership sign-ups. I did mention in this fiscal quarter, but on the last call, in early September, for 8 days we ran a nationwide promotion for new members on LivingSocial. It was a good value and we felt it worked pretty well, but we'll continue to look and see what we want to do going forward. No plans at this point.\r\nGoing on to the gross margin line. Gross margins, as you saw, were quite strong, up 22 basis points to 11.03%. Again, I'll ask you to jot down a few numbers. We'll have 4 columns. The first 2 columns are for the entire fiscal year '14, both reported and without gas deflation. And then, first quarter '15 would be columns 3 and 4, reported and without gas deflation.\r\nMoving across those lines -- those columns, core merchandise for the year was up 6 basis points on a reported basis and up 3, x gas deflation. For the quarter, it was down 6 basis points and down 13 without gas deflation. Ancillary, plus 6 and plus 6 in columns 1 and 2 for all of last fiscal year. In Q1 '15 reported, plus 22; and without gas deflation, plus 20. 2% reward, minus 1s across the 4 columns. LIFO, year-over-year and for the -- for all of last fiscal year was a minus 5 and a minus 5. We actually had a very small LIFO credit this year versus a very small LIFO charge last year in the quarter, so it's a plus 1 and a plus 1. Lastly, other adjustments, minus 2 and minus 2 in all of fiscal '14, and plus 6 and plus 7 without gas deflation for Q1. That's that onetime -- the nonrecurring loss that I mentioned earlier. So total reported was up 22, and for the quarter, and up 14 without gas deflation. Now the core merchandise I mentioned is -- again, on a reported basis, was down 6, and down 13, x gas. A lot of that again is driven by this-- particularly this [indiscernible] gas business, both in volume as well as margin contribution when gas margins were up when gas prices are going down, typically.\r\nCore gross margins, as a percent of their own sales, were slightly negative, a couple of basis points down year-over-year, with food and sundries and softlines showing year-over-year improvement. And hardlines and fresh foods gross margins being lower year-over-year in the quarter. Pretty much as what we planned -- what we continue to see in the fresh foods area, with some of the raw material cost going up.\r\nAncillary and other business gross margins, as I mentioned, was up 22, or up 20 without gas deflation. With the exception of pharma, slightly lower year-over-year pharmacy margins, most of the other ancillary business is starting with gasoline, of course, but optical, hearing aid, travel, business centers, all showed higher margins year-over-year in the quarter. 2% reward again, increasing penetration, represented 1 basis point hit to margin. And as I mentioned, LIFO was a 1 basis point swing. We had $1 million LIFO charge last year in the quarter and a small LIFO credit of about $2 million this year.\r\nMoving into SG&A. Our SG&A percentage year-over-year in the quarter was higher by 5 -- by 4 basis points, coming in at a 10 26 this year compared to a 10 22 last year in the quarter. Again, we'll do the same 4 columns for all of fiscal '14, both reported and without gas deflation, columns 3 and 4, first quarter, both reported and without gas deflation. Going across these line items, operations were a minus 2 and a plus 1 for the year and a plus 8 and a plus 16 for the quarter. Remember, pluses means lower year-over-year SG&A. Central, minus 3 and minus 3 in the year and minus 1 and minus 1 in the quarter. Stock compensation, minus 2 and minus 2 for the year and minus 11 and minus 11 for the quarter. And total would be against the reported for all of fiscal '14 SG&A was higher year-over-year by 7 basis points, without gas deflation, higher by 4. This year, in the first quarter, it was higher by 4 reported and better or lower by 4 without gas deflation. \r\nAnd a little elaboration on this. Core operations SG&A again was lower by 8, but lower by 16, x gas impact. Within operations and without gas, our payroll SG&A percentage was 9 basis points better year-over-year, a particularly good showing and certainly a reflection of a strong sales as well as strong gas sales, which have lower SG&A, while benefits or workers comp-related expenses were about 4 basis points worse year-over-year. Central expense was slightly higher year-over-year in the quarter by 1 basis point. Increased IT spending as we continue to monetize, as I mentioned, within this number, that was about 3 minus -- minus 3 basis points, and that will continue in those types of increments, we think. The decrease was partially offset, of course, by improved payroll in central as well as by 2 basis points.\r\nFinally, SG&A expense related to stock compensation was higher year-over-year by 11. I should point out that the year-over-year basis points variance for this expense item will be quite a bit less in Q2 and 3 and higher year-over-year in Q4, but not as big in negative variance as we've seen in Q1. Again, if you think about it, with most of the RSUs vesting over 5 years, you take out the one that finally vested so you take out the expense back when the stock was in the 50s, and you add 1 when the stock was in the 1 25, 1 30s when we did the one in October this year. \r\nAll told -- hold on, here, last thing on the income statement preopening expense, $24 million last year. It was lower or better improvement by 15 -- by $9 million, so $15 million this year. Again, we opened 9 units this year compared to 13 last year. So all told, reported operating income for the quarter totaled $668 million last year and $770 million this year or an increase of 15% or up $102 million for the quarter.\r\nBelow the operating income line, reported interest expense was about the same year-over-year, with Q1 '15 coming in at $26 million versus $27 million last year in the quarter.\r\nInterest income and others, I mentioned earlier, was quite a bit higher year-over-year, $18 million last year versus $35 million this year, up $17 million. Actual interest income component for the quarter was slightly up. I think, it was a little less than $1 million. The other component of equity earnings within this line item was higher by 16. This, again, relates to this marking to market gains on FX contracts used to source U.S. merchandise at our U.S. -- principally our U.S. merchandise and our international operations.\r\nOverall pretax income was up 18% versus last year's first quarter from 6 59 last year to 7 79 this year. In terms of tax rates, our effective tax rate this quarter came in a little higher than last year. It came in at 35.2% compared to last year's first quarter rate of 34.6%. The increase was mostly due to a few net discrete items that benefited last year by about $5 million and a couple of negative discrete items, which totaled about a hit to -- an increase in taxes of about $1 million this year. Overall net income was up 17% versus last year's first quarter from $425 million last year to $496 million this year.\r\nQuick rundown on a couple of other topics, balance sheet. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter came in at $254 million. In terms of accounts payable as a percent of inventories, you have the balance sheet attached to the press release. Now on that, it showed a reported number this year of 101% payables to inventories, up about 2 percentage points from 99% last year, that of course includes construction payables and other payables, not just merchandise. If you took out everything and just add merchandise payables as a percent of inventory, last year Q1 end, it was 89%, up 3 percentage points to 92% this year. Again, I think, a reflection of good inventory control, but also strong sales. \r\nAverage inventory per warehouse, last year, in the first quarter, ended at $14,453,000. This year, it came in slightly lower at $14,372,000, about $81,000 lower. If you take out FX, FX was about a minus $250,000 to that number. So if you take out FX, we were actually up, average inventory per warehouse, of about $169 million. Still a very small increase of 1.2% on that normalized basis compared to the 7-plus-percent sales increase.\r\nNo real issues with inventory levels going into the last few weeks of our calendar yearend, Christmas and the holidays. They're in good shape. \r\nIn the past couple of months, we have received questions about possible inventory issues due to the work slowdowns and shipping along the West Coast. I'm sure, like many retailers, we did what we could do to bring in seasonal merchandise a little early as required and necessary. Overall, it was not a big issue for November and December, and is not currently a big issue. Looking ahead into January and February, it's really not a big issue, perhaps even a small issue from seasonal furniture and some other types of items like that. Been talking to the merchants, not big delays, but a little bit of a backup.\r\nIn terms of CapEx, first quarter '15, we spent $555 million. Our fiscal '15 CapEx is estimated to be in the $2.5-plus billion range, and this compares to last year's $2 billion, so up pretty significantly year-over-year with our ramp-up in expansion and all the complementary things that go along with that with depot expansion, and of course, the IT expenses that I just mentioned as well.\r\nIn terms of dividends, our quarterly dividend of $0.355 a share or $1.40 annualized, based on shares outstanding, is about $625 million annually. We did buy a little stock back in Q1, about $18 million at an average price of $126.43. And the first, I believe, 5 weeks of this quarter, we were under blackout from the prior year with -- until we were able to report first quarter. And so we didn't buy a heck of a lot during the quarter.\r\nCostco Online. We're now in 4 countries, U.S., Canada, U.K. and Mexico. For the quarter, sales and profit were up over the year. E-commerce sales were up 20%, up 19% on a comp basis, and up 21% excluding FX. It still represents about 3% of our total sales, just under 3%. We continue to -- really going back a couple of years ago when we re-platformed the site, we've gone through a couple of iterations of improving our mobile applications. As I think I mentioned earlier, we've combined some of our e-commerce merchandise efforts with our in-line efforts, we think that's been a big help us. We've added a few categories like apparel, health and beauty aids and a few extra Kirkland signature items. We've certainly improved timing of shipment by shipping what we ship directly instead of from the manufacturer from one depot to a few depots around the country. Our international markets, stay tuned, maybe one additional country by the fiscal year-end '15. Certainly, at least one by the end of calendar '15.\r\nIn terms of a few other things that we've talked about in the past, Google Shopping Expense -- Express, is now being offered in 6 markets in the U.S., Bay Area, which is now geographically expanded from its initial testing about 10 months ago. Los Angeles area, New York City, Manhattan, and more recently, in October, the test continued into 3 new cities, Chicago, D.C. and Boston. Again, it's too early to completely tell, but we're seeing some increased overall spend. And it's been a good partner to work with Google. We're continuing to increase our offerings in categories in these tests as well.\r\nInstacart. It's now in 13 markets. This is where customers service cart order through Instacart. They come in and buy the merchandise and deliver to the customer. That's continuing to expand as well. And Boxed is now in 3 markets, I think, up from 2.\r\nLastly, I think, you saw a release, maybe we talked about it, with Alibaba T Mall in being shipped out of our Taiwan operations. We're shipping -- I think, we're up to about 125, 130 items, mostly various food or sundries or hardware-related items, about half of them are Kirkland Signature. It's great, but it's new, and we'll see where it goes from here. But certainly, getting our name known a little bit over there as well.\r\nIn terms of expansion, as I mentioned, we've got a lot going -- nothing going on in Q2. Just a few in Q3. We have 5 openings, although 2 of them are relocations, so net of 3. And we've got 20 planned for the 16-week fourth quarter. Most of those look pretty good at this point. It's just how the timing of them. In fiscal '14, for all of fiscal '14, which ended, of course, at the end of August, we added 29 units or about a 5% unit square footage growth. In '15, assuming we add the 30 to 31 units, on a base of 663, that would also be about a 5% square footage growth. If we get to the 31, it will be 18 in the U.S., 3 each in Japan and Mexico, 2 each in Australia and Korea, and 1 each in Canada, U.K. and Taiwan. So you ask for square footage numbers, at Q1 end, total square footage stood at 96,437,000 square feet.\r\nAnd with that, I'm going to turn it back over to Erika for any questions. Thank you.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nThank you, Erica. Good morning to everyone. This morning's press release reviews our first quarter fiscal 2015 operating results for the 12 weeks ended November 23. I'll start by stating that the discussions we are having include -- will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and that these statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC.\r\nTo begin with, our first quarter operating results for the quarter, as you saw, we -- our reported earnings came in at $1.12 a share, up 17% or $0.16 per share over last year's first quarter earnings of $0.96 a share.

In the first quarter, as you probably are aware, the foreign currencies where we operate overall weakened versus the U.S. dollar, primarily in Canada and Japan, resulting in our foreign earnings in the first quarter, when converted into U.S. dollars, being lower by about $22 million pretax or $0.03 a share than those earnings would've been had FX exchange rates have been flat year-over-year.\r\nFourth item, stock expense. That was higher year-over-year in the first quarter by $38 million or $0.06 a share. As I mentioned before, we have over 4,000 of our assistant managers and above who received restricted stock units as a significant part of their annual compensation. These grants are made annually each October or in the first fiscal quarter. These are issued grants that typically invest over a 5-year period, which would accelerate investing when recipient reaches 25, 30 or 35 years of employment with the company. Our factors driving this increase include, of course, the appreciation in our stock price, additional levels of accelerated investing giving some employees long tenure with the company and large number of employees in the plan. I should note that last October, our issued grants were reduced by an average of 15%, that is the number of our issues granted to each recipient.\r\nFifth, IT modernization cost. As discussed in each of the past 8 or so fiscal quarters' earnings calls, our major IT modernization efforts will continue to negatively impact our SG&A expense percentages through '15 and into probably the first half of '16, especially as these new systems are placed into service and depreciation begins. In the first quarter, on an incremental year-over-year basis, these costs -- these incremental costs impacted SG&A by $12 million or an estimated 3 basis points or $0.02 a share.\r\nTurning to our first quarter sales. In terms of sales for the quarter, our 12-week reported comp sales figures for Q1 showed a 5% increase on a reported basis, 6% in the U.S. and 1% internationally. As indicated in our release, excluding gas price deflation and the impact of FX, the 6% U.S. would've been a 7%, the 1% international would also have been a 7%, and therefore, the 5% for the total company reported on a normalized basis would've been a 7%. And as reported last Thursday, our November sales results for the 4-week month ended November 30, our comp sales increased, excluding again the impact of FX and gas, were even a bit stronger than these 12-weeks figures, with total company comps on that normalized basis increase of 8%, which would include a 9% in the U.S. and a 7% international, x gas and FX.\r\nOther topics of interest are opening activities and plans. We opened 8 new locations during the first quarter, which ended November 23, 6 in the U.S, our seventh location in Australia and our second location in Leon, Mexico. During the first quarter, we also relocated 1 location in Wayne, New Jersey to an expanded location. Also during the quarter, we -- about 6 weeks prior, we had experienced a severe hurricane in and around our Cabo San Lucas, Mexico location, that has since been reopened.\r\nWe have no openings planned for Q2. For all of fiscal '15, however, we have a current plan of 31 new locations, 18 of which will be in the U.S., 3 each in Japan and Mexico, 2 each in Australia and Korea, and 1 each in Canada, U.K. and Taiwan. Also this morning, I will review with you our e-commerce activities, our membership trends, additional discretionary amount, gross margin and SG&A in the quarter and just a few other topics of interest.\r\nNow on to the discussion of our quarterly results. Again, sales -- total sales were up 7.4% to $26.3 billion. Again, on a comp basis, reported a 5%, x gas and FX, it would've been a 7%. For the quarter, our reported 5% comp was a combination of an average transaction size of just over flat for the quarter, x gas and FX, it would've been up about 2.5%, and average frequency increase of about 4.5% in the quarter. In terms of comparisons by geographic region, geographically for the quarter, the Midwest and Southeast were the strongest, with Northeast close behind. Internationally and local currencies, the better-performing countries were Canada, Taiwan and Mexico. In terms of merchandise categories for the quarter, for the first quarter, within food and sundries, which was up in mid-single digits, candy, deli and spirits were up with relative standouts. Within hardlines, they were also up in the mid-single digits for the quarter. Majors are electronics, came in positive in the quarter, actually in the high single digits range. And in addition, better performing departments within hardlines was hardware, sporting goods and tires. Within mid-single digits, softline, domestics, apparel and home furnishings were the standouts. And fresh foods, where our comps are in the high singles, with meat department being the standout there.\r\nMoving to the line items in the income statement. In the first quarter, membership fees were up 6% or $33 million to $582 million, that was about -- given the sales strength, that was about 3 basis points decline. Again, x FX, that 6% dollar increase, assuming flat year-over-year FX, would have been up 8%. In terms of membership, we continue to benefit from strong sign-ups at existing and new warehouses, continued increasing penetration of the executive member and strong renewal rates, both in the U.S. and Canada as well as worldwide, newer markets. \r\nOur new membership sign-ups in Q1 year-over-year company-wide were up 4% year-over-year in the quarter, even though there were fewer locations opened, we opened 9 locations in Q1 this year versus 13 last year. That, of course, includes all member sign-ups, new member sign-ups, throughout the company. In terms of new number of members at Q1 end, we began the fiscal year -- ended last fiscal year with 31.6 million Gold Star members. We now have at this quarter end 32.1 million, so up about 0.5 million. Primary Business remained at 6.9 million, add-on business remained at 3.5 million. So all told, we went from 42 million member households to 42.5 million. And including additional card-- cardholders went from 76.4 million at fiscal year-end to 77.5 million at the end of the first quarter. \r\nAlso at Q1 end, Paid Executive memberships totaled 15.2 million, which was an increase during the 12 weeks of about 420,000 or about 35,000 a week increase in the quarter. Executive members, as you know, represent more than 1/3 of our membership base and over 2/3 of our sales and operation.\r\nIn terms of renewal rates, they continue strong. At the end of the fourth quarter, business memberships renewed at 94.4%. At Q1 '15, so 12 weeks later, at 94.5%, so up a tick. Gold Star remained at 89.8%. Total, 90.6% at fiscal year-end and 90.7% at Q1 end. And when I say total, that's U.S. and Canada, recognizing newer markets start-out at lower rates and build over the first several years. Worldwide, we remained at 87.3% in the fourth quarter and at Q1 end. Still a nice increase from the year earlier at the end of the first quarter last year at 87.3% and we ended the quarter with now was at 86.5% worldwide.\r\nAs I touched on last quarter's conference call, we continue to try new things to drive sales and members-- membership sign-ups. I did mention in this fiscal quarter, but on the last call, in early September, for 8 days we ran a nationwide promotion for new members on LivingSocial. It was a good value and we felt it worked pretty well, but we'll continue to look and see what we want to do going forward. No plans at this point.\r\nGoing on to the gross margin line. Gross margins, as you saw, were quite strong, up 22 basis points to 11.03%. Again, I'll ask you to jot down a few numbers. We'll have 4 columns. The first 2 columns are for the entire fiscal year '14, both reported and without gas deflation. And then, first quarter '15 would be columns 3 and 4, reported and without gas deflation.\r\nMoving across those lines -- those columns, core merchandise for the year was up 6 basis points on a reported basis and up 3, x gas deflation. For the quarter, it was down 6 basis points and down 13 without gas deflation. Ancillary, plus 6 and plus 6 in columns 1 and 2 for all of last fiscal year. In Q1 '15 reported, plus 22; and without gas deflation, plus 20. 2% reward, minus 1s across the 4 columns. LIFO, year-over-year and for the -- for all of last fiscal year was a minus 5 and a minus 5. We actually had a very small LIFO credit this year versus a very small LIFO charge last year in the quarter, so it's a plus 1 and a plus 1. Lastly, other adjustments, minus 2 and minus 2 in all of fiscal '14, and plus 6 and plus 7 without gas deflation for Q1. That's that onetime -- the nonrecurring loss that I mentioned earlier. So total reported was up 22, and for the quarter, and up 14 without gas deflation. Now the core merchandise I mentioned is -- again, on a reported basis, was down 6, and down 13, x gas. A lot of that again is driven by this-- particularly this [indiscernible] gas business, both in volume as well as margin contribution when gas margins were up when gas prices are going down, typically.\r\nCore gross margins, as a percent of their own sales, were slightly negative, a couple of basis points down year-over-year, with food and sundries and softlines showing year-over-year improvement. And hardlines and fresh foods gross margins being lower year-over-year in the quarter. Pretty much as what we planned -- what we continue to see in the fresh foods area, with some of the raw material cost going up.\r\nAncillary and other business gross margins, as I mentioned, was up 22, or up 20 without gas deflation. With the exception of pharma, slightly lower year-over-year pharmacy margins, most of the other ancillary business is starting with gasoline, of course, but optical, hearing aid, travel, business centers, all showed higher margins year-over-year in the quarter. 2% reward again, increasing penetration, represented 1 basis point hit to margin. And as I mentioned, LIFO was a 1 basis point swing. We had $1 million LIFO charge last year in the quarter and a small LIFO credit of about $2 million this year.\r\nMoving into SG&A. Our SG&A percentage year-over-year in the quarter was higher by 5 -- by 4 basis points, coming in at a 10 26 this year compared to a 10 22 last year in the quarter. Again, we'll do the same 4 columns for all of fiscal '14, both reported and without gas deflation, columns 3 and 4, first quarter, both reported and without gas deflation. Going across these line items, operations were a minus 2 and a plus 1 for the year and a plus 8 and a plus 16 for the quarter. Remember, pluses means lower year-over-year SG&A. Central, minus 3 and minus 3 in the year and minus 1 and minus 1 in the quarter. Stock compensation, minus 2 and minus 2 for the year and minus 11 and minus 11 for the quarter. And total would be against the reported for all of fiscal '14 SG&A was higher year-over-year by 7 basis points, without gas deflation, higher by 4. This year, in the first quarter, it was higher by 4 reported and better or lower by 4 without gas deflation. \r\nAnd a little elaboration on this. Core operations SG&A again was lower by 8, but lower by 16, x gas impact. Within operations and without gas, our payroll SG&A percentage was 9 basis points better year-over-year, a particularly good showing and certainly a reflection of a strong sales as well as strong gas sales, which have lower SG&A, while benefits or workers comp-related expenses were about 4 basis points worse year-over-year. Central expense was slightly higher year-over-year in the quarter by 1 basis point. Increased IT spending as we continue to monetize, as I mentioned, within this number, that was about 3 minus -- minus 3 basis points, and that will continue in those types of increments, we think. The decrease was partially offset, of course, by improved payroll in central as well as by 2 basis points.\r\nFinally, SG&A expense related to stock compensation was higher year-over-year by 11. I should point out that the year-over-year basis points variance for this expense item will be quite a bit less in Q2 and 3 and higher year-over-year in Q4, but not as big in negative variance as we've seen in Q1. Again, if you think about it, with most of the RSUs vesting over 5 years, you take out the one that finally vested so you take out the expense back when the stock was in the 50s, and you add 1 when the stock was in the 1 25, 1 30s when we did the one in October this year. \r\nAll told -- hold on, here, last thing on the income statement preopening expense, $24 million last year. It was lower or better improvement by 15 -- by $9 million, so $15 million this year. Again, we opened 9 units this year compared to 13 last year. So all told, reported operating income for the quarter totaled $668 million last year and $770 million this year or an increase of 15% or up $102 million for the quarter.\r\nBelow the operating income line, reported interest expense was about the same year-over-year, with Q1 '15 coming in at $26 million versus $27 million last year in the quarter.\r\nInterest income and others, I mentioned earlier, was quite a bit higher year-over-year, $18 million last year versus $35 million this year, up $17 million. Actual interest income component for the quarter was slightly up. I think, it was a little less than $1 million. The other component of equity earnings within this line item was higher by 16. This, again, relates to this marking to market gains on FX contracts used to source U.S. merchandise at our U.S. -- principally our U.S. merchandise and our international operations.\r\nOverall pretax income was up 18% versus last year's first quarter from 6 59 last year to 7 79 this year. In terms of tax rates, our effective tax rate this quarter came in a little higher than last year. It came in at 35.2% compared to last year's first quarter rate of 34.6%. The increase was mostly due to a few net discrete items that benefited last year by about $5 million and a couple of negative discrete items, which totaled about a hit to -- an increase in taxes of about $1 million this year. Overall net income was up 17% versus last year's first quarter from $425 million last year to $496 million this year.\r\nQuick rundown on a couple of other topics, balance sheet. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter came in at $254 million. In terms of accounts payable as a percent of inventories, you have the balance sheet attached to the press release. Now on that, it showed a reported number this year of 101% payables to inventories, up about 2 percentage points from 99% last year, that of course includes construction payables and other payables, not just merchandise. If you took out everything and just add merchandise payables as a percent of inventory, last year Q1 end, it was 89%, up 3 percentage points to 92% this year. Again, I think, a reflection of good inventory control, but also strong sales. \r\nAverage inventory per warehouse, last year, in the first quarter, ended at $14,453,000. This year, it came in slightly lower at $14,372,000, about $81,000 lower. If you take out FX, FX was about a minus $250,000 to that number. So if you take out FX, we were actually up, average inventory per warehouse, of about $169 million. Still a very small increase of 1.2% on that normalized basis compared to the 7-plus-percent sales increase.\r\nNo real issues with inventory levels going into the last few weeks of our calendar yearend, Christmas and the holidays. They're in good shape. \r\nIn the past couple of months, we have received questions about possible inventory issues due to the work slowdowns and shipping along the West Coast. I'm sure, like many retailers, we did what we could do to bring in seasonal merchandise a little early as required and necessary. Overall, it was not a big issue for November and December, and is not currently a big issue. Looking ahead into January and February, it's really not a big issue, perhaps even a small issue from seasonal furniture and some other types of items like that. Been talking to the merchants, not big delays, but a little bit of a backup.\r\nIn terms of CapEx, first quarter '15, we spent $555 million. Our fiscal '15 CapEx is estimated to be in the $2.5-plus billion range, and this compares to last year's $2 billion, so up pretty significantly year-over-year with our ramp-up in expansion and all the complementary things that go along with that with depot expansion, and of course, the IT expenses that I just mentioned as well.\r\nIn terms of dividends, our quarterly dividend of $0.355 a share or $1.40 annualized, based on shares outstanding, is about $625 million annually. We did buy a little stock back in Q1, about $18 million at an average price of $126.43. And the first, I believe, 5 weeks of this quarter, we were under blackout from the prior year with -- until we were able to report first quarter. And so we didn't buy a heck of a lot during the quarter.\r\nCostco Online. We're now in 4 countries, U.S., Canada, U.K. and Mexico. For the quarter, sales and profit were up over the year. E-commerce sales were up 20%, up 19% on a comp basis, and up 21% excluding FX. It still represents about 3% of our total sales, just under 3%. We continue to -- really going back a couple of years ago when we re-platformed the site, we've gone through a couple of iterations of improving our mobile applications. As I think I mentioned earlier, we've combined some of our e-commerce merchandise efforts with our in-line efforts, we think that's been a big help us. We've added a few categories like apparel, health and beauty aids and a few extra Kirkland signature items. We've certainly improved timing of shipment by shipping what we ship directly instead of from the manufacturer from one depot to a few depots around the country. Our international markets, stay tuned, maybe one additional country by the fiscal year-end '15. Certainly, at least one by the end of calendar '15.\r\nIn terms of a few other things that we've talked about in the past, Google Shopping Expense -- Express, is now being offered in 6 markets in the U.S., Bay Area, which is now geographically expanded from its initial testing about 10 months ago. Los Angeles area, New York City, Manhattan, and more recently, in October, the test continued into 3 new cities, Chicago, D.C. and Boston. Again, it's too early to completely tell, but we're seeing some increased overall spend. And it's been a good partner to work with Google. We're continuing to increase our offerings in categories in these tests as well.\r\nInstacart. It's now in 13 markets. This is where customers service cart order through Instacart. They come in and buy the merchandise and deliver to the customer. That's continuing to expand as well. And Boxed is now in 3 markets, I think, up from 2.\r\nLastly, I think, you saw a release, maybe we talked about it, with Alibaba T Mall in being shipped out of our Taiwan operations. We're shipping -- I think, we're up to about 125, 130 items, mostly various food or sundries or hardware-related items, about half of them are Kirkland Signature. It's great, but it's new, and we'll see where it goes from here. But certainly, getting our name known a little bit over there as well.\r\nIn terms of expansion, as I mentioned, we've got a lot going -- nothing going on in Q2. Just a few in Q3. We have 5 openings, although 2 of them are relocations, so net of 3. And we've got 20 planned for the 16-week fourth quarter. Most of those look pretty good at this point. It's just how the timing of them. In fiscal '14, for all of fiscal '14, which ended, of course, at the end of August, we added 29 units or about a 5% unit square footage growth. In '15, assuming we add the 30 to 31 units, on a base of 663, that would also be about a 5% square footage growth. If we get to the 31, it will be 18 in the U.S., 3 each in Japan and Mexico, 2 each in Australia and Korea, and 1 each in Canada, U.K. and Taiwan. So you ask for square footage numbers, at Q1 end, total square footage stood at 96,437,000 square feet.\r\nAnd with that, I'm going to turn it back over to Erika for any questions. Thank you.",
      "transcript_text3": "So Rich, I wanted to drill a little bit on gross by category. So 2 were up, 2 were down. The 2 that were down, so fresh food and hardline. Was-- fresh food was solely pass-through of inflation? And was hardline's entirely mix?\n\n---\n\nFresh foods was certainly inflation and us holding prices, like you know we do. Things I know -- again, soundbite, anecdotal, butter and milk is way up, and so which is, therefore, cheese, and so you've got those types of items. On the other side, some of it is electronics, that's more competitive and we're part of that. And so a little of it is mix. But nothing really -- in our view, nothing really out of the ordinary.\n\n---\n\nAnd then, when you look at the 2 that were up, and I take it they were not up a lot, is that solely mix? And where is Kirkland -- I guess, Kirkland would have a big impact in food and sundries, that's where it would show up. Is that primarily driving the better mix?\n\n---\n\nHonestly, I don't have that level of detail in front of me. I'm looking -- first of all, none of the ups or downs were -- they were in the 10 to 25 basis point range basically, up or down. So not a lot of jumping either way. So my guess is a little of it is mix. KS helps. But clearly, KS, the big penetration increase of KS from 0% to 25% over the last high teens or 20 years, those increments are smaller now. And so yes, it helps, but it doesn't help like the days when you're adding a percentage point or 2 in a year sometimes.\n\n---\n\nAll right. And then, lastly, you talked about FX and inventory. Even putting that aside, obviously, inventory is under hopefully good control. Is that -- is more of that in-store? Or is more of that sort of backstage building your inventory in the stores?\n\n---\n\nKeep in mind, if we're turning our inventories 12-plus times a year, everything's pretty fast-paced. When -- if you are in Canada or Japan or wherever, and you're buying -- buyers using FX contracts because they've got -- in most cases, it's U.S.-dollar-denominated inventory payables, they're going to lock in based on what they've got coming in and when they know when they're going to have to pay in dollars at a time when they're comfortable with -- based on that conversion rate, they're comfortable with the price point they're going to sell in their local currency in that local country. So it's pretty straightforward. In fairness, as you know, it's -- some quarters year-over-year, some quarters, it's a $10 million gain, sometimes, it's a $10 million loss. This time, it was a little better. I think, partly a reflection of the weakness and the strength of the dollar and how quickly that the strength in -- particularly in a couple of countries.\n\n---\n\nSo nothing you're doing structurally to take inventory working capital out of the system?\n\n---\n\nNo. I mean, we do that all -- I mean, that's just kind of one of the mantras that we try to do anyway. Mind you, I mean, this is an example from, gosh, 20 years ago when the tobacco business, which is a very high volume, not as high volume as it used to be, but a very high-volume business and a very fast-turning business. I remember years ago, the big -- the majors offered, let's say, whatever the terms were, x percent discount if paid within 7 days. And then, they came back and said, \"We'll give you an extra 0.5 point if you pay 1 day EFT or ACH or whatever it was.\" So 0.5% for paying 6 days early. Well, it's a no-brainer. But you take a high-volume item like that, and it goes from a lot of -- probably 100% payable to 0, almost. So I mean, that's an extreme example. You've got gas working the other way where accounts payable is probably 600% or 700%.\n\n---\n\nThis is Joshua Siber on for Simeon Gutman. Just curious, looking back, how are customers reacting to lower gasoline prices? And have you seen any trade-up from regular to premium?\n\n---\n\nI don't know. I think, we sold more premium anyway, but I don't know that off the top of my head. I think, the reflection that our shopping frequency and our comps continue to be strong is probably a reflection of that. Our view historically has been on something big like this, whether it was when gas was going crazy upward towards $4 a gallon in middle -- in early to mid-'08. Did it impact us? It probably impacts a little bit, but not as much as some of the dollar-type stores or lower demographic stores. We -- similarly, are we getting a little benefit from it? Yes, but we don't think it's big either way for us.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Just looking forward...\n\n---\n\nIt's going to help...\n\n---\n\nSorry. What was that?\n\n---\n\nIt's got to help a little.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then, looking forward, if gasoline stays where it's at right now, is there a change in profitability? Or have we seen the most of it in Q1?\n\n---\n\nWell, I'll tell you what that I know. I mean, it's a volatile business, as we know. Generally speaking, when it's declining, it's the best in terms of profitability. It is more profitable at any level that it used to be a little bit. I think, part of that -- and again, we -- it's a profitable business. It's a lower percent of sales profitability than the company as a whole. I think, one thing that's encouraging for us, though, is more and more people come and get their gas. For those that come in -- for every 100 people that shop -- that pump gas during opening hours, a little over 50 of them now come in and shop. And so even if 1 or 2 of those 50 are incremental, that's a positive. We've been helped 2 years in a row now with these outside entities like gasbuddy.com, where nationwide, on average, we're the lowest priced. That's helped. I know our gallon comps in the first quarter were low single digits, which is really off the charts in terms of getting people into our parking lot, and that's good.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And if you don't mind, if I could add just one more. If you could discuss, has there been a mentality or strategic shift on the e-commerce front, if you feel you've gotten more aggressive over the past 6 to 12 months?\n\n---\n\nI think, the things that I mentioned has probably been over the past 6 to 18 or 24 months, but certainly, we've added a few SKUs, expanded some categories, trying to get people to think of it not just as the place that I can buy patio furniture or a big TV, but also some regular, higher-velocity items. And yes, so nothing, I think, it's been more -- if you look -- if I just look at year-over-year sales increases on a comp basis, it wasn't -- about a couple of years ago, it was kind of in the a mid-single -- stuck in the mid-single-digits. And last year, it was in the high-teens, and this quarter, it continues in that very high-teen, low 20 area. So yes, I think, that's a reflection of the things that we've done, but nothing new and dramatic in the last 6 months. It's a continuation of that.\n\n---\n\nJust to clarify on the gross margin grid, did you say that x gas, the core was down 13 basis points?\n\n---\n\nThe core is down, but again, it's almost like -- under the phrase, no good deed goes unpunished, over the years, as I've tried to explain this in a little matrix, you almost need a three-dimensional matrix. Given the gas was strong and gas gross margins were very strong relative to the very low gross margin business, that disproportionately weights those 2 lines in that little matrix such that -- and that's why I pointed it out that if you look at just food and sundries, hardlines, softlines and fresh foods, those 4 core areas, which, gosh, I better -- 80-plus-percent of our business, those were, year-over-year, were down 2 basis points, 2 of those subdepartments up 10 to 25 basis points, 2 of them down 10 to 25 basis points. So the core business is pretty much flat year-over-year. But it shows on that chart that way because of that high dollar penetration of gas.\n\n---\n\nOkay. So the up 2 basis points would more or less compare to, say, the up 6 or 7 basis points that you posted in the third and fourth quarter?\n\n---\n\nYes, but it was down 2 and not up.\n\n---\n\nI'm sorry, down 2. Okay. I get it. And then, on the CapEx guide, you had a big acceleration from this year versus last year, yet store growth is pretty consistent. Just wondering if you could speak to the delta. Is it IT spend? Is it land? Just what's driving the increase?\n\n---\n\nWell, it's also 4 more locations including relos. It is -- IT is probably at least 100 of it. International is more expensive. We probably are spending more this year on depot-type stuff. All -- I'm rounding here, but depots, I bet, year-over-year is 100, 150 higher. So probably -- but year-over-year and the prior year, there was probably 75 to 100 on IT, shooting from the hip here, but the big things are -- and certainly, for the year, that 2 5 to 2 6 number, we have an original budget probably a little higher than that. But we know that a couple of them will slip and some of that assumes land banking for the first part of the next year. But clearly, we are spending more on some of these international locations, in a confident way, frankly, I mean, some of the ones in Asia, as you know, are, knock on wood, so far, have been relatively no-brainers.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Just last question on the balance sheet, roughly $17 per share in cash. Any updated thoughts on getting a little bit more systematic on the buyback from doing so much each quarter or so much each year as opposed to setting up the grid? And any thoughts on the current dividend? 1% yield is a lot lower than some of your consumer staple peers.\n\n---\n\nOur board discusses this every quarterly board meeting. Again, I guess, I've learned that the matrix works when stocks move slowly either direction. We've had that high-quality problem that put a matrix in place, and then, in some cases, we're locked in for 5 or 6 weeks due to a blackout. And then, it moves well above several dollars of cushion we gave it. I think, we want to be more systematic, but I can't say when it will be. We'll talk to you next quarter. But certainly, given that we grant to these 4,200 or 4,300 employees annual grants that are just in the high 3s, 3.6 -- 3.8 million shares or something, we want to at least have that, I think, on an ongoing basis. And we certainly did not do that on a quarterly basis this quarter. But the year is still young and we'll see. We'll let you know next quarter. As it relates to the dividend, again, that's a conversation we continue to have and we look at all. And we recognize that our first priority is CapEx, and then, tied for second, if you will, are a few other things that we'll continue to look at. I'm sure we'll do some things over time, but they will be on a timetable that we feel comfortable with.\n\n---\n\nA couple of questions. First, on gross margins, too. If you look at that, you may have discussed it in your prepared remarks, and I apologize, but the ancillary gross margin benefit we saw in the beginning here in Q1, can you just discuss the drivers of that? And how should we think about going to sustainability of that over the next few quarters?\n\n---\n\nWell, I mean, the big kahuna was gas. I mean, as I mentioned, I think, 5 of 6, or 5 of 7, or 6 of 7 of our ancillary businesses all had up year-over-year gross margins, most particularly was gas. And so is that sustainable? No. It's never sustainable. You see where gas prices are now, so it's continuing, but again, that can be fleeting. And we've been asked the question, well, when you get these outsized profits, so you're more aggressive in pricing. We don't sit down and say, let's use this many dollars, but certainly, we're going to be aggressive and that's what we do for a living. So I think that buffers it a little bit as well.\n\n---\n\nSo it actually goes in my next question. I think, Richard you already answered it. But in a market -- if we look at Costco Gas right now, just more from a competitive standpoint, Costco Gas versus competitors, you typically price below, you're saying that in terms of prices doing what they've done, you essentially kept your competitive relationship the same, even in bearish markets?\n\n---\n\nWe've improved the competitive relationship, in our minds.\n\n---\n\nIt's Dan Binder. Just a follow-up on that gas discussion. With all the movement in the gallon comps and the pricing, where are we now as a percentage of sales for gas?\n\n---\n\nI'll have somebody calculate it right now for you. Hold on a second.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And my other question, if you want to focus on that first, is on consumer electronics, you've talked to a lot of strength there. Any color you can give us around sort of the breadth of that strength, where you're seeing it, what you're seeing with 4K TV and competitive pricing?\n\n---\n\nWell, first of all, as you know, we introduced several Apple products over the last year. That's a very competitive business for retailers and for us as well. We know that. But we want to have that product for our members. 4K TVs are going well. I believe that on those higher-end TVs, we tend to be the outlier in terms of driving sales of those. But it's still small relative to the entire category, that component. Phone business is very strong. You can see what we've done with our kiosks out there. And not only phone business has been strong, added to that, we've added the Apple brand there as well, and then in the various tablets. So there's a lot of different things in that area that are helping the sales strength. Again, I think, it tends to be a little more competitive, Apple is part of that, that's pretty much it. Nothing out of the ordinary. I mean, it's -- these things fluctuate up and down a little bit. We're pleased that these -- of the strength of the comps in that area. By the way, in terms of the question about gas penetration, for the quarter, it was about 10.5%.\n\n---\n\n10.5%. And just a quick question on the cannibalization rate. I know it hasn't really changed much. I think, it's like 50 basis points at any given month on the comp. I was just curious, can you give us an idea of what you're seeing on the bounce-back of those clubs once you cannibalize it? Does it come back to sort of historical volumes within a year, 2 years? Has that been changing at all as you've been doing more fill-ins?\n\n---\n\nGenerally, it's a year or maybe slightly over a year. I mean, generally, when we open -- when we cannibalize our own units, you might take anywhere as much as 10% or 15% from nearby unit or units. And 1 year, 1.5 years later, you're pretty much back, going forward, not looking back in the past year, of course. And again, it varies, but overall, it's been pretty predictable for us. Based on ZIP code analysis of where the members are shopping from, we generally know -- and what we find is -- the benefit really is, do we pick up a few extra members? Yes. Not a lot. Well, we pick up a lot of frequency. If you have a loyal member that's shopping, I'm making these numbers up, but once a month, because they're a 30-minute drive away from a Costco, and all of a sudden, they're 10-minute drive away, and it becomes a significantly more regular shopping frequency.\n\n---\n\nIt's Meredith Adler. I was wondering, I'm still somewhat new to the Costco story. If you could talk about where you see the most potential growth. Obviously, you don't have a lot of locations in Continental Europe, and yet it's tough to get open warehouses there. When you look at Asia, do you feel like you still got a lot more growth in those markets? And what about the U.S.?\n\n---\n\nWell, if you'd asked me 5 years ago where we would expect to be now, I would say our goal is to get up to about 30 locations a year by this time. And probably, we'd be right at that middle point of trending from the majority in the U.S. to less than half in the U.S. If you look at this year and next, it's 30 -- roughly 30 a year. Still a little over half in the U.S. I think 16 or so last year. And I think I mentioned 18 out of 31 this year. So -- and that's, by the way, a function that we've continued to be successful in lots of what I'll call newer markets, meaning the markets over the last 10 to 15 years. And while we'll still get another unit opened in the Puget Sound or perhaps in the Portland area one day or hopefully every year to get another L.A. unit in the Greater L.A. market of 45 or 50 units, but they are precision points now where, locations where we need to go. But we're finding in a lot of these cities, again whether it's Chicago, and Dallas and Atlanta, or smaller cities in Florida and the Carolinas or new markets like Baton Rouge and New Orleans last year. So that's probably up to our expectation a little bit about our opportunities here in the U.S. Outside of the U.S., we've got 10 or 11, I believe, in each of Korea and Taiwan, maybe 12. We think that we can go into the mid- to high-20s there over time. But again, they take some time to get done and where. Japan is certainly a bigger market for us. We've got 23, I believe, 22 or 23. We should have a lot more than that, but we went from 9 to 21 or something in 2, a little over 2 years. So we're doing well there, and we just, as I mentioned, opened our seventh in Australia. Well, Australia is, what, 2/3 the size population-wise as Canada, where we have 90 or so units, we have 7 in Australia. I'm not suggesting we're going to have 45 in Australia anytime soon. But certainly, we'll get more than 7. Western Europe or all of Europe is certainly an opportunity for us. It is tough to get in. Even in the worst of economies, yes, we've been successful with about 4 years of effort getting one unit opened in Spain, with the second coming towards the middle to the end of next calendar year. And we're still fighting to get our first unit opened in France. So it takes some time, but we're persistent and we'll be around.\n\n---\n\nClearly a different question on gas prices, and my historical recollection is that when gas prices were high, more consumers might go out of their way to drive to Costco, and that, that was viewed as a historical benefit to traffic. But the inverse does not appear to be happening. And so I'm wondering what, in your view, has changed? Or, I mean, do you think there is a risk if gas prices stay lower that you may not get quite as much a lift in terms of traffic to the stores as in the past?\n\n---\n\nI think when gas prices were skyrocketing back in '08, going up towards $4 for the first time, we were on the news every night somewhere, whether it's a small town in Montana or Los Angeles. And where is the best place to buy gas. And so that certainly was a positive. Theoretically, your argument is, is that people, as prices fall, that will be less of an incentive. I think it's a greater membership value proposition. I mean, when a gasbuddy.com comes out and says 40-plus-million inputs from customers -- from drivers out there, saying that we're the best lowest price nationally by $0.14 or $0.16, that resonates. The fresh foods, second to none in our view. We're biased. But that drives a lot of business. The pharmacy, frankly, the -- I think deserves credit we get for that in terms of pricing. So it's -- the fact that we -- we're proud of the fact that we take care of our employees. All those things are positives. I think once you've come to Costco for gas, and we got you into the warehouse, there's reasons why you want to come back. And I think we're starting to appreciate the fact that it's all of the above. It's some of the crazy KS items that -- or KS items, where you get to buy them at Costco. Well, there are few other places now you can buy them, but we're selling them to those people.\n\n---\n\nYour traffic just continues to amaze. My other question is on China. And so I understand it's very early with Alibaba. But I wanted to ask you, is there any change in your long-term thinking on China? You did say that there's a benefit of getting your name known there. I mean, historically, you've had some reservations, but are -- are you, should we be thinking that club growth is in the future there? And what might inform that?\n\n---\n\nI think it's in the future, but if you'd ask me that same question 10 years ago, I would say I think it's in the future. And not being cute about it, every couple of 3 years, senior management, both international senior management and corporate senior management goes over there and looks around. And we continue to do that. And we recognize it's a, look, it's a giant market. We're confident about what we do. We're also very hands-on. And we got a lot of things going on in a lot of directions. And we kind of know -- we know that, everybody says, well, somebody is getting there first. Well, people have gotten at other places first. And when we come in, we'll do just fine. So it will be at some point, I don't know when. If you said what's the likelihood in the next 5 to 10 years? Sure. Next 2 to 5 years? Maybe. Next Thursday? We're not ready yet.\n\n---\n\nSo I wanted to follow up on the acceleration in the core comps over the past year. It seems like most of the acceleration is seen in the hardlines category. So would you agree with that? Or has there been movements toward the high end of the ranges that you provide in softlines and fresh foods and so forth? And within CE, is that TV turning positive, plus the addition of Apple, driving the hardlines rebound?\n\n---\n\nWell, that's one of the things. I think, I mentioned that tires have been good this year. Automotive, Lawn & Garden have been good. And it's -- we're out of season for that now. Apparel has continued to be strong. I mean, we enjoyed a couple of years on a compounded basis, apparel comps, apparel increases in the mid- to high-teens. So that, of course, at some point has got to come down a little bit. But organics is helping. I think in the last 2 years, we've -- a little more than doubled organic sales from the low billions to closing in on $3 billion currently. And so that's -- all those things help.\n\n---\n\nSo -- but within the hardlines category, is it -- is that TV and Apple, essentially, that's driven that acceleration? Within that [indiscernible].\n\n---\n\nI would say TV and Apple are probably the top 2, without looking at the detail. Phones are probably in there, too. Phones could be first or second for -- I don't think phones are first, but phones, TV and the reintroduction of some of the Apple items.\n\n---\n\nAnd did -- when you didn't sell, let's say, iPads, were you selling iPhones in the wireless kiosks?\n\n---\n\nYes, we are. By the way, as a comment was made here in my office, those are the big volume categories. But white goods are up, not that we do a big white goods business. Audio is up, again, a smaller business, but we -- and it's not just headphones. It's sound systems and all kinds of stuff. But the big volume areas are those 3 that I mentioned.\n\n---\n\nAnd with Apple sort of a point in time add-back to the store base overall? Or did that start in, let's say, June and then ramp-up over the past 5 months?\n\n---\n\nI think that's right, but it's not -- it's a piece of it. It's not the driving piece.\n\n---\n\nUnderstood, understood. And then on depreciation, can you give us some color how to think about the depreciation? I know you don't -- I don't believe you historically guide to it, but with the incremental CapEx over the past couple of years, it would seem like dollars per week or dollars per quarter, that will continue to rise for, I think, the next couple of years. And so any color there...\n\n---\n\nYes. I hope it continues to rise forever. The -- probably the simplest way to do it is look at what it's done for each of the last several years, year-over-year in dollars. My guess it's somewhere around 10%-ish and that's probably as good a guess, maybe if you want to add a little bit to it for IT modernization. When we -- as you know, over a 4- or a 5-year period, we're on an incremental basis, we're probably spending close to $0.5 billion. That generally once these different modules and components are put into operation, they then get amortized over 5 to 7 years. And so maybe that adds a little bit to that $1 billion-plus number.\n\n---\n\nAnd then, where does that depreciation tend to show up in terms of the margin buckets? I know you talked about Central, but is that core as well?\n\n---\n\nIt's all SG&A, virtually all SG&A.\n\n---\n\nThis is Kevin Heenan on for Bob Drbul. You had called out apparel as being strong within softlines. I was just wondering if there were any particular categories or brands within apparel that were particularly strong in the quarter.\n\n---\n\nIt's really all the above. I mean we have made a conscious -- over the last couple of years -- a conscious effort to both with brands and with Kirkland Signature go bigger and deeper, massing out big quantities in the stuff. And so it really is all over the board. Names that you've come to know like Dockers and Levi's and Cole Haan and just a variety of ones, but also the KS. Whether it's women's activewear or the -- what was the men's wool pant. Certainly, there are 5-plus million KS shirts, men's dress shirts that we sell a year. So it's a lot of things.\n\n---\n\nCool. And then just my last question. We noticed that you guys have handheld scanners now in store. As you're checking out, we are wondering kind of how that test was going and just any information around that.\n\n---\n\nYes. Well, I think the handheld scanner -- well, there's 2 things that we use the handheld scanner. And we give some level of autonomy to the operators on that. Some regions embrace it a little more than others. Generally, what we find -- and then I say there's 2 uses. One use is, if lines are backing up, an employee with one of those handheld scanners could go and essentially scan and if it's a smaller basket, needless to say, if it's top full and we have things under other things, you can't do it, but they can help speed up the front-end by scanning the -- in the case of a limited number of items, those items, give that member a little printout with a barcode on it, when the member gets up to the cash register, the cashier can simply scan that barcode. It prints out and tenders their full transaction with all the details. So that's one way of speeding up. The other thing it's used for is in terms of informing people when it would make sense for them to convert from a regular member to an executive member, based on their prior 12 months of purchases. So if lines are backed up a little bit, and we can ask a member if we can scan their card, and we can let them know that based on their prior year's purchases, they would've paid, in example, in the U.S., an extra $55, $110 versus $55, and they would have earned well more than that. And so it's used for that. But we don't do that all the time because as we've increased shopping frequency, the member who has said no doesn't want to have to say no every week and a half. So we do that on a periodic basis.\n\n---\n\nRegarding a bigger picture question. On online, where do you think the mix should go over time? Will it remain a little bit more modest as a percentage of total? And as you look at your gas and the customers, like which factors do people want to see you guys implement over time? And I just wanted to ask about food and protein and fresh food. What's your outlook for the inflation there? And will your pricing underprice the inflation? And how do you see that dynamic evolving?\n\n---\n\nWell, let's start with the last question. I mean, our fresh foods people view some continuation on prices like cheese, and milk and butter. A lot of that has to do with some shortages in China and so increased demand from China that has pushed that out a little bit. There's still some inflation in meat. I believe you said that pork expectation was coming back a little bit. And cheese is, finally, coming down a little bit. So the expectation is yes, but not probably as severe like meat had been up 8% to 10% prices. They don't expect that level of additional inflation going forward, but still some. In terms of pricing, generally, we're going to try to take price increases as late as possible and take price decreases as soon as possible. So now if using the famous rotisserie chicken example, we maintain the price while costs were going up for 2 years, we didn't -- when the input cost started going down, we didn't change the price but we -- because we had never raised it. So but overall, we're going to lag a little bit because we want to be competitive. And getting back to the first question, was on costco.com and mix changes. Yes, it should continue to inch up towards -- when we started, it was all big ticket, in many cases, \"hard to take home yourself\" or \"hard to install\" or \"hard to put together\" items. Whether it's big-screen TVs or furniture or swing sets, you name it. We certainly want it to be more than just that. And I think, again, we've seen some success in there. So we keep trying things. What we don't see ourselves is being the entity that's going to deliver 2 different boxes of kids' cereals to your doorstep at 7 in the morning. Now we hope and look forward to some of these other entities that are doing those types of quick home deliveries to -- for us to be their supplier, which we seem to be successful doing as well. So -- but overall, we want our site to be thought of on a more regular basis as well for our members. And some of those health and beauty aid items, some of those sundries items will certainly help towards that, too.\n\n---\n\nAnd I've used the mobile app. Do you feel like the mobile app is going to be a key part of traffic online for you as it evolves?\n\n---\n\nIt will -- it's continuing. And when we look at our -- when Jenny Ragland presents at each month in the budget meeting about costco.com, we have higher and higher percentages of mobile app use, not as nearly as much as some of the e-commerce entities out there, but it's going in that direction. So yes, I mean, we'll keep getting better. Like everything at Costco, while our site is greatly improved from the original mobile apps that we did, there's room for improvement there. And we know that.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And a last question on the higher-end strength. Have you seen customer response very positive to higher price points or your assortment as we see a healthier, high-end customer as well as your products assortment being very appealing?\n\n---\n\nWell, that's what we've done -- that's what we do. I mean, since the beginning of time, we've constantly tried to trade customers up to better quality. We're still a merchant. We still want to sell a lot of stuff and higher-end stuff. And frankly, we can show great savings in that. If you go into our warehouses right now, it is probably for the holiday time, I've seen some $3,000, $5,000, $7,000 wine and spirits pricings, which are great values at those price points. Certainly, our jewelry are higher end. Certainly, the fact that we do a great penetration in the bigger-sized televisions. So that's something. And anecdotally, I remember also, in the end of calendar '08 and into calendar '09, when economy went south fast, and I remember -- and then, of course, at the end of '08 and into early '09, when we took some extraordinary markdowns on things like patio furniture in January and February because the economy just hit and people weren't buying that much stuff -- those big-ticket discretionary items. I remember, as we entered June, July, as the buyers are getting ready to commit for the upcoming end of '09 into 2010 season, our CEO, Jim, at the time, and our Head of Merchandising, were reminding the buyers don't start bringing the price points down. If you want to come back for a little volume, quantity, fine. But let's -- we've traded our members up, and our members expect higher-end goods, let's keep that going because that's what we're -- that's what helps us -- one of the things that helps us standout in our view.\n\n---\n\nIt's Matt Fassler. My one question at this stage relates to IT modernization, Richard. If you could just talk about qualitatively what you've gotten done and what is still on the come and then how you would expect those additional investments to further enable the online and e-commerce efforts?\n\n---\n\nWell, first of all, for those of you who've known us for a long time, it's going to keep us alive and growing. I mean our view is, is that, we were at the top of our game in terms of keeping systems, old legacy systems, as long and as cheaply as possible. And the recognition is, is that we did have to modernize. We knew that. And we've started that really in earnest about 2, 2.5 years ago getting ready to start that process. So and our goal, of course, is to take us over the next 10 years to double our company. And I'm not trying to -- we don't have 10-year budgets, but certainly, at a reasonable growth factor, that should be what we want to do. We need systems to do that, particularly, as we go into other countries and expand in the existing -- existing smaller countries right now that we're in, smaller number of units and as we global source more. So all those things are imperative. And as you know, we've done very little historically with member data. Don't expect big things from us, but expect many little things, still low-hanging fruit for us. So we'll be able to do a little more than that. First order business to get it done. What has been installed so far. Our -- we've redone the front-end membership system. Right now, if you want to change your address or phone number, you have 1 or 2 ways to do it. You call an 800 number or you go by the membership desk. Well, if 1 million or 2 million of you do something every year, it's one time each for 2 million people, it's 2 million times for us. So some simple things like that will start early next year, early-to-mid next year, but there's certainly a lot more to do with that stuff, even some basics. We also redid the point-of-sale system. And that's in. That's making -- when I say that's in, it's just in. For the 2 months -- the last 2 months of the calendar year, we have an unwritten or a written rule, you can't -- don't do anything to screw up the systems in the warehouse. And so while we've now installed it in a number of locations and it's well beyond pilot and our operators want it, like it, and it will save scheduling and a few other things, that won't be into earnest until calendar -- during half of calendar '15. The -- there's one other thing. Payroll. We just redid the payroll system. And that's for the U.S. only to start with, which is 70% of our company. And that's again something that's making life a little easier in the warehouses. And there's some small benefits to that there. The big benefits are when we complete the things that you got to put these things, including the accounting systems in place first. Our accounting systems are planned to be installed as of this fiscal year end, so the end of this August, fingers crossed. That will be the best time to do it, at the fiscal year end. And currently, we're on task. But we'll tell you tomorrow how we on task tomorrow. Beyond that, I mean the big things that the users are excited about, if we look at our depot and truck fleet operation, there's some real savings on -- and efficiencies in our depot operations that they're anxious to get in place. That's still going to be 6 to 12 -- I'll say 6 to 18 months out, because these are all overlapped. These modules overlap each other somewhat. The challenge is going to be as we -- as buyers who are used to doing things one way, you have to do things a little different. We learned a lot of lessons when we went to Spain. We started with basically a new -- the new SAP-oriented system. And as you might expect, there are a few Costco people who are over there. We've learned a lot, including pain in the behind things. So I think that we are -- we know what the expenses are, and we know incrementally, we still got another year, 1.5 years of that. By its own size, it will level off. Again, I think, looking 2 to 5 years out, is when we're going to -- we got to get over that hump. And they'll be, I'm sure, some growing pains when we make those conversions. But we've gotten a lot better not just doing something and then letting everybody -- all the users figure it out. We -- we're using 10s and 20s and 30s of additions of people to certain departments, focused entire -- taking existing people that know our current systems and putting them on these SAP modernization projects. And so we've done a much better job of bringing good people in and committing to 2 or 3 years, in some cases, those people in that area. So it will continue.\n\n---\n\nRichard, you may have said it, but I'll double check on this regarding the gas. What was the year-over-year decrease in the gas price? And can you talk about gas gallons on a comp basis increase?\n\n---\n\nThe average price per gallon was down 7.3%. And the comps were -- the gallon comps were, I think, 11%. I know it was a low double-digit, 10.5%.\n\n---\n\n10.5%?\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And I'm curious about the buying -- or having merchandise shipped. I had a little bit ahead of sales plan because of some of the slowdowns on the -- in the ports. Where is the extra merchandise being stored? Is it in the clubs? Is it in your depots? Or even offsite?\n\n---\n\nNo it's not offsite. It's mostly in depots or in the clubs. I mean, we were stacked tall. But we turn it pretty fast, too. It wasn't a huge issue. It was an issue, but it was -- in terms of logistics of handling it. But basically, the depots had a little bit more for a few weeks.\n\n---\n\nOkay. So if it's selling it's there. It just gets there ahead of time. All right.\n\n---\n\nThis is Mike Otway for Scott. I think, first, Richard, you had said that outside of pharmacy, that all of the other ancillary businesses saw their gross margin rates up in the quarter. So, I guess, outside of gas, which is, obviously, transitory, how should we think about your ability to get some slight margin improvement on these other businesses over the course of the year?\n\n---\n\nOn the ancillary, well, most of them were up year-over-year. I mean, a lot of it's -- particularly, in some of the businesses like optometry and hearing aid, I mean, they -- the actual mark up on the goods is higher than our range because we included our own cost of sales calculation, the impact of the hearing tech, a tax or the -- optometrist and things like that. So it's -- but it's -- when it -- when volume is driven, its operating leverage is certainly, in my view, better than the warehouse as a whole. So more than anything, I mean, we keep looking to, as you've heard it before, bring prices down. Over the last couple of years, when we introduced -- what, I forget what the -- it's 5.0 or 6.0, whatever the next level of state-of-the-art hearing aids under our brand, we lowered the price point by close to $2,000 on -- by -- on a high-quality Kirkland Signature item made by well-known, high-end people. And we really drove that business. So we saved the customer. We have made fewer gross margin dollars, but a lot more units. Fewer dollars per unit, but a lot more units.\n\n---\n\nOkay, that's helpful. And then, I guess, just switching gears on the international side. You guys, obviously, continue to fare pretty well, given the headwinds. But just kind of looking at profitability of the other international business outside of Canada and stepping back, over the last few years, you saw EBIT margins come down slightly in that portion of the business versus I think in the middle part of last decade that they were moving up. What's changed? And as you add more stores kind of in this segment internationally outside of Canada, what are your expectations for getting profit to move up slightly every year? And I know some of that is new store driven and everything like that, but any thoughts there would be great.\n\n---\n\nWell, I think Craig has said, our CEO has said, is look here the goal is to first get to 3 pretax and we'll go -- we'll see where we go from there. First and foremost, we're going to drive our business. We want to see improved profitability every year. And there's lots of moving parts. And some of these ancillary businesses help. Costco Travel. It's a little but it's growing nicely. We've got new people in, over the last couple of years in our business centers, it went from what I'll call the 10-plus-year test down to we have them moving in the right direction. We got 8 of them, and we'll open a few more. So there's lots of things out there. The global sourcing initiatives does 2 things, it's generally limited resource commodity-type items, in some cases, and then in our view what sets us apart in terms of quality and value, and that drives other business. So there's -- I think we're less looking at saying how can we -- do we want to -- we want to go sit -- do we want go -- first and foremost, we want to grow comps. And, again, taking out inflation and everything else, can we get comps in that mid- to single digit to a little higher? If we can do that, then how we do get top line sales a little higher? And then how do we leverage that? We'll keep doing what we're doing. And we're not as concerned about one quarter or one year being a little less. I know we've gone up and down, but certainly, we feel comfortable that we've got the things in place to keep driving bottom line, hopefully, a little better than top line, but there will be fluctuations in that.\n\n---\n\nRichard, another gas question. I know you love these. From history, or maybe the question be, when you historically, you've moved into a lower gas price environment, big declines year-over-year at the pumps like we're seeing and could see more of, what do you guys tell the buyers to do then? What categories tend to do better when you're having a pretty dramatically falling gas pump prices?\n\n---\n\nYes, I don't think we're smart enough to sit around and say this -- with this extra profit, what we're going to do. I talked to Doug Schutt, our Head of U.S. Merchandising the other day. And his view was, is that we're doing everything we're doing anyway. This helps some. Do we do a little more? Sure. But it just -- it's the -- it gives us a little bit more umbrella, but we're going to keep doing it.\n\n---\n\nRichard, I guess, I got a couple of questions left here. Could you update us on inflation across the store both in COGS and at the retail level?\n\n---\n\nYes, if you look -- here you go. Basically, again, very slight deflation for the first 12 weeks. Food and sundries is very slight inflation. Sundries is very slight inflation, like less than 10 basis points. Apparel is very slight inflation, also less than 10. Right. So that's for the end of our fiscal year. And food, of course, for all of fiscal '13 was up about 3.5 percentage points on a cost of goods basis. But again, for the first 12 weeks of this month, it's ever so slightly up. Computers and appliances and things like that are down about 1 point. Gas, of course, is down, as you know, a little bit. And those are pretty much the pools. And it all adds up to being down less than 0.5 percentage point since the beginning of our fiscal year. That's versus being up 0.5 percentage point all of last year from the beginning of prior fiscal year.\n\n---\n\nThat's helpful. And that's at the COGS level and same as retail? Or, okay.\n\n---\n\nI would say it is the same as retail. If it's inflation, maybe it's a little tick under that because of our lag. But overall, it's pretty close.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And then the second question was, I think, it was in September you switched your interchange or card partner in Canada. Could you help us understand how that changes the dynamics either in sales or profits in the business? And also remind us when you're Amex deal expires or when that's due in the U.S.?\n\n---\n\nSure. Well, we basically have long-term agreements in Canada, and we have one here. We don't really talk about our current contracts. We'll let you know when and if anything happens. But any ongoing contracts on anything, we really don't talk about. But in Canada, again, we made the switch. Currently, for I think about a 3-month period ending the end of this month, we accept both. So we started accepting MasterCard a couple of months ago, and we'll continue to accept as well American Express in Canada through the end of the calendar year. Look, we wouldn't have done it if it wasn't the most attractive deal for us and our member. And I -- we'll probably reverse the order if this was a 10-K for our member and us long term because we're going to continue to try to drive value. And so we think it's -- the transition is always a little bit of a hassle, but we've worked well with both our former partner and our new partner. Everybody acts professionally in this thing, and these things happen. And we had a good relationship currently in the U.S. So we'll see where that goes in the future. But as it relates to Canada, I think we're now up to -- and it's not required yet -- as of last month, we're in the 30s in terms of the percentage of people using MasterCard, recognizing 40-plus-percent of our transactions in Canada, before anything else is debit. And as you might expect, MasterCard has a higher penetration of cardholders in Canada. We want to get that rewards-based card out there and because affinity programs drive sales not only at Costco but drive reward-based credit card programs when we get that member using that card, that co-brand card and the same holds true with American Express co-brand. When they use it elsewhere, it changes and improves the economics for us, which allows us to, again, provide a better solution to our member and continue to be more aggressive out there. So it's going fine, it's going as expected, fine. And stay tuned in the U.S. what we may or may not do in the future.\n\n---\n\nMost have been asked, but I wanted to ask something related to the food side of the business. And I know in the past, we've spoken about opportunities within food like new products, maybe organic, natural, more. And I know you've made strides in -- with some of that. But any update on where you stand with organic and natural and how much you could do there?\n\n---\n\nLook, I think we can do a lot more. The supply chain is improving and increasing every day, not just for us. We -- again, I think, in 2 years, we've gone in the U.S. from about $1.4 billion to close to $3 billion in organic. And that's with supply constraints. So -- and our view is, there's couple of positives from our view. One is, it's not always a substitute sale. I gave the example, and perhaps this is the extreme example of what, for the first $25 million of fresh organic ground beef we did 1.5 years or so ago, on a multi-hundred million dollar fresh ground beef program, but again $25 million, the first $25 million of organic. 80% of it was to existing members that historically didn't buy ground beef from us because they buy organic. And so that was added sales in that line. The other positive is, is generally, in the retail business, organic is a high -- it's always a higher price point, but it's also, generally, the higher-margin item. It's kind of like the sale item you see on white goods is this refrigerator without the icemaker and with a small freezer compartment. But then you go in, you want the one with all -- the bigger one with all the extra whistles and bells. Same thing with this. We can generally make a little bit better margin and save the customer more and have a higher price point item. So, again, it's growing, it's a $3 billion business. And I can't tell you how quickly it'll grow, but it's growing certainly faster than our bottom -- than our top line, overall.\n\n---\n\nGot it. And then also wanted to follow up with the -- you mentioned the LivingSocial deal a couple of times, this quarter, last quarter. Should we expect more on that front? Or more deals -- things like that to come?\n\n---\n\nWell, it's a Catch-22. It worked, recognizing we don't do a lot of it. But we also don't want our members to get comfortable waiting or people comfortable waiting for the next deal. So we're going to do things on a sporadic basis or on an irregular basis. But we, at least are -- as Craig said to our heads of merchandising, e-commerce and membership marketing, try some things. And so we're trying some things. So we're not -- we'll let you know that the things that we've tried generally work, but it's not like we want the change our methodology. We want to also make sure that we -- that the value of the membership is the value of the membership, and -- but we'll keep trying some things.\n\n---\n\nThank you, everyone, and have a good day.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: John Heinbockel (Analysts)】\nSo Rich, I wanted to drill a little bit on gross by category. So 2 were up, 2 were down. The 2 that were down, so fresh food and hardline. Was-- fresh food was solely pass-through of inflation? And was hardline's entirely mix?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nFresh foods was certainly inflation and us holding prices, like you know we do. Things I know -- again, soundbite, anecdotal, butter and milk is way up, and so which is, therefore, cheese, and so you've got those types of items. On the other side, some of it is electronics, that's more competitive and we're part of that. And so a little of it is mix. But nothing really -- in our view, nothing really out of the ordinary.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Heinbockel (Analysts)】\nAnd then, when you look at the 2 that were up, and I take it they were not up a lot, is that solely mix? And where is Kirkland -- I guess, Kirkland would have a big impact in food and sundries, that's where it would show up. Is that primarily driving the better mix?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nHonestly, I don't have that level of detail in front of me. I'm looking -- first of all, none of the ups or downs were -- they were in the 10 to 25 basis point range basically, up or down. So not a lot of jumping either way. So my guess is a little of it is mix. KS helps. But clearly, KS, the big penetration increase of KS from 0% to 25% over the last high teens or 20 years, those increments are smaller now. And so yes, it helps, but it doesn't help like the days when you're adding a percentage point or 2 in a year sometimes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Heinbockel (Analysts)】\nAll right. And then, lastly, you talked about FX and inventory. Even putting that aside, obviously, inventory is under hopefully good control. Is that -- is more of that in-store? Or is more of that sort of backstage building your inventory in the stores?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nKeep in mind, if we're turning our inventories 12-plus times a year, everything's pretty fast-paced. When -- if you are in Canada or Japan or wherever, and you're buying -- buyers using FX contracts because they've got -- in most cases, it's U.S.-dollar-denominated inventory payables, they're going to lock in based on what they've got coming in and when they know when they're going to have to pay in dollars at a time when they're comfortable with -- based on that conversion rate, they're comfortable with the price point they're going to sell in their local currency in that local country. So it's pretty straightforward. In fairness, as you know, it's -- some quarters year-over-year, some quarters, it's a $10 million gain, sometimes, it's a $10 million loss. This time, it was a little better. I think, partly a reflection of the weakness and the strength of the dollar and how quickly that the strength in -- particularly in a couple of countries.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Heinbockel (Analysts)】\nSo nothing you're doing structurally to take inventory working capital out of the system?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nNo. I mean, we do that all -- I mean, that's just kind of one of the mantras that we try to do anyway. Mind you, I mean, this is an example from, gosh, 20 years ago when the tobacco business, which is a very high volume, not as high volume as it used to be, but a very high-volume business and a very fast-turning business. I remember years ago, the big -- the majors offered, let's say, whatever the terms were, x percent discount if paid within 7 days. And then, they came back and said, \"We'll give you an extra 0.5 point if you pay 1 day EFT or ACH or whatever it was.\" So 0.5% for paying 6 days early. Well, it's a no-brainer. But you take a high-volume item like that, and it goes from a lot of -- probably 100% payable to 0, almost. So I mean, that's an extreme example. You've got gas working the other way where accounts payable is probably 600% or 700%.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Joshua Siber (Analysts)】\nThis is Joshua Siber on for Simeon Gutman. Just curious, looking back, how are customers reacting to lower gasoline prices? And have you seen any trade-up from regular to premium?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nI don't know. I think, we sold more premium anyway, but I don't know that off the top of my head. I think, the reflection that our shopping frequency and our comps continue to be strong is probably a reflection of that. Our view historically has been on something big like this, whether it was when gas was going crazy upward towards $4 a gallon in middle -- in early to mid-'08. Did it impact us? It probably impacts a little bit, but not as much as some of the dollar-type stores or lower demographic stores. We -- similarly, are we getting a little benefit from it? Yes, but we don't think it's big either way for us.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Joshua Siber (Analysts)】\nOkay. Just looking forward...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nIt's going to help...\n\n---\n\n【質問: Joshua Siber (Analysts)】\nSorry. What was that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nIt's got to help a little.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Joshua Siber (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then, looking forward, if gasoline stays where it's at right now, is there a change in profitability? Or have we seen the most of it in Q1?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, I'll tell you what that I know. I mean, it's a volatile business, as we know. Generally speaking, when it's declining, it's the best in terms of profitability. It is more profitable at any level that it used to be a little bit. I think, part of that -- and again, we -- it's a profitable business. It's a lower percent of sales profitability than the company as a whole. I think, one thing that's encouraging for us, though, is more and more people come and get their gas. For those that come in -- for every 100 people that shop -- that pump gas during opening hours, a little over 50 of them now come in and shop. And so even if 1 or 2 of those 50 are incremental, that's a positive. We've been helped 2 years in a row now with these outside entities like gasbuddy.com, where nationwide, on average, we're the lowest priced. That's helped. I know our gallon comps in the first quarter were low single digits, which is really off the charts in terms of getting people into our parking lot, and that's good.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Joshua Siber (Analysts)】\nOkay. And if you don't mind, if I could add just one more. If you could discuss, has there been a mentality or strategic shift on the e-commerce front, if you feel you've gotten more aggressive over the past 6 to 12 months?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nI think, the things that I mentioned has probably been over the past 6 to 18 or 24 months, but certainly, we've added a few SKUs, expanded some categories, trying to get people to think of it not just as the place that I can buy patio furniture or a big TV, but also some regular, higher-velocity items. And yes, so nothing, I think, it's been more -- if you look -- if I just look at year-over-year sales increases on a comp basis, it wasn't -- about a couple of years ago, it was kind of in the a mid-single -- stuck in the mid-single-digits. And last year, it was in the high-teens, and this quarter, it continues in that very high-teen, low 20 area. So yes, I think, that's a reflection of the things that we've done, but nothing new and dramatic in the last 6 months. It's a continuation of that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Grom (Analysts)】\nJust to clarify on the gross margin grid, did you say that x gas, the core was down 13 basis points?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nThe core is down, but again, it's almost like -- under the phrase, no good deed goes unpunished, over the years, as I've tried to explain this in a little matrix, you almost need a three-dimensional matrix. Given the gas was strong and gas gross margins were very strong relative to the very low gross margin business, that disproportionately weights those 2 lines in that little matrix such that -- and that's why I pointed it out that if you look at just food and sundries, hardlines, softlines and fresh foods, those 4 core areas, which, gosh, I better -- 80-plus-percent of our business, those were, year-over-year, were down 2 basis points, 2 of those subdepartments up 10 to 25 basis points, 2 of them down 10 to 25 basis points. So the core business is pretty much flat year-over-year. But it shows on that chart that way because of that high dollar penetration of gas.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Grom (Analysts)】\nOkay. So the up 2 basis points would more or less compare to, say, the up 6 or 7 basis points that you posted in the third and fourth quarter?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nYes, but it was down 2 and not up.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Grom (Analysts)】\nI'm sorry, down 2. Okay. I get it. And then, on the CapEx guide, you had a big acceleration from this year versus last year, yet store growth is pretty consistent. Just wondering if you could speak to the delta. Is it IT spend? Is it land? Just what's driving the increase?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, it's also 4 more locations including relos. It is -- IT is probably at least 100 of it. International is more expensive. We probably are spending more this year on depot-type stuff. All -- I'm rounding here, but depots, I bet, year-over-year is 100, 150 higher. So probably -- but year-over-year and the prior year, there was probably 75 to 100 on IT, shooting from the hip here, but the big things are -- and certainly, for the year, that 2 5 to 2 6 number, we have an original budget probably a little higher than that. But we know that a couple of them will slip and some of that assumes land banking for the first part of the next year. But clearly, we are spending more on some of these international locations, in a confident way, frankly, I mean, some of the ones in Asia, as you know, are, knock on wood, so far, have been relatively no-brainers.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Grom (Analysts)】\nOkay. Just last question on the balance sheet, roughly $17 per share in cash. Any updated thoughts on getting a little bit more systematic on the buyback from doing so much each quarter or so much each year as opposed to setting up the grid? And any thoughts on the current dividend? 1% yield is a lot lower than some of your consumer staple peers.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nOur board discusses this every quarterly board meeting. Again, I guess, I've learned that the matrix works when stocks move slowly either direction. We've had that high-quality problem that put a matrix in place, and then, in some cases, we're locked in for 5 or 6 weeks due to a blackout. And then, it moves well above several dollars of cushion we gave it. I think, we want to be more systematic, but I can't say when it will be. We'll talk to you next quarter. But certainly, given that we grant to these 4,200 or 4,300 employees annual grants that are just in the high 3s, 3.6 -- 3.8 million shares or something, we want to at least have that, I think, on an ongoing basis. And we certainly did not do that on a quarterly basis this quarter. But the year is still young and we'll see. We'll let you know next quarter. As it relates to the dividend, again, that's a conversation we continue to have and we look at all. And we recognize that our first priority is CapEx, and then, tied for second, if you will, are a few other things that we'll continue to look at. I'm sure we'll do some things over time, but they will be on a timetable that we feel comfortable with.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Brian Nagel (Analysts)】\nA couple of questions. First, on gross margins, too. If you look at that, you may have discussed it in your prepared remarks, and I apologize, but the ancillary gross margin benefit we saw in the beginning here in Q1, can you just discuss the drivers of that? And how should we think about going to sustainability of that over the next few quarters?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, I mean, the big kahuna was gas. I mean, as I mentioned, I think, 5 of 6, or 5 of 7, or 6 of 7 of our ancillary businesses all had up year-over-year gross margins, most particularly was gas. And so is that sustainable? No. It's never sustainable. You see where gas prices are now, so it's continuing, but again, that can be fleeting. And we've been asked the question, well, when you get these outsized profits, so you're more aggressive in pricing. We don't sit down and say, let's use this many dollars, but certainly, we're going to be aggressive and that's what we do for a living. So I think that buffers it a little bit as well.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Brian Nagel (Analysts)】\nSo it actually goes in my next question. I think, Richard you already answered it. But in a market -- if we look at Costco Gas right now, just more from a competitive standpoint, Costco Gas versus competitors, you typically price below, you're saying that in terms of prices doing what they've done, you essentially kept your competitive relationship the same, even in bearish markets?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWe've improved the competitive relationship, in our minds.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Binder (Analysts)】\nIt's Dan Binder. Just a follow-up on that gas discussion. With all the movement in the gallon comps and the pricing, where are we now as a percentage of sales for gas?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nI'll have somebody calculate it right now for you. Hold on a second.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Binder (Analysts)】\nOkay. And my other question, if you want to focus on that first, is on consumer electronics, you've talked to a lot of strength there. Any color you can give us around sort of the breadth of that strength, where you're seeing it, what you're seeing with 4K TV and competitive pricing?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, first of all, as you know, we introduced several Apple products over the last year. That's a very competitive business for retailers and for us as well. We know that. But we want to have that product for our members. 4K TVs are going well. I believe that on those higher-end TVs, we tend to be the outlier in terms of driving sales of those. But it's still small relative to the entire category, that component. Phone business is very strong. You can see what we've done with our kiosks out there. And not only phone business has been strong, added to that, we've added the Apple brand there as well, and then in the various tablets. So there's a lot of different things in that area that are helping the sales strength. Again, I think, it tends to be a little more competitive, Apple is part of that, that's pretty much it. Nothing out of the ordinary. I mean, it's -- these things fluctuate up and down a little bit. We're pleased that these -- of the strength of the comps in that area. By the way, in terms of the question about gas penetration, for the quarter, it was about 10.5%.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Binder (Analysts)】\n10.5%. And just a quick question on the cannibalization rate. I know it hasn't really changed much. I think, it's like 50 basis points at any given month on the comp. I was just curious, can you give us an idea of what you're seeing on the bounce-back of those clubs once you cannibalize it? Does it come back to sort of historical volumes within a year, 2 years? Has that been changing at all as you've been doing more fill-ins?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nGenerally, it's a year or maybe slightly over a year. I mean, generally, when we open -- when we cannibalize our own units, you might take anywhere as much as 10% or 15% from nearby unit or units. And 1 year, 1.5 years later, you're pretty much back, going forward, not looking back in the past year, of course. And again, it varies, but overall, it's been pretty predictable for us. Based on ZIP code analysis of where the members are shopping from, we generally know -- and what we find is -- the benefit really is, do we pick up a few extra members? Yes. Not a lot. Well, we pick up a lot of frequency. If you have a loyal member that's shopping, I'm making these numbers up, but once a month, because they're a 30-minute drive away from a Costco, and all of a sudden, they're 10-minute drive away, and it becomes a significantly more regular shopping frequency.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Meredith Adler (Analysts)】\nIt's Meredith Adler. I was wondering, I'm still somewhat new to the Costco story. If you could talk about where you see the most potential growth. Obviously, you don't have a lot of locations in Continental Europe, and yet it's tough to get open warehouses there. When you look at Asia, do you feel like you still got a lot more growth in those markets? And what about the U.S.?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, if you'd asked me 5 years ago where we would expect to be now, I would say our goal is to get up to about 30 locations a year by this time. And probably, we'd be right at that middle point of trending from the majority in the U.S. to less than half in the U.S. If you look at this year and next, it's 30 -- roughly 30 a year. Still a little over half in the U.S. I think 16 or so last year. And I think I mentioned 18 out of 31 this year. So -- and that's, by the way, a function that we've continued to be successful in lots of what I'll call newer markets, meaning the markets over the last 10 to 15 years. And while we'll still get another unit opened in the Puget Sound or perhaps in the Portland area one day or hopefully every year to get another L.A. unit in the Greater L.A. market of 45 or 50 units, but they are precision points now where, locations where we need to go. But we're finding in a lot of these cities, again whether it's Chicago, and Dallas and Atlanta, or smaller cities in Florida and the Carolinas or new markets like Baton Rouge and New Orleans last year. So that's probably up to our expectation a little bit about our opportunities here in the U.S. Outside of the U.S., we've got 10 or 11, I believe, in each of Korea and Taiwan, maybe 12. We think that we can go into the mid- to high-20s there over time. But again, they take some time to get done and where. Japan is certainly a bigger market for us. We've got 23, I believe, 22 or 23. We should have a lot more than that, but we went from 9 to 21 or something in 2, a little over 2 years. So we're doing well there, and we just, as I mentioned, opened our seventh in Australia. Well, Australia is, what, 2/3 the size population-wise as Canada, where we have 90 or so units, we have 7 in Australia. I'm not suggesting we're going to have 45 in Australia anytime soon. But certainly, we'll get more than 7. Western Europe or all of Europe is certainly an opportunity for us. It is tough to get in. Even in the worst of economies, yes, we've been successful with about 4 years of effort getting one unit opened in Spain, with the second coming towards the middle to the end of next calendar year. And we're still fighting to get our first unit opened in France. So it takes some time, but we're persistent and we'll be around.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Miller (Analysts)】\nClearly a different question on gas prices, and my historical recollection is that when gas prices were high, more consumers might go out of their way to drive to Costco, and that, that was viewed as a historical benefit to traffic. But the inverse does not appear to be happening. And so I'm wondering what, in your view, has changed? Or, I mean, do you think there is a risk if gas prices stay lower that you may not get quite as much a lift in terms of traffic to the stores as in the past?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nI think when gas prices were skyrocketing back in '08, going up towards $4 for the first time, we were on the news every night somewhere, whether it's a small town in Montana or Los Angeles. And where is the best place to buy gas. And so that certainly was a positive. Theoretically, your argument is, is that people, as prices fall, that will be less of an incentive. I think it's a greater membership value proposition. I mean, when a gasbuddy.com comes out and says 40-plus-million inputs from customers -- from drivers out there, saying that we're the best lowest price nationally by $0.14 or $0.16, that resonates. The fresh foods, second to none in our view. We're biased. But that drives a lot of business. The pharmacy, frankly, the -- I think deserves credit we get for that in terms of pricing. So it's -- the fact that we -- we're proud of the fact that we take care of our employees. All those things are positives. I think once you've come to Costco for gas, and we got you into the warehouse, there's reasons why you want to come back. And I think we're starting to appreciate the fact that it's all of the above. It's some of the crazy KS items that -- or KS items, where you get to buy them at Costco. Well, there are few other places now you can buy them, but we're selling them to those people.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Miller (Analysts)】\nYour traffic just continues to amaze. My other question is on China. And so I understand it's very early with Alibaba. But I wanted to ask you, is there any change in your long-term thinking on China? You did say that there's a benefit of getting your name known there. I mean, historically, you've had some reservations, but are -- are you, should we be thinking that club growth is in the future there? And what might inform that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nI think it's in the future, but if you'd ask me that same question 10 years ago, I would say I think it's in the future. And not being cute about it, every couple of 3 years, senior management, both international senior management and corporate senior management goes over there and looks around. And we continue to do that. And we recognize it's a, look, it's a giant market. We're confident about what we do. We're also very hands-on. And we got a lot of things going on in a lot of directions. And we kind of know -- we know that, everybody says, well, somebody is getting there first. Well, people have gotten at other places first. And when we come in, we'll do just fine. So it will be at some point, I don't know when. If you said what's the likelihood in the next 5 to 10 years? Sure. Next 2 to 5 years? Maybe. Next Thursday? We're not ready yet.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Christopher Horvers (Analysts)】\nSo I wanted to follow up on the acceleration in the core comps over the past year. It seems like most of the acceleration is seen in the hardlines category. So would you agree with that? Or has there been movements toward the high end of the ranges that you provide in softlines and fresh foods and so forth? And within CE, is that TV turning positive, plus the addition of Apple, driving the hardlines rebound?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, that's one of the things. I think, I mentioned that tires have been good this year. Automotive, Lawn & Garden have been good. And it's -- we're out of season for that now. Apparel has continued to be strong. I mean, we enjoyed a couple of years on a compounded basis, apparel comps, apparel increases in the mid- to high-teens. So that, of course, at some point has got to come down a little bit. But organics is helping. I think in the last 2 years, we've -- a little more than doubled organic sales from the low billions to closing in on $3 billion currently. And so that's -- all those things help.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Christopher Horvers (Analysts)】\nSo -- but within the hardlines category, is it -- is that TV and Apple, essentially, that's driven that acceleration? Within that [indiscernible].\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nI would say TV and Apple are probably the top 2, without looking at the detail. Phones are probably in there, too. Phones could be first or second for -- I don't think phones are first, but phones, TV and the reintroduction of some of the Apple items.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Christopher Horvers (Analysts)】\nAnd did -- when you didn't sell, let's say, iPads, were you selling iPhones in the wireless kiosks?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nYes, we are. By the way, as a comment was made here in my office, those are the big volume categories. But white goods are up, not that we do a big white goods business. Audio is up, again, a smaller business, but we -- and it's not just headphones. It's sound systems and all kinds of stuff. But the big volume areas are those 3 that I mentioned.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Christopher Horvers (Analysts)】\nAnd with Apple sort of a point in time add-back to the store base overall? Or did that start in, let's say, June and then ramp-up over the past 5 months?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nI think that's right, but it's not -- it's a piece of it. It's not the driving piece.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Christopher Horvers (Analysts)】\nUnderstood, understood. And then on depreciation, can you give us some color how to think about the depreciation? I know you don't -- I don't believe you historically guide to it, but with the incremental CapEx over the past couple of years, it would seem like dollars per week or dollars per quarter, that will continue to rise for, I think, the next couple of years. And so any color there...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nYes. I hope it continues to rise forever. The -- probably the simplest way to do it is look at what it's done for each of the last several years, year-over-year in dollars. My guess it's somewhere around 10%-ish and that's probably as good a guess, maybe if you want to add a little bit to it for IT modernization. When we -- as you know, over a 4- or a 5-year period, we're on an incremental basis, we're probably spending close to $0.5 billion. That generally once these different modules and components are put into operation, they then get amortized over 5 to 7 years. And so maybe that adds a little bit to that $1 billion-plus number.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Christopher Horvers (Analysts)】\nAnd then, where does that depreciation tend to show up in terms of the margin buckets? I know you talked about Central, but is that core as well?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nIt's all SG&A, virtually all SG&A.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kevin Heenan (Analysts)】\nThis is Kevin Heenan on for Bob Drbul. You had called out apparel as being strong within softlines. I was just wondering if there were any particular categories or brands within apparel that were particularly strong in the quarter.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nIt's really all the above. I mean we have made a conscious -- over the last couple of years -- a conscious effort to both with brands and with Kirkland Signature go bigger and deeper, massing out big quantities in the stuff. And so it really is all over the board. Names that you've come to know like Dockers and Levi's and Cole Haan and just a variety of ones, but also the KS. Whether it's women's activewear or the -- what was the men's wool pant. Certainly, there are 5-plus million KS shirts, men's dress shirts that we sell a year. So it's a lot of things.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kevin Heenan (Analysts)】\nCool. And then just my last question. We noticed that you guys have handheld scanners now in store. As you're checking out, we are wondering kind of how that test was going and just any information around that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nYes. Well, I think the handheld scanner -- well, there's 2 things that we use the handheld scanner. And we give some level of autonomy to the operators on that. Some regions embrace it a little more than others. Generally, what we find -- and then I say there's 2 uses. One use is, if lines are backing up, an employee with one of those handheld scanners could go and essentially scan and if it's a smaller basket, needless to say, if it's top full and we have things under other things, you can't do it, but they can help speed up the front-end by scanning the -- in the case of a limited number of items, those items, give that member a little printout with a barcode on it, when the member gets up to the cash register, the cashier can simply scan that barcode. It prints out and tenders their full transaction with all the details. So that's one way of speeding up. The other thing it's used for is in terms of informing people when it would make sense for them to convert from a regular member to an executive member, based on their prior 12 months of purchases. So if lines are backed up a little bit, and we can ask a member if we can scan their card, and we can let them know that based on their prior year's purchases, they would've paid, in example, in the U.S., an extra $55, $110 versus $55, and they would have earned well more than that. And so it's used for that. But we don't do that all the time because as we've increased shopping frequency, the member who has said no doesn't want to have to say no every week and a half. So we do that on a periodic basis.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Oliver Chen (Analysts)】\nRegarding a bigger picture question. On online, where do you think the mix should go over time? Will it remain a little bit more modest as a percentage of total? And as you look at your gas and the customers, like which factors do people want to see you guys implement over time? And I just wanted to ask about food and protein and fresh food. What's your outlook for the inflation there? And will your pricing underprice the inflation? And how do you see that dynamic evolving?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, let's start with the last question. I mean, our fresh foods people view some continuation on prices like cheese, and milk and butter. A lot of that has to do with some shortages in China and so increased demand from China that has pushed that out a little bit. There's still some inflation in meat. I believe you said that pork expectation was coming back a little bit. And cheese is, finally, coming down a little bit. So the expectation is yes, but not probably as severe like meat had been up 8% to 10% prices. They don't expect that level of additional inflation going forward, but still some. In terms of pricing, generally, we're going to try to take price increases as late as possible and take price decreases as soon as possible. So now if using the famous rotisserie chicken example, we maintain the price while costs were going up for 2 years, we didn't -- when the input cost started going down, we didn't change the price but we -- because we had never raised it. So but overall, we're going to lag a little bit because we want to be competitive. And getting back to the first question, was on costco.com and mix changes. Yes, it should continue to inch up towards -- when we started, it was all big ticket, in many cases, \"hard to take home yourself\" or \"hard to install\" or \"hard to put together\" items. Whether it's big-screen TVs or furniture or swing sets, you name it. We certainly want it to be more than just that. And I think, again, we've seen some success in there. So we keep trying things. What we don't see ourselves is being the entity that's going to deliver 2 different boxes of kids' cereals to your doorstep at 7 in the morning. Now we hope and look forward to some of these other entities that are doing those types of quick home deliveries to -- for us to be their supplier, which we seem to be successful doing as well. So -- but overall, we want our site to be thought of on a more regular basis as well for our members. And some of those health and beauty aid items, some of those sundries items will certainly help towards that, too.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Oliver Chen (Analysts)】\nAnd I've used the mobile app. Do you feel like the mobile app is going to be a key part of traffic online for you as it evolves?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nIt will -- it's continuing. And when we look at our -- when Jenny Ragland presents at each month in the budget meeting about costco.com, we have higher and higher percentages of mobile app use, not as nearly as much as some of the e-commerce entities out there, but it's going in that direction. So yes, I mean, we'll keep getting better. Like everything at Costco, while our site is greatly improved from the original mobile apps that we did, there's room for improvement there. And we know that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Oliver Chen (Analysts)】\nOkay. And a last question on the higher-end strength. Have you seen customer response very positive to higher price points or your assortment as we see a healthier, high-end customer as well as your products assortment being very appealing?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, that's what we've done -- that's what we do. I mean, since the beginning of time, we've constantly tried to trade customers up to better quality. We're still a merchant. We still want to sell a lot of stuff and higher-end stuff. And frankly, we can show great savings in that. If you go into our warehouses right now, it is probably for the holiday time, I've seen some $3,000, $5,000, $7,000 wine and spirits pricings, which are great values at those price points. Certainly, our jewelry are higher end. Certainly, the fact that we do a great penetration in the bigger-sized televisions. So that's something. And anecdotally, I remember also, in the end of calendar '08 and into calendar '09, when economy went south fast, and I remember -- and then, of course, at the end of '08 and into early '09, when we took some extraordinary markdowns on things like patio furniture in January and February because the economy just hit and people weren't buying that much stuff -- those big-ticket discretionary items. I remember, as we entered June, July, as the buyers are getting ready to commit for the upcoming end of '09 into 2010 season, our CEO, Jim, at the time, and our Head of Merchandising, were reminding the buyers don't start bringing the price points down. If you want to come back for a little volume, quantity, fine. But let's -- we've traded our members up, and our members expect higher-end goods, let's keep that going because that's what we're -- that's what helps us -- one of the things that helps us standout in our view.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matthew Fassler (Analysts)】\nIt's Matt Fassler. My one question at this stage relates to IT modernization, Richard. If you could just talk about qualitatively what you've gotten done and what is still on the come and then how you would expect those additional investments to further enable the online and e-commerce efforts?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, first of all, for those of you who've known us for a long time, it's going to keep us alive and growing. I mean our view is, is that, we were at the top of our game in terms of keeping systems, old legacy systems, as long and as cheaply as possible. And the recognition is, is that we did have to modernize. We knew that. And we've started that really in earnest about 2, 2.5 years ago getting ready to start that process. So and our goal, of course, is to take us over the next 10 years to double our company. And I'm not trying to -- we don't have 10-year budgets, but certainly, at a reasonable growth factor, that should be what we want to do. We need systems to do that, particularly, as we go into other countries and expand in the existing -- existing smaller countries right now that we're in, smaller number of units and as we global source more. So all those things are imperative. And as you know, we've done very little historically with member data. Don't expect big things from us, but expect many little things, still low-hanging fruit for us. So we'll be able to do a little more than that. First order business to get it done. What has been installed so far. Our -- we've redone the front-end membership system. Right now, if you want to change your address or phone number, you have 1 or 2 ways to do it. You call an 800 number or you go by the membership desk. Well, if 1 million or 2 million of you do something every year, it's one time each for 2 million people, it's 2 million times for us. So some simple things like that will start early next year, early-to-mid next year, but there's certainly a lot more to do with that stuff, even some basics. We also redid the point-of-sale system. And that's in. That's making -- when I say that's in, it's just in. For the 2 months -- the last 2 months of the calendar year, we have an unwritten or a written rule, you can't -- don't do anything to screw up the systems in the warehouse. And so while we've now installed it in a number of locations and it's well beyond pilot and our operators want it, like it, and it will save scheduling and a few other things, that won't be into earnest until calendar -- during half of calendar '15. The -- there's one other thing. Payroll. We just redid the payroll system. And that's for the U.S. only to start with, which is 70% of our company. And that's again something that's making life a little easier in the warehouses. And there's some small benefits to that there. The big benefits are when we complete the things that you got to put these things, including the accounting systems in place first. Our accounting systems are planned to be installed as of this fiscal year end, so the end of this August, fingers crossed. That will be the best time to do it, at the fiscal year end. And currently, we're on task. But we'll tell you tomorrow how we on task tomorrow. Beyond that, I mean the big things that the users are excited about, if we look at our depot and truck fleet operation, there's some real savings on -- and efficiencies in our depot operations that they're anxious to get in place. That's still going to be 6 to 12 -- I'll say 6 to 18 months out, because these are all overlapped. These modules overlap each other somewhat. The challenge is going to be as we -- as buyers who are used to doing things one way, you have to do things a little different. We learned a lot of lessons when we went to Spain. We started with basically a new -- the new SAP-oriented system. And as you might expect, there are a few Costco people who are over there. We've learned a lot, including pain in the behind things. So I think that we are -- we know what the expenses are, and we know incrementally, we still got another year, 1.5 years of that. By its own size, it will level off. Again, I think, looking 2 to 5 years out, is when we're going to -- we got to get over that hump. And they'll be, I'm sure, some growing pains when we make those conversions. But we've gotten a lot better not just doing something and then letting everybody -- all the users figure it out. We -- we're using 10s and 20s and 30s of additions of people to certain departments, focused entire -- taking existing people that know our current systems and putting them on these SAP modernization projects. And so we've done a much better job of bringing good people in and committing to 2 or 3 years, in some cases, those people in that area. So it will continue.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Cerankosky (Analysts)】\nRichard, you may have said it, but I'll double check on this regarding the gas. What was the year-over-year decrease in the gas price? And can you talk about gas gallons on a comp basis increase?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nThe average price per gallon was down 7.3%. And the comps were -- the gallon comps were, I think, 11%. I know it was a low double-digit, 10.5%.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Cerankosky (Analysts)】\n10.5%?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Cerankosky (Analysts)】\nOkay. And I'm curious about the buying -- or having merchandise shipped. I had a little bit ahead of sales plan because of some of the slowdowns on the -- in the ports. Where is the extra merchandise being stored? Is it in the clubs? Is it in your depots? Or even offsite?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nNo it's not offsite. It's mostly in depots or in the clubs. I mean, we were stacked tall. But we turn it pretty fast, too. It wasn't a huge issue. It was an issue, but it was -- in terms of logistics of handling it. But basically, the depots had a little bit more for a few weeks.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Cerankosky (Analysts)】\nOkay. So if it's selling it's there. It just gets there ahead of time. All right.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Otway (Analysts)】\nThis is Mike Otway for Scott. I think, first, Richard, you had said that outside of pharmacy, that all of the other ancillary businesses saw their gross margin rates up in the quarter. So, I guess, outside of gas, which is, obviously, transitory, how should we think about your ability to get some slight margin improvement on these other businesses over the course of the year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nOn the ancillary, well, most of them were up year-over-year. I mean, a lot of it's -- particularly, in some of the businesses like optometry and hearing aid, I mean, they -- the actual mark up on the goods is higher than our range because we included our own cost of sales calculation, the impact of the hearing tech, a tax or the -- optometrist and things like that. So it's -- but it's -- when it -- when volume is driven, its operating leverage is certainly, in my view, better than the warehouse as a whole. So more than anything, I mean, we keep looking to, as you've heard it before, bring prices down. Over the last couple of years, when we introduced -- what, I forget what the -- it's 5.0 or 6.0, whatever the next level of state-of-the-art hearing aids under our brand, we lowered the price point by close to $2,000 on -- by -- on a high-quality Kirkland Signature item made by well-known, high-end people. And we really drove that business. So we saved the customer. We have made fewer gross margin dollars, but a lot more units. Fewer dollars per unit, but a lot more units.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Otway (Analysts)】\nOkay, that's helpful. And then, I guess, just switching gears on the international side. You guys, obviously, continue to fare pretty well, given the headwinds. But just kind of looking at profitability of the other international business outside of Canada and stepping back, over the last few years, you saw EBIT margins come down slightly in that portion of the business versus I think in the middle part of last decade that they were moving up. What's changed? And as you add more stores kind of in this segment internationally outside of Canada, what are your expectations for getting profit to move up slightly every year? And I know some of that is new store driven and everything like that, but any thoughts there would be great.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, I think Craig has said, our CEO has said, is look here the goal is to first get to 3 pretax and we'll go -- we'll see where we go from there. First and foremost, we're going to drive our business. We want to see improved profitability every year. And there's lots of moving parts. And some of these ancillary businesses help. Costco Travel. It's a little but it's growing nicely. We've got new people in, over the last couple of years in our business centers, it went from what I'll call the 10-plus-year test down to we have them moving in the right direction. We got 8 of them, and we'll open a few more. So there's lots of things out there. The global sourcing initiatives does 2 things, it's generally limited resource commodity-type items, in some cases, and then in our view what sets us apart in terms of quality and value, and that drives other business. So there's -- I think we're less looking at saying how can we -- do we want to -- we want to go sit -- do we want go -- first and foremost, we want to grow comps. And, again, taking out inflation and everything else, can we get comps in that mid- to single digit to a little higher? If we can do that, then how we do get top line sales a little higher? And then how do we leverage that? We'll keep doing what we're doing. And we're not as concerned about one quarter or one year being a little less. I know we've gone up and down, but certainly, we feel comfortable that we've got the things in place to keep driving bottom line, hopefully, a little better than top line, but there will be fluctuations in that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Ohmes (Analysts)】\nRichard, another gas question. I know you love these. From history, or maybe the question be, when you historically, you've moved into a lower gas price environment, big declines year-over-year at the pumps like we're seeing and could see more of, what do you guys tell the buyers to do then? What categories tend to do better when you're having a pretty dramatically falling gas pump prices?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nYes, I don't think we're smart enough to sit around and say this -- with this extra profit, what we're going to do. I talked to Doug Schutt, our Head of U.S. Merchandising the other day. And his view was, is that we're doing everything we're doing anyway. This helps some. Do we do a little more? Sure. But it just -- it's the -- it gives us a little bit more umbrella, but we're going to keep doing it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gregory Melich (Analysts)】\nRichard, I guess, I got a couple of questions left here. Could you update us on inflation across the store both in COGS and at the retail level?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nYes, if you look -- here you go. Basically, again, very slight deflation for the first 12 weeks. Food and sundries is very slight inflation. Sundries is very slight inflation, like less than 10 basis points. Apparel is very slight inflation, also less than 10. Right. So that's for the end of our fiscal year. And food, of course, for all of fiscal '13 was up about 3.5 percentage points on a cost of goods basis. But again, for the first 12 weeks of this month, it's ever so slightly up. Computers and appliances and things like that are down about 1 point. Gas, of course, is down, as you know, a little bit. And those are pretty much the pools. And it all adds up to being down less than 0.5 percentage point since the beginning of our fiscal year. That's versus being up 0.5 percentage point all of last year from the beginning of prior fiscal year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gregory Melich (Analysts)】\nThat's helpful. And that's at the COGS level and same as retail? Or, okay.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nI would say it is the same as retail. If it's inflation, maybe it's a little tick under that because of our lag. But overall, it's pretty close.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gregory Melich (Analysts)】\nGreat. And then the second question was, I think, it was in September you switched your interchange or card partner in Canada. Could you help us understand how that changes the dynamics either in sales or profits in the business? And also remind us when you're Amex deal expires or when that's due in the U.S.?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nSure. Well, we basically have long-term agreements in Canada, and we have one here. We don't really talk about our current contracts. We'll let you know when and if anything happens. But any ongoing contracts on anything, we really don't talk about. But in Canada, again, we made the switch. Currently, for I think about a 3-month period ending the end of this month, we accept both. So we started accepting MasterCard a couple of months ago, and we'll continue to accept as well American Express in Canada through the end of the calendar year. Look, we wouldn't have done it if it wasn't the most attractive deal for us and our member. And I -- we'll probably reverse the order if this was a 10-K for our member and us long term because we're going to continue to try to drive value. And so we think it's -- the transition is always a little bit of a hassle, but we've worked well with both our former partner and our new partner. Everybody acts professionally in this thing, and these things happen. And we had a good relationship currently in the U.S. So we'll see where that goes in the future. But as it relates to Canada, I think we're now up to -- and it's not required yet -- as of last month, we're in the 30s in terms of the percentage of people using MasterCard, recognizing 40-plus-percent of our transactions in Canada, before anything else is debit. And as you might expect, MasterCard has a higher penetration of cardholders in Canada. We want to get that rewards-based card out there and because affinity programs drive sales not only at Costco but drive reward-based credit card programs when we get that member using that card, that co-brand card and the same holds true with American Express co-brand. When they use it elsewhere, it changes and improves the economics for us, which allows us to, again, provide a better solution to our member and continue to be more aggressive out there. So it's going fine, it's going as expected, fine. And stay tuned in the U.S. what we may or may not do in the future.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Joseph Feldman (Analysts)】\nMost have been asked, but I wanted to ask something related to the food side of the business. And I know in the past, we've spoken about opportunities within food like new products, maybe organic, natural, more. And I know you've made strides in -- with some of that. But any update on where you stand with organic and natural and how much you could do there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nLook, I think we can do a lot more. The supply chain is improving and increasing every day, not just for us. We -- again, I think, in 2 years, we've gone in the U.S. from about $1.4 billion to close to $3 billion in organic. And that's with supply constraints. So -- and our view is, there's couple of positives from our view. One is, it's not always a substitute sale. I gave the example, and perhaps this is the extreme example of what, for the first $25 million of fresh organic ground beef we did 1.5 years or so ago, on a multi-hundred million dollar fresh ground beef program, but again $25 million, the first $25 million of organic. 80% of it was to existing members that historically didn't buy ground beef from us because they buy organic. And so that was added sales in that line. The other positive is, is generally, in the retail business, organic is a high -- it's always a higher price point, but it's also, generally, the higher-margin item. It's kind of like the sale item you see on white goods is this refrigerator without the icemaker and with a small freezer compartment. But then you go in, you want the one with all -- the bigger one with all the extra whistles and bells. Same thing with this. We can generally make a little bit better margin and save the customer more and have a higher price point item. So, again, it's growing, it's a $3 billion business. And I can't tell you how quickly it'll grow, but it's growing certainly faster than our bottom -- than our top line, overall.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Joseph Feldman (Analysts)】\nGot it. And then also wanted to follow up with the -- you mentioned the LivingSocial deal a couple of times, this quarter, last quarter. Should we expect more on that front? Or more deals -- things like that to come?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, it's a Catch-22. It worked, recognizing we don't do a lot of it. But we also don't want our members to get comfortable waiting or people comfortable waiting for the next deal. So we're going to do things on a sporadic basis or on an irregular basis. But we, at least are -- as Craig said to our heads of merchandising, e-commerce and membership marketing, try some things. And so we're trying some things. So we're not -- we'll let you know that the things that we've tried generally work, but it's not like we want the change our methodology. We want to also make sure that we -- that the value of the membership is the value of the membership, and -- but we'll keep trying some things.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nThank you, everyone, and have a good day.",

We will not be referring to the slides directly in our remarks, but hope you'll find them helpful as they summarize some of the key points made on the call.\r\nBefore we start, I'd like to remind you that today's conference call includes certain forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are made in the context of certain risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to differ. These risks and uncertainties are described in our press release, in Item 1A of our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and other documents we file or furnish to the Securities and Exchange Commission.\r\nAlso, we will be using a non-GAAP financial measure. The definition of the non-GAAP financial measure, along with the reconciliations to the related GAAP measure, are described in our press release. Also included in our slides are the non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted EBITDA gross profit and adjusted EBITDA SG&A, and the reconciliations of those measures to their respective GAAP financial measure.\r\nWith these remarks, I'd now like to turn it over to John.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Matt, and thank you, all, for joining us to review our results for the third quarter of fiscal 2015. A key highlight was our 5.4% increase in total same-store sales, which was driven by a 4.5% increase in same-store prescription count. Continuing the trends we've seen throughout the year, our script count was fueled by higher utilization in Medicaid expansion states and the success of our various pharmacy initiatives. We also benefited from an increase in flu shots administered during the quarter. As we generated top line momentum, we also did a good job of managing expenses to effectively leverage our sales increase and drive gross profit. These factors helped us to achieve net income of $104.8 million and adjusted EBITDA of $332.8 million, both of which are solid increases over the prior year period.\r\nAs you know, one of our most important initiatives of the year has been our conversion to a new drug distribution and purchasing process with McKesson, which is providing us with purchasing efficiencies and direct-to-store delivery for all our pharmacy products. As reported during our last earnings call, all stores and our 4 pharmacy distribution centers were converted to this new distribution process by early in the third quarter. With all of our stores receiving direct-to-store delivery 5 days a week, we expected to generate working capital benefits and improved in-stock positions to better serve our customers. These benefits were in line with our expectations during the third quarter. In addition, our new purchasing agreement yielded savings during the quarter. These purchasing savings, in addition to our higher pharmacy revenue, helped fuel our increase in pharmacy gross profit.\r\nWe continue to face significant reimbursement rate pressure. However, we were able to mitigate this pressure during the quarter. We expect that this reimbursement rate pressure will continue to pose a challenge heading forward and are working hard as a team to meet this challenge head-on. Based upon our stronger-than-expected performance for the quarter, we have raised our guidance for the year.\r\nAs we concentrate on our day-to-day operations and providing outstanding service to our customers, we're also highly focused on transforming Rite Aid into a growing retail health care company, while continuing to pursue opportunities for long-term growth. A key part of our strategy is to expand our health care offering to provide a higher level of care to the communities we serve. We made significant progress in this area during the third quarter as we continue to strengthen our portfolio of health and wellness services.\r\nTwo great examples are the Quit For You smoking cessation program and our initiative to add HealthSpot stations to select Rite Aid stores. And Ken will share more details about those programs during his remarks.\r\nMeanwhile, our initiative to add RediClinics to Rite Aid stores is gaining tremendous momentum. We have opened our first RediClinics in Philadelphia and Baltimore and will be announcing additional openings in the near future. In many instances, we are leveraging our highly successful Wellness Stores to create an even more engaging overall customer experience. We're really excited about this opportunity to deliver yet another convenient layer of health care support to the communities through RediClinic.\r\nAs we continue to expand our health care offering, we're also making tremendous progress with our store development program. Our team is doing on an excellent job of executing our Wellness Stores remodels as we build up our real estate pipeline to support our relocation and new store initiatives over the next several years.\r\nAt this time, I'd like to turn it over to our President and Chief Operating Officer, Ken Martindale, who has additional information regarding our key initiatives. Ken?\n\n---\n\nThanks, John, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call this morning. In the third quarter, we achieved excellent results with many of our long-standing initiatives while launching new programs to further strengthen our position as a convenient destination for health and wellness.\r\nAs John mentioned earlier, our long-term strategy centers around the continued expansion of our health care offering so that we can deliver a higher level of care to the communities we serve. A great example of how we're expanding our efforts around immunizations as we continue to grow this area of our business. We've exceeded 3 million flu shots for the year, and we continue to work diligently to engage our patients as we educate them about the value of this convenient health and wellness service.\r\nBeyond flu shots, we believe that raising awareness about other immunizations represents a great opportunity to help protect the health of the communities we serve and demonstrate our value as a health and wellness provider. To capitalize on this opportunity, in the third quarter, we launched a comprehensive offering of tools and resources known as Vaccine Central. Through Vaccine Central, customers can visit riteaid.com or any Rite Aid store and take a comprehensive immunization evaluation that helps determine their specific vaccination needs. Customers can also use Vaccine Central to track their personal immunization history and access educational resources. Customer response and engagement through Vaccine Central has been very positive thus far, and we believe that this program further demonstrates how committed we are to actively working with our customers to keep them well.\r\nAnother key addition to our portfolio of wellness services is our Quit For You smoking cessation program. As discussed on last quarter's conference call, this free program leverages the counseling skills of our pharmacists to help customers develop and complete a personalized quit plan. We've been pleased with the customer engagement thus far as well as how this program empowers our pharmacists to provide additional care beyond prescriptions.\r\nIn January, we will launch further enhancements to Quit For You in time for the New Year's quit season, including personalized text message support for quick tips and positive affirmations. We're also enhancing our online support available at riteaid.com by adding video tutorials, a quit calendar and an evaluation tool to identify a customer's best nicotine replacement therapy option.\r\nAnother exciting initiative announced in the third quarter is our agreement to bring private walk-in HealthSpot stations to select Rite Aid stores in 3 Ohio markets in the near future.\r\nThrough these conveniently accessible health stations, customers will be able to use videoconferencing and interactive medical devices to connect with medical professionals and be treated for common health conditions. A key benefit is that most insurance plans will be accepted for these appointments. Adding HealthSpot stations serves as a natural extension to our existing suite of health and wellness services and offers a convenient solution for accessing quality health care in a professional setting.\r\nAs John mentioned earlier, we have added our first RediClinics to Rite Aid stores to further expand the level of care that we can provide to our customers. We currently have 18 RediClinics open in our Philadelphia and Baltimore markets, and we will open our first RediClinics in Seattle in the next few months. By early spring, we expect to have 35 RediClinics open in these 3 markets. As we add clinics to the Rite Aid stores, we also plan to open additional locations in Texas, where RediClinic is already a leading provider of convenient care services.\r\nAs you can see, we're making excellent progress with our strategy to introduce new programs that further expand our health care offering. At the same time, we're making great progress with existing programs that continue to help grow our business and strengthen our unique brand of health and wellness.\r\nWe remain very focused on our ongoing Wellness Store remodel program. During the quarter, we achieved a significant milestone as more than 1/3 of our entire store base now operates as a Wellness Store. At the end of the third quarter, we had a grand total of 1,529 Wellness Stores. These stores continue to outperform the rest of the chain in terms of same-store front-end sales and script count, and we continue to work with our supplier partners to pilot innovative merchandising solutions that deliver an engaging customer experience.\r\nAnother key to our wellness format is the higher level of service provided by more than 2,000 Wellness Ambassadors. As we move forward, we're also expanding the level of service that we can provide in the beauty category. We now have 50 Wellness Stores with expanded beauty departments that feature a broader selection of prestige brands and specially trained Beauty Advisors. Much like our Wellness Ambassadors, our Beauty Advisors are positioned to further engage customers, and they achieve this through product demonstrations, helpful tips and personalized service.\r\nOur customers continue to respond positively to our offering of private brand products, with private brand penetration increasing to 18.5% during the quarter. Looking to 2015, we are focused on harnessing the same innovative spirit that has fueled our success with Wellness Store merchandising initiatives to create a world-class private brand that delivers quality and value to the consumer.\r\nAnd we continue to aggressively pursue opportunities to expand our script file buy initiative. During the third quarter, we completed $39.6 million in file buys and these acquisitions are making positive contributions to our script count performance. Based on our third quarter activity and expectations for the balance of the year, we have increased our file buy target from $90 million to $100 million.\r\nTo sum it up, our key initiatives continue to deliver strong results while positioning us to deliver a more comprehensive and engaging health and wellness experience. We look forward to building on this success heading forward by further expanding our portfolio of services to deliver an even higher level of care to the communities that we serve.\r\nAt this time, I will turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Darren Karst, who will provide additional details about our financial results. Darren?\n\n---\n\nThanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results reflect strong script count and front-end trends, improvements in gross profit, good cost control and continued progress on our business initiatives. Gross profit was improved from last year's third quarter due to a lower LIFO charge and cost reductions from our purchasing arrangement with McKesson, but that was partially offset by continuing reimbursement rate pressure. On the call this morning, I'll walk through our third quarter financial results, discuss our liquidity, certain balance sheet items, our capital expenditure program, and finally, review our updated fiscal 2015 annual guidance.\r\nRevenue for the quarter was $6.7 billion, which was $335 million or 5.3% higher than last year's third quarter. The increase was primarily due to higher pharmacy sales. Overall same-store sales increased 5.4% in the quarter, which was driven mostly by a higher pharmacy script count. Front-end same-store sales increased by 1.6%. Pharmacy same-store sales were higher by 7.2%, which included an approximate 228-basis-point negative impact from new generic drugs. Pharmacy same-store script count was up 4.5%, reflecting higher utilization in Medicaid expansion states and an increase in flu shots. Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $332.8 million or 5% of revenues, which was $50.5 million higher than last year's third quarter of $282.3 million or 4.4% of revenues. The current quarter's results were primarily driven by improved sales and gross profit, offset in part by higher SG&A, which was also the result of higher sales.\r\nNet income for the quarter was $104.8 million or $0.10 per diluted share compared to last year's third quarter net income of $71.5 million or $0.04 per diluted share. The increase was driven by the $50.5 million improvement in adjusted EBITDA and a lower LIFO provision, partially offset by an $18.5 million charge for the early redemption of our 10.25% senior secured notes that were due October 2019. This loss on debt retirement had an impact of $0.02 per diluted earnings per share for the current quarter.\r\nThe prior year diluted earnings per share were negatively impacted by $0.03 due to the redemption of the company's Series G and H preferred stock in the prior year third quarter. Income tax expense relates to certain state income taxes. The lower LIFO charge was primarily the result of a partial LIFO liquidation, resulting from the decrease in pharmacy inventory levels, which reduced the effect that inflation otherwise had on our LIFO charge.\r\nTotal gross profit dollars in the quarter were $122.6 million, better than last year's third quarter and 42 basis points higher as a percent of revenues. Adjusted EBITDA gross profit, which excludes specific items, was favorable to the prior third quarter by $103.4 million or 12 basis points as a percent of revenues. Pharmacy gross profit dollars were higher and margin rate was flat. Pharmacy gross profit was positively impacted by our increased prescription count and negatively impacted by continued reimbursement rate pressure, which we were able to offset through purchasing efficiencies. We continue to expect to see margin pressure from reimbursement rate reductions in the fourth quarter. Front-end gross profit dollars were flat to the prior year and rate was unfavorable. Adjusted EBITDA gross profit was also favorably impacted by additional revenues from Health Dialog and RediClinic, which were acquired earlier in the current year.\r\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter were higher by $60.1 million but 39 basis points lower as a percent of revenues compared to last year. Adjusted EBITDA SG&A dollars, which excludes specific items, were higher by $52.9 million but 41 basis points lower as a percent of revenues compared to last year, as we were able to leverage the increase in sales through our various expense control initiatives. The increase in dollars was driven in part by incremental operating costs related to our acquisitions of Health Dialog and RediClinic, with payroll and benefit costs related to our higher sales volume driving the balance of the dollar increase. FIFO inventory was lower than the third quarter of last year by approximately $255 million, driven by a reduction in pharmacy inventory, resulting from our transition to direct-store delivery from McKesson.\r\nOur cash flow statement for the quarter shows a net source of cash from operating activities of $112 million as compared to a source of $247 million in last year's third quarter, with working capital timing differences driving most of that difference. Net cash used in investing activities for the quarter was $166 million versus $97 million last year.\r\nDuring the third quarter, we remodeled 103 stores, we expanded 1 store, we acquired 6 stores, we relocated 3 stores, and we closed 6 stores. At the end of the third quarter, we had completed and grand-reopened 1,529 Wellness Stores. For the third quarter, front-end same-store sales in our Wellness Stores that have been remodeled in the past 24 months were approximately 321 basis points higher than our non-Wellness Stores, and script growth in these stores was 278 basis points higher.\r\nNow let's discuss liquidity. At the end of the third quarter, we had $944 million of liquidity. Our liquidity has decreased by $184 million year-over-year due primarily to the fact that in October, we used borrowings on our revolving credit facility to fund the early redemption and payment of the full $270 million of our 10.25% senior secured notes. We had $780 million of borrowings outstanding under our $1.8 billion revolving credit facility and had $71 million of outstanding letters of credit.\r\nTotal debt net of invested cash was lower by $91 million from last year's third quarter. Our leverage ratio, defined as total debt less invested cash over LTM adjusted EBITDA, improved to 4.4x from 4.5x as compared to last year's third quarter.\r\nIn December, we launched a financing transaction to reprice and upsize our revolving credit facility. We expect to increase the amount of the facility to $3 billion and to use the additional proceeds to repay the $1.15 billion of first lien term loans that are currently outstanding. We expect this transaction to close in early January and expect annual interest savings of approximately $20 million as a result.\r\nNow let's turn to the current year guidance. Based on our results for the third quarter, we are raising our guidance for the full year. Our guidance reflects our current expectations for continued reimbursement rate pressure and the benefits from the McKesson purchasing arrangement as well as the anticipated benefits of our wellness remodel program, customer loyalty program and other initiatives to grow sales and drive operational efficiencies. We expect the current competitive environment to remain promotional. Our guidance for the remainder of the year also reflects the cycling of a favorable reimbursement rate adjustment that benefited last year's fourth quarter margin and was related to a decision by California to exclude certain drugs from a retroactive Medi-Cal reimbursement rate adjustment.\r\nWe expect a working capital benefit of approximately $250 million as a result of the McKesson agreement. We expect script growth to benefit from the Affordable Care Act, favorable demographics, file buy acquisitions, growth in immunizations and other initiatives.\r\nWe expect total sales to be between $26.25 billion and $26.4 billion, and adjusted EBITDA to be between $1.275 billion and $1.305 billion for fiscal 2015. Same-store sales are expected to be in a range from an increase of 3.75% to 4.25%, including an anticipated negative pharmacy sales impact of approximately 208 basis points from new generic introductions and continued reimbursement rate pressure. We expect a range of net income of $315 million to $370 million and earnings per diluted share to be in a range of $0.31 to $0.37.\r\nThe range of guidance is primarily driven by our same-store sales range and pharmacy margin expectations.\r\nOur fiscal 2015 capital expenditure plan is to spend approximately $525 million, with approximately $250 million related to remodels and approximately $100 million for file buys. We are planning to open 3 new stores, acquire 8 stores, complete 16 relocations and remodel 450 Wellness Stores in all of fiscal 2015.\r\nWe expect free cash flow to be in a range of $325 million to $375 million for the year, including the benefit of lower pharmacy inventory and the acquisition of RediClinic and Health Dialog. We expect to close a total of 33 stores, of which the guidance includes a store lease closing provision for 15 of those stores with the balance of the stores closing upon lease expiration.\r\nThis completes my portion of the presentation and I'd like to now turn it back to John. John?\n\n---\n\nThank you, Darren. Before we open the phone lines for questions, I'd like to thank our 90,000 Rite Aid associates for their great work during the quarter and their continued dedication to ensuring that our key initiatives and new programs lead to a stronger customer experience in our stores.\r\nLooking ahead, we will continue to focus on strengthening our position as a convenient destination for health and wellness by delivering innovative services that have a positive impact on the health of our patients. We believe that this strategy provides the best opportunity to fuel long-term growth, while meeting the health care needs of the communities we serve.\r\nThat concludes our prepared remarks for this morning. We will now open the phone lines for questions.",

Darren?\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Darren Karst (Executives)】\nThanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results reflect strong script count and front-end trends, improvements in gross profit, good cost control and continued progress on our business initiatives. Gross profit was improved from last year's third quarter due to a lower LIFO charge and cost reductions from our purchasing arrangement with McKesson, but that was partially offset by continuing reimbursement rate pressure. On the call this morning, I'll walk through our third quarter financial results, discuss our liquidity, certain balance sheet items, our capital expenditure program, and finally, review our updated fiscal 2015 annual guidance.\r\nRevenue for the quarter was $6.7 billion, which was $335 million or 5.3% higher than last year's third quarter. The increase was primarily due to higher pharmacy sales. Overall same-store sales increased 5.4% in the quarter, which was driven mostly by a higher pharmacy script count. Front-end same-store sales increased by 1.6%. Pharmacy same-store sales were higher by 7.2%, which included an approximate 228-basis-point negative impact from new generic drugs. Pharmacy same-store script count was up 4.5%, reflecting higher utilization in Medicaid expansion states and an increase in flu shots. Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $332.8 million or 5% of revenues, which was $50.5 million higher than last year's third quarter of $282.3 million or 4.4% of revenues. The current quarter's results were primarily driven by improved sales and gross profit, offset in part by higher SG&A, which was also the result of higher sales.\r\nNet income for the quarter was $104.8 million or $0.10 per diluted share compared to last year's third quarter net income of $71.5 million or $0.04 per diluted share. The increase was driven by the $50.5 million improvement in adjusted EBITDA and a lower LIFO provision, partially offset by an $18.5 million charge for the early redemption of our 10.25% senior secured notes that were due October 2019. This loss on debt retirement had an impact of $0.02 per diluted earnings per share for the current quarter.\r\nThe prior year diluted earnings per share were negatively impacted by $0.03 due to the redemption of the company's Series G and H preferred stock in the prior year third quarter. Income tax expense relates to certain state income taxes. The lower LIFO charge was primarily the result of a partial LIFO liquidation, resulting from the decrease in pharmacy inventory levels, which reduced the effect that inflation otherwise had on our LIFO charge.\r\nTotal gross profit dollars in the quarter were $122.6 million, better than last year's third quarter and 42 basis points higher as a percent of revenues. Adjusted EBITDA gross profit, which excludes specific items, was favorable to the prior third quarter by $103.4 million or 12 basis points as a percent of revenues. Pharmacy gross profit dollars were higher and margin rate was flat. Pharmacy gross profit was positively impacted by our increased prescription count and negatively impacted by continued reimbursement rate pressure, which we were able to offset through purchasing efficiencies. We continue to expect to see margin pressure from reimbursement rate reductions in the fourth quarter. Front-end gross profit dollars were flat to the prior year and rate was unfavorable. Adjusted EBITDA gross profit was also favorably impacted by additional revenues from Health Dialog and RediClinic, which were acquired earlier in the current year.\r\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter were higher by $60.1 million but 39 basis points lower as a percent of revenues compared to last year. Adjusted EBITDA SG&A dollars, which excludes specific items, were higher by $52.9 million but 41 basis points lower as a percent of revenues compared to last year, as we were able to leverage the increase in sales through our various expense control initiatives. The increase in dollars was driven in part by incremental operating costs related to our acquisitions of Health Dialog and RediClinic, with payroll and benefit costs related to our higher sales volume driving the balance of the dollar increase. FIFO inventory was lower than the third quarter of last year by approximately $255 million, driven by a reduction in pharmacy inventory, resulting from our transition to direct-store delivery from McKesson.\r\nOur cash flow statement for the quarter shows a net source of cash from operating activities of $112 million as compared to a source of $247 million in last year's third quarter, with working capital timing differences driving most of that difference. Net cash used in investing activities for the quarter was $166 million versus $97 million last year.\r\nDuring the third quarter, we remodeled 103 stores, we expanded 1 store, we acquired 6 stores, we relocated 3 stores, and we closed 6 stores. At the end of the third quarter, we had completed and grand-reopened 1,529 Wellness Stores. For the third quarter, front-end same-store sales in our Wellness Stores that have been remodeled in the past 24 months were approximately 321 basis points higher than our non-Wellness Stores, and script growth in these stores was 278 basis points higher.\r\nNow let's discuss liquidity. At the end of the third quarter, we had $944 million of liquidity. Our liquidity has decreased by $184 million year-over-year due primarily to the fact that in October, we used borrowings on our revolving credit facility to fund the early redemption and payment of the full $270 million of our 10.25% senior secured notes. We had $780 million of borrowings outstanding under our $1.8 billion revolving credit facility and had $71 million of outstanding letters of credit.\r\nTotal debt net of invested cash was lower by $91 million from last year's third quarter. Our leverage ratio, defined as total debt less invested cash over LTM adjusted EBITDA, improved to 4.4x from 4.5x as compared to last year's third quarter.\r\nIn December, we launched a financing transaction to reprice and upsize our revolving credit facility. We expect to increase the amount of the facility to $3 billion and to use the additional proceeds to repay the $1.15 billion of first lien term loans that are currently outstanding. We expect this transaction to close in early January and expect annual interest savings of approximately $20 million as a result.\r\nNow let's turn to the current year guidance. Based on our results for the third quarter, we are raising our guidance for the full year. Our guidance reflects our current expectations for continued reimbursement rate pressure and the benefits from the McKesson purchasing arrangement as well as the anticipated benefits of our wellness remodel program, customer loyalty program and other initiatives to grow sales and drive operational efficiencies. We expect the current competitive environment to remain promotional. Our guidance for the remainder of the year also reflects the cycling of a favorable reimbursement rate adjustment that benefited last year's fourth quarter margin and was related to a decision by California to exclude certain drugs from a retroactive Medi-Cal reimbursement rate adjustment.\r\nWe expect a working capital benefit of approximately $250 million as a result of the McKesson agreement. We expect script growth to benefit from the Affordable Care Act, favorable demographics, file buy acquisitions, growth in immunizations and other initiatives.\r\nWe expect total sales to be between $26.25 billion and $26.4 billion, and adjusted EBITDA to be between $1.275 billion and $1.305 billion for fiscal 2015. Same-store sales are expected to be in a range from an increase of 3.75% to 4.25%, including an anticipated negative pharmacy sales impact of approximately 208 basis points from new generic introductions and continued reimbursement rate pressure. We expect a range of net income of $315 million to $370 million and earnings per diluted share to be in a range of $0.31 to $0.37.\r\nThe range of guidance is primarily driven by our same-store sales range and pharmacy margin expectations.\r\nOur fiscal 2015 capital expenditure plan is to spend approximately $525 million, with approximately $250 million related to remodels and approximately $100 million for file buys. We are planning to open 3 new stores, acquire 8 stores, complete 16 relocations and remodel 450 Wellness Stores in all of fiscal 2015.\r\nWe expect free cash flow to be in a range of $325 million to $375 million for the year, including the benefit of lower pharmacy inventory and the acquisition of RediClinic and Health Dialog. We expect to close a total of 33 stores, of which the guidance includes a store lease closing provision for 15 of those stores with the balance of the stores closing upon lease expiration.\r\nThis completes my portion of the presentation and I'd like to now turn it back to John. John?\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: John Standley (Executives)】\nThank you, Darren. Before we open the phone lines for questions, I'd like to thank our 90,000 Rite Aid associates for their great work during the quarter and their continued dedication to ensuring that our key initiatives and new programs lead to a stronger customer experience in our stores.\r\nLooking ahead, we will continue to focus on strengthening our position as a convenient destination for health and wellness by delivering innovative services that have a positive impact on the health of our patients. We believe that this strategy provides the best opportunity to fuel long-term growth, while meeting the health care needs of the communities we serve.\r\nThat concludes our prepared remarks for this morning. We will now open the phone lines for questions.",
      "transcript_text3": "Darren, can you help me to understand that the McKesson, the onetime, where you talked about it in the second quarter, what reversely you saw here in the third quarter? Just trying to figure out the run rate as we go into the fourth quarter around the McKesson relationship and those onetimes that you called out last quarter.\n\n---\n\nYes. I mean, we've taken a little bit harder look at that. And I mean, the reality is there wasn't much impact in this quarter in terms of a reversal. And at least at this point, we don't see much impact in the fourth quarter either. So -- and kind of the...\n\n---\n\nSo do you expect that the run rate that you're seeing to continue and we won’t see a reversal? Is that...\n\n---\n\nI think that's accurate, yes. So it was kind of a second quarter event.\n\n---\n\nAnd what's changed from your point of view in that the second quarter to now around the relationship and the run rate?\n\n---\n\nLisa, this is John, and I think a couple of things. Obviously, we had to do a fair amount of estimating to belay [ph] this whole thing out across the fiscal year in terms of inventory turns and valuation allowances and how they would reverse themselves through the numbers. And we moved to some debt net accounting in terms of how we're purchasing, so we moved some allowances into inventories. We had a lot of things kind of moving back and forth through this whole process as we made the transition. So based on the way things kind of shook out in the third quarter, we feel like what we saw in the third quarter was more of a -- what our typical kind of run rate experience is going to be with McKesson. And that's what our expectation will be in the fourth quarter as well.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And then it looks like reimbursement was a little bit better in the quarter. But John, you did say you continue to see significant reimbursement rate pressure. As we think about the fourth quarter, will there be more pressure come 1/1/15 as contract terms change?\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nOkay. So we would expect that, obviously for the month of December maybe similar to what we saw in this quarter. But 2 rather than 3 months for the next quarter, you'll see increased reimbursement pressure, is that the right way to think about it?\n\n---\n\nIt is, yes.\n\n---\n\nI wanted to just ask you about the third quarter and then -- and how this plays into guidance. But Q3 obviously was better than what the market expected. It seems like it's better than what you expected as well, given that the guidance came back up. Could you maybe just provide a little bit more color around the areas that surprised you on the upside and what the real drivers of the improved guidance is at this point?\n\n---\n\nWell, I mean, I think probably a few things. One, the top line of our business remains strong, so we had good volume in the quarter, both in script count and front-end same-store sales. I think we did a nice job on the gross profit line in both pharmacy and honestly, in front-end parts of our business. And in the pharmacy, we continue to work very closely with McKesson to implement the program. So we saw, I think, good improvement and strength in terms of what we're doing with McKesson. We continue to work hard every day on the reimbursement rate issue.\r\nOn the front-end side, again, we had solid volume on the front end, which helped. And then we were able to do a really good job on the SG&A side quite honestly, to leverage all that to get it to the bottom line. So it came from a number of different areas throughout the business. It was a pretty solid operating quarter for us.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then just to confirm, on the McKesson side, you expected this $40 million benefit, I guess, in the second half. That's not coming through. So as we think about your guidance, the improvement in EBITDA, actually, I guess, is even better than what it appears since that's not rolling through now. Is that a fair way to think about it? I just want to confirm that.\n\n---\n\nI'm not sure, I'm a little -- I'm off, so I'm going to trying -- maybe somebody else can help me sort of pick up the thread. We did see some onetime benefit in the second quarter as we changed our accounting to deal with the way we're purchasing from McKesson. We thought there might be some flip back from that in the third quarter, which there was not. And we also thought there might be some impact in the fourth, and we're not expecting that either. So I think what you see is that the third quarter reflects a good benefit from the McKesson relationship. That's clearly one of the drivers that had a significant impact on the quarter. Is that...\n\n---\n\nYes, it's now clear, got you. Okay, then last question for you. I don't know, John, at this point, or Darren, if there's any thoughts on next year. I know it's kind of early for that. But at the end of the day, there are some puts and takes to the business next year. Lisa asked about reimbursement rate pressure. Clearly, we're going to see some of that, but that's kind of normal. Is there anything else here that you could maybe help us to just think about next year and things that we should be contemplating?\n\n---\n\nWell, I think we're going to -- I mean, I think reimbursement rate will -- as you said, it's a normal part of our business but it will continue to be a factor next year. I think we are still kind of digesting a lot of rate pressure that has followed along behind the previous generic wave. And we'll see some of that roll into next year, so that's going to continue to be a factor.\r\nWe're going to continue to work very closely with McKesson on the purchasing side to continue to be an efficient provider and be a good partner with all of our PBM and other health care plans that we work with on that side. We are going to see maybe a little bit of a pickup here potentially depending on how Nexium plays and some other -- couple of other new generics. We're going to see -- I think we're going to see a little bit better new generic environment for next year.\r\nOn the script count side, it'll be interesting to see what year 2 looks like in a lot of states that had Medicaid expansion, if it will continue to grow. There's probably some decent chance of that. We have at least one other state, Pennsylvania, where we think Medicaid is going to roll and expansion's going to roll on January 1, so that will be helpful. There are a couple of plans that we were in this year that we're not in next year that maybe cost us a little bit, maybe 1% or 1.5% of script count growth. And we have more Wellness Stores coming, more clinics and more exciting initiatives that we're going to be rolling next year. So we've got some give-and-take, but I'd say overall, we remain positive and focused.\n\n---\n\nJohn, maybe can you provide a little bit more color. It sounds like in certain pockets of the business, you got some reimbursement relief. I guess, can you talk a little bit about that and maybe either by script type or by payer type? And maybe kind of just tell us where the little bit of the relief there came from.\n\n---\n\nWell, relief's a strong word. I'm not sure what that means. Again, there's always a lot of dynamics in reimbursement rate. There are contracts that are renewing all the time. So some are better than others and can impact the numbers one way or the other. There's always, again, the mix of business and all those kinds of things going on in any given quarter. So I think this quarter was a fairly good one for us in terms of some of the things that we worked on, but I'm not sure I can answer you any better than that.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then maybe just a quick follow-up. Some of your competitors have pretty aggressive preferred network strategies in Med D for the start-up of 2015. Are you expecting that to have any share impact on you guys from a script perspective? Or is there anything that you guys -- I knew the answer to that, I know that you guys aren't as aggressively participating in the preferred networks.\n\n---\n\nYes, but I think it's a combination of really 2 things on preferred networks. There are some that we're in, probably 3-or-so this coming year. There are a few that we looked at, and we just couldn't come to terms to sort of get there financially. And there's a lot of others where we weren't invited to the table. So you have that kind of component of it. There are a lot of preferred networks out there this year. I think there are probably more than last year for sure. And so we'll just have to see what the financial impact is on us related to that as we get into the year. We have great programs, wellness65+, that are really designed to help us combat those kinds of things, so we'll just have to get into it a little bit and sort of see how it goes here.\n\n---\n\nYes, but you guys aren't, like, hearing the filter up from the stores that patients are trying to transfer a script out -- scripts out ahead of the benefit design changes?\n\n---\n\nNot yet.\n\n---\n\nJust on Nexium, what are your thoughts right now on timing? And are you expecting it to be a sizable initial impact? Or is it going to be more into fiscal '17 on the boost you get from margins?\n\n---\n\nI think the timing is just a little bit hard to figure out right now. We're going -- we'll probably have to reach a solid conclusion about that when we give guidance, but we're continuing to gather information and kind of look at it. There are some dates that are being floated around out there, but it has been difficult to peg because it slipped several times. So I guess I'm a little hesitant to get out there with the date at this point until -- probably until we button down guidance for next year.\r\nIt is -- as it stands right now, it's going to dependent on how it comes to market. Right now, it looks like it's an exclusive. Whether that plays out that way or not just depends, I guess, on a number of different factors. But in which case, we'll get probably -- it just depends on when it falls because we will go through a period of time where it's a little less profitable, and then it will become much more profitable. So if it happens earlier in the year, which is still a possibility, then by the end of the year, we'll be seeing some good profitability from it. It happens later in the year, it probably pushes in more of the financial impact into fiscal year '17.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then the other wildcard is, I guess, the magnitude the McKesson savings. Obviously, the first half of the year, you're still going to have easier go [ph] comparisons to show. But then in the second half, you're start lapping some of the improvements you're seeing in these results you just posted today. Is there a building of savings that's going to be happening so you could still see your gains in the second half of the year?\n\n---\n\nI think there is. Yes, that's what we're working to do. We are working through, honestly, the bid process right now. And so again, as we get into next year and give guidance, I think we'll have some visibility into how that process is playing out. But we are working very closely with McKesson right now on next year's drug cost.\n\n---\n\nOkay. So you think within the next quarter or 2, you'll know roughly where you're going to be on costs.\n\n---\n\nYes, we'll have much better insight. It's always -- we're always driving every day to lower costs but a big chunk of it, we will know.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And the $40 million that was discussed here is not going to be reversing here in the second half, do you think that ends up being a factor into 2016 or not?\n\n---\n\nNo, I think we're past it.\n\n---\n\nJust a follow-up on McKesson, and obviously, this is the first full quarter you had with the McKesson relationship. I'm wondering if you could give any more perspective on just how much that contributed to the improvement, the noticeable improvement in gross margin.\r\nAnd just to follow up on the previous question, it was my understanding that you would benefit as McKesson's pricing improved. And obviously, we've seen them now close the Celesio deal. They've brought on Omnicare. How does that factor into the benefit that you'll see as you go through next year?\n\n---\n\nIt should help us. I mean, the more volume we put through this process, I think the better it's going to be for all of us. So those are all exciting developments that should help us, both McKesson and Rite Aid, I think, become more efficient purchasers in the marketplace. And we're pretty excited about that, so that helps.\n\n---\n\nSo we shouldn't necessarily then think of this as a run rate of savings that you experience from McKesson?\n\n---\n\nI mean, I think the way to think about it is every year I've been here, we have always found a way to purchase a little better than the year before, and that's our expectation, that those trends will continue. And reimbursement rates will inevitably come down to some degree over that same period of time. And the balancing act that we always talk about is trying to get costs and reimbursement rate to line up.\n\n---\n\nGot it. And look, I know you guys have been peppered on the reimbursement question, but if I think back the last quarter, John, it sounded like there were some renewals kind of up in the air at that point. Are those discussions still ongoing? Or do you have any more comfort or visibility into any major specific contracts that would affect fiscal '16?\n\n---\n\nThere are significant contracts that renew during fiscal '16, like there is in any year.\n\n---\n\nAny more comfort relative to last quarter?\n\n---\n\nNo. It's the same. I mean, there's just -- I guess, what I try to get across to everybody is there is a fairly constant level of activity at all -- at any point in time on reimbursement rates. So that's just the best way I can answer it.\n\n---\n\nSo a couple of things. Just -- am I right in assuming the change in guidance from last quarter to this, I don't know if I'd say the bulk of it, but a lot of that was just not having the offset to the $40 million. Is that a big -- it's going to be a large piece of it, right?\n\n---\n\nMaybe a little bit of it, John. But I think we did, I think, much better than we expected with -- on the McKesson side, one of the factors. Again, we talked about script count has been strong, so I think it was largely driven by a much better operating performance.\n\n---\n\nOkay. When you think about the Jan. 1 resets or rate changes...\n\n---\n\nAnd I guess, John, the other comment I'd make on this $40 million, it wasn't our expectation that it would be fully offset by charges. We just didn't think that the net impact of it was going to be material to the fiscal year. So we -- I think a lot of people said -- based on our comments last quarter, maybe got to the conclusion that it was $40 million in 2 so it's going to be $40 million in 3 and 4, which honestly was never our expectation. We just thought the net of it wasn't going to be very material to the fiscal year. And so that's kind of what we were talking about.\n\n---\n\nOkay. When I look at the Jan. 1 resets, is that more Med D commercial, commercial being more than Med D or...\n\n---\n\nIt's some of both. We have some commercial contracts on Jan. 1, and we have Med D on Jan. 1.\n\n---\n\nBut one not more than the other?\n\n---\n\nIt's a bunch of both.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then tying that in, when you think about Rite being on this back side of the generic wave, generally speaking, when do you think we see a peak in reimbursement pressure or a -- may be a trough in pharmacy margin? Is it -- sort of seems like, plus with the timing of Nexium, it might be third quarter of next year, it's sometime in the early second half of next year, is that fair?\n\n---\n\nThat's pretty close. I think...\n\n---\n\nAnd then lastly, just to transition to the front end. So you said front-end margins were down a little bit. Where do you think that goes from the perspective? It looks like a lot of guys, some of your competitors are kind of going in different ways. But the notion that front-end gross profit dollars is really critical. You don't get a lot on spending front-end gross profit dollars on promotion. Is this kind of a temporary dip down? Or do you think this is more secular?\n\n---\n\nJohn, it's Ken. I think on the front-end margin, it was probably not indicative of a good run rate. We took some fairly big markdowns when we repositioned our tobacco and cigarettes to expand smoking cessation, and that was one of the big hits that we took. And I think going forward, we're just going to get a lot smarter about the markdowns. It's going to be a long process, but we're going to have to move those markdowns from the circular to a more personalized delivery. And so I think we're just going to spend them a much smarter. So if anything, I think there might be some long-term upside. But overall, I don't think it's a big shift. I don't think the negative that you saw is going to be indicative of where we are.\n\n---\n\nMaybe just talk a little bit about where you think we are sort of in the real estate transition. And then in general, as you think about these sort of improving comps and what you've done on the remodels, et cetera, how are we seeing sort of various trend at kind of some of the legacy stores versus maybe some of those, which you've revamped over the last 12 or 24 months?\n\n---\n\nYes. I think like anything, you would expect that we get the biggest bang right after we do them. We see a reasonably good tail on comps. But clearly, the stores that were now 4 years old, they're running substantially less than the ones that we're doing today. I think Darren gave you some numbers on the stores that we've opened or remodeled in the last 24 months. We're very bullish on the progress that we're making in these stores and we think the remodels continue to get better and the consumer continues to react appropriately.\n\n---\n\nI guess, my question is more so if we think about some of the underperforming stores or the more challenged stores, as sort of market growth improves overall, is that enough, even if we're not seeing the revamp, to sort of improve the profitability of that part of the fleet? Or are we seeing the bigger outsized changes where we're getting the comp bump on the remodel, and then we're also kind of getting the improved sort of overall underlying market?\n\n---\n\nI think the non-remodeled stores -- if this is your question, they continue to grow with the overall company. So if the company -- if we post better comps, those stores are moving with it, but they clearly don't perform as well as the remodeled stores. And I think we've said before, one of the strategies is to ramp up these relocations. So as we do that, we'll be taking a lot of those underperforming stores that we still have in the fleet and reposition them to a better location, which we think will help the top line a lot.\n\n---\n\nDarren, maybe if I can go back to your comments about the LIFO charge real quick. I think you made -- if I heard you correctly, part of the reasons for lower-than-expected LIFO, you were kind of dipping into your LIFO layers and that offset some of the inflation that you saw. First, did I hear that correctly? And then second, how should we think -- how much longer does that play out now that you kind of transitioned to the McKesson agreement? And afterwards, how should we think about the LIFO charge as we may go into fiscal '16?\n\n---\n\nYes, you did hear that correctly. So the reduction in inventory has sort of offset most of whatever inflation effect there would be. So I think going forward, there will be some LIFO charge. We still have some opportunity, I would say, particularly on the store side. I mean, what we've done so far is largely taken out distribution center inventory. So there's still some opportunity to take out some more inventory next year on the store side. So we could still see some of that offsetting activity next year as well.\n\n---\n\nSo as McKesson has gone to the direct-store delivery for you guys, are you carrying -- are you still carrying some excess inventory then at the store level? Could you maybe size that for us a little bit where you think -- how much you think we could still take out?\n\n---\n\nWell, the answer is, yes, we still are maintaining the inventory. I don't think we're prepared to size that at this point. We're still doing some work around that and sort of developing plans to address that.\n\n---\n\nOkay, great. Maybe on 2 other things that, Ken, you've talked about was sort of Vaccine Central and the smoking cessation as well as Beauty Advisors. Do you have any metrics on sort of what kind of impact that's driving in terms of your kind of sales metrics or maybe flow through to the pharmacy desk?\n\n---\n\nWe do have metrics. We really haven't released them and probably won't on an initiative-by-initiative basis. But I think clearly, we're seeing some benefit -- the one that we've been in the longest is the Wellness Ambassadors. We started rolling them out 4 years ago when we did these things, and we're now -- we've got 2,000 of those people on the floor. And one of the areas where we really see an impact, for examples, is with flu shots, because they're on the floor and they're engaging our customers and they're also out in the communities engaging businesses. So we wouldn't keep on doing it. We're pretty excited about the early read on the Beauty Advisors. We're being a little more selective on those, but we're trying to strategically put people against initiatives that we think we can get a return. And so far, the early read is really positive.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And maybe a last question here around the clinics. Do you have a target for the number of clinics you're expecting sort of either -- I guess, you've really just gotten started, but maybe in 1 year or 2 years, where do you think you'll be in terms of either RediClinics or HealthSpot kiosks?\n\n---\n\nWell, right now, we're target -- by early spring we should have 75 clinics running between the ones that we have in Texas in the HEV [ph] stores and the ones that we'll open in these first 3 markets. And I think that's pretty much on target with what we told you guys we would do. And we're going to aggressively expand from there.\n\n---\n\nNow for fiscal 4Q, I definitely hear what you're saying on the pharmacy reimbursement changes going into effect for 1/1/15. But I do just want to sort of check the box on some of the positive contributors for fiscal 4Q as well when thinking about sequential EBITDA. I guess for me, there's 4 things that kind of stick out right now. First is that flu prevalence is now up year-over-year. We obviously just got generic Celebrex approved. You should still get a decent holiday boost sequentially in fiscal 4Q versus fiscal 3Q. And then again, I think to myself that with McKesson getting operational control of Celesio, I would think that you guys might get some better generic COGS sequentially in 4Q tied to that, unless it's too early. So I guess the question is do you agree that all of these should be helpful factors when thinking about sequential EBITDA ramp in fiscal 4Q?\n\n---\n\nI think those are all good. I would just caution a little bit, and I -- it's really for McKesson to talk about in terms of Celesio. This is a fairly recent event for them to get the domination there. And so I know they're working hard on that, but I don't know exactly what that timing is yet. I think the fourth quarter might be a little premature for us to see that benefit. But I do think in -- for fiscal year '16, that is hopefully a boost for us. So that one may be a little bit premature. But I think all those other items that you mentioned are all helpful in the fourth quarter.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then just quickly, one of your competitors also talked about that anniversary-ing event, favorable adjustment related to California Medicaid. Is there any way to quantify that just for that delta year-over-year for you guys? Is it greater than or less than, let's say, I don't know, $15 million year-over-year as far as that tough comparison you have there?\n\n---\n\nYes. I don't think we have disclosed that number, but it is greater than -- it is greater than $15 million. It's probably in the $25 million to $30 million range.\n\n---\n\nI'm going to demonstrate my keen math skills. If you look at last year, your sequential EBITDA was up about $74 million. This year, the implied guidance has it down about 30 -- a little -- about $23 million, so there's roughly a $97 million change in the sequential picture. Is all of that contract resets? Because it seems like there are a lot of good guys, as we just talked about going into the fourth quarter. So should we think about then a $100 million swing per quarter in contract rates offsetting all the good stuff?\n\n---\n\nSo I'm not sure I got the math on that, but I'm going to take a stab at it.\n\n---\n\nSo you had $282 million of EBITDA, and it went to $356 million [ph] from November to February. February's usually your strongest quarter of the year. This year, your implied guidance has EBITDA down by $23 million. So instead of being up by $76 million, it's down by $23 million. So I'm just saying that's a $100 million quarterly swing. Is all that just saying we're getting a $400 million rate reset on an annualized basis starting first day of the fourth quarter?\n\n---\n\nOkay, got it. Okay, so I guess we can reconcile on any number of different directions, so I will take a stab at a couple different directions with Darren supervising me closely.\r\nSo if we take a look at the fourth quarter of last year and try and reconcile from there, I mean, one thing to understand is that we did have the retroactive California adjustment in the fourth quarter of last year. And so if you take that into effect and looked at our guidance, I think the higher end of our guidance has us pretty much onto last year's EBITDA number. So we'd be basically at the high end, sort of flattish to last year.\r\nWhen looking from the third quarter current run rate today to the fourth quarter in terms of the guidance, again, the high end of the guidance has us kind of in line with where we are in the third quarter. We do have some plan changes that go into effect in January and February, which we've talked about, which is normal. But given that it is late in the bid cycle for us, we tend to have less room to offset those. And so as our bid comes to completion at the beginning of the fiscal year, we normally pick up a little momentum back on the cost side in the gross margin. So I think those are some the big sort of larger dynamics that are rolling through the number. I have no idea if I answered your question, but that's probably the best I can do.\n\n---\n\nSo just looking at your numbers, they're very -- they jump around quite a bit from quarter-to-quarter. I'm thinking, for example, February of last year to May, and then, of course, this quarter which was above our expectation. Should we -- it seems to me like a lot of things in your business are relatively constant, like reimbursement pressure and script trends and what have you. Is the difference that in a quarter where you don't get a gigantic generic inflation surprise that you produce a quarter like this? Or is it more [indiscernible].\n\n---\n\nThere are just so many more factors than that. I mean, if we walk across the volatility of those numbers, in the first quarter, we were in a massive transition to move from self distribution to McKesson, which we believe had a pretty negative impact on our numbers. In the second quarter, I think we really started to recover from that. We did have some adjustments that came off the balance sheet that we talked about. I think in the third quarter, things are kind of settling down a little bit, and we think we're at a more normal run rate right now on the cost side. And in the fourth quarter, what we see is just because of January plan changes, some additional reimbursement rate again. That's really the broader trend that I think you got to follow across the fiscal year.\n\n---\n\nAre you seeing like any flattening out or maybe even relief on the generic inflation side? Do you think that fever has peaked? Or do you think it's just too early to tell?\n\n---\n\nWell, what -- I think if you look at our results for this quarter, what we basically said is that essentially our gross margins on a rate basis is pretty flat to the prior year. So if you kind of think about the fact that we had reimbursement rate pressure, that inherently implies that we did a better job than the prior year on the purchasing side. That's kind of what you get to. So when we talk about generic inflation, yes, we have generic inflation on certain items, but we were able to offset that inflation with reduction on other items or by working on those specific items that had inflation in this particular quarter, but it's become a little bit of a day to day, battle and a challenge that we work on all the time. So that's kind of the dynamic that you have there.\r\nBut clearly, I think you see an environment change where there are certain generic manufacturers that feel they have more pricing power in the marketplace, and they're trying to exert it. And that is not a trend that I expect to go away anytime soon.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And just lastly, if we think about -- and I'm going to make up a number. Let's say that you can steadily grow your scripts, say 3% a year. You're doing better than that now. Given the mix shift -- there's some mix shift from higher margin. So let's say some of that's coming from Med D and Medicaid, so that's not going to have the same GP. But in general, if you're growing your scripts 3% a year, what kind of gross profit number should we think about? Yes, so in other words, you have -- let's say that's 10 million scripts a year that you're growing. Is that a $10 GP, a $12 GP? How do we think about that growth in terms of a good guess [ph]?\n\n---\n\nI don't know that we've given any GP per script numbers out and probably wouldn't be a good idea for us from a competitive standpoint to do that. So I mean, I think you can look at our overall margin rates and use those to try and estimate some impact of top line growth. That's how we...\n\n---\n\nYour peers have talked about a $65 ASP and a low 20s gross profit. I mean, so does that mean -- I'm assuming you're not too far off from something like that?\n\n---\n\nYes, I don't -- I'm not sure about those numbers honestly, but what we will do is give guidance next quarter so...\n\n---\n\nTwo questions. There was a comment very early on, I think in your prepared remarks, about working with payers to maybe lessen the pressure on reimbursement rates. I wonder if there's any specific, I don't know, tools or things that you have to be doing for patients that would give you better reimbursement rates. How do you negotiate that?\n\n---\n\nWell, we want to be a great partner with payers, and I'm not sure I said we have any particular secret sauce, I think, is a term that was recently used on that front. But obviously, we're very focused on taking care of patients. We're very focused on compliance and adherence and have a number of tools that we use to drive that. And I do think that is becoming more important over time to payers as they look at the impact of compliance on their business and their ability to manage cost and provide good service to their customers. So what we do inside that store is very, very important, I think, to our success long term in managing those relationships. Because at some point, it will not just be about the lowest-cost provider. It's really going to be about did the patient get the therapy they needed. And we think we're doing a great job in our stores delivering that and are going to continue to enhance the services that we provide.\n\n---\n\nAnd is there some relationship between reimbursement and your success at adherence?\n\n---\n\nNot today. Not today, but I think they will be over time.\n\n---\n\nAnd then my other question is you do have some interesting things going on in terms of wellness, the Wellness Ambassadors or the smoking cessation efforts, the HealthSpots. Do you see those things as being important for making you more connected to health care -- and of course, the RediClinics, too. Over the long-term, do you see yourselves moving beyond being a retailer and actually positioning yourselves to be working closely with health systems and physician groups?\n\n---\n\nMy answer to that is clearly, yes. And the best example we have today is Rite Aid Health Alliance, which we didn't spend a lot of time on in this call. But we're now in 7 pilot projects across the country with large health plans, directly integrated into their health care models for chronic and polychronic patients. So that just shows you how connected we are getting into health care delivery in our stores.\r\nAnd I think if you look at broader trends, we really believe that in the long term, health care delivery is going to be a retail-driven model. And it's going to be driven by consumer choice, and we're developing our brand and how consumers and patients think of us and connecting ourselves into the health care marketplace and delivering services in our stores. So that's clearly the direction that we're headed in.\r\nThank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. We greatly appreciate it and we'll talk to you soon. Happy holidays.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Lisa Gill (Analysts)】\nDarren, can you help me to understand that the McKesson, the onetime, where you talked about it in the second quarter, what reversely you saw here in the third quarter? Just trying to figure out the run rate as we go into the fourth quarter around the McKesson relationship and those onetimes that you called out last quarter.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Darren Karst (Executives)】\nYes. I mean, we've taken a little bit harder look at that. And I mean, the reality is there wasn't much impact in this quarter in terms of a reversal. And at least at this point, we don't see much impact in the fourth quarter either. So -- and kind of the...\n\n---\n\n【質問: Lisa Gill (Analysts)】\nSo do you expect that the run rate that you're seeing to continue and we won’t see a reversal? Is that...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Darren Karst (Executives)】\nI think that's accurate, yes. So it was kind of a second quarter event.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Lisa Gill (Analysts)】\nAnd what's changed from your point of view in that the second quarter to now around the relationship and the run rate?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nLisa, this is John, and I think a couple of things. Obviously, we had to do a fair amount of estimating to belay [ph] this whole thing out across the fiscal year in terms of inventory turns and valuation allowances and how they would reverse themselves through the numbers. And we moved to some debt net accounting in terms of how we're purchasing, so we moved some allowances into inventories. We had a lot of things kind of moving back and forth through this whole process as we made the transition. So based on the way things kind of shook out in the third quarter, we feel like what we saw in the third quarter was more of a -- what our typical kind of run rate experience is going to be with McKesson. And that's what our expectation will be in the fourth quarter as well.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Lisa Gill (Analysts)】\nGreat. And then it looks like reimbursement was a little bit better in the quarter. But John, you did say you continue to see significant reimbursement rate pressure. As we think about the fourth quarter, will there be more pressure come 1/1/15 as contract terms change?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Lisa Gill (Analysts)】\nOkay. So we would expect that, obviously for the month of December maybe similar to what we saw in this quarter. But 2 rather than 3 months for the next quarter, you'll see increased reimbursement pressure, is that the right way to think about it?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nIt is, yes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Edward Kelly (Analysts)】\nI wanted to just ask you about the third quarter and then -- and how this plays into guidance. But Q3 obviously was better than what the market expected. It seems like it's better than what you expected as well, given that the guidance came back up. Could you maybe just provide a little bit more color around the areas that surprised you on the upside and what the real drivers of the improved guidance is at this point?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nWell, I mean, I think probably a few things. One, the top line of our business remains strong, so we had good volume in the quarter, both in script count and front-end same-store sales. I think we did a nice job on the gross profit line in both pharmacy and honestly, in front-end parts of our business. And in the pharmacy, we continue to work very closely with McKesson to implement the program. So we saw, I think, good improvement and strength in terms of what we're doing with McKesson. We continue to work hard every day on the reimbursement rate issue.\r\nOn the front-end side, again, we had solid volume on the front end, which helped. And then we were able to do a really good job on the SG&A side quite honestly, to leverage all that to get it to the bottom line. So it came from a number of different areas throughout the business. It was a pretty solid operating quarter for us.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Edward Kelly (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then just to confirm, on the McKesson side, you expected this $40 million benefit, I guess, in the second half. That's not coming through. So as we think about your guidance, the improvement in EBITDA, actually, I guess, is even better than what it appears since that's not rolling through now. Is that a fair way to think about it? I just want to confirm that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nI'm not sure, I'm a little -- I'm off, so I'm going to trying -- maybe somebody else can help me sort of pick up the thread. We did see some onetime benefit in the second quarter as we changed our accounting to deal with the way we're purchasing from McKesson. We thought there might be some flip back from that in the third quarter, which there was not. And we also thought there might be some impact in the fourth, and we're not expecting that either. So I think what you see is that the third quarter reflects a good benefit from the McKesson relationship. That's clearly one of the drivers that had a significant impact on the quarter. Is that...\n\n---\n\n【質問: Edward Kelly (Analysts)】\nYes, it's now clear, got you. Okay, then last question for you. I don't know, John, at this point, or Darren, if there's any thoughts on next year. I know it's kind of early for that. But at the end of the day, there are some puts and takes to the business next year. Lisa asked about reimbursement rate pressure. Clearly, we're going to see some of that, but that's kind of normal. Is there anything else here that you could maybe help us to just think about next year and things that we should be contemplating?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nWell, I think we're going to -- I mean, I think reimbursement rate will -- as you said, it's a normal part of our business but it will continue to be a factor next year. I think we are still kind of digesting a lot of rate pressure that has followed along behind the previous generic wave. And we'll see some of that roll into next year, so that's going to continue to be a factor.\r\nWe're going to continue to work very closely with McKesson on the purchasing side to continue to be an efficient provider and be a good partner with all of our PBM and other health care plans that we work with on that side. We are going to see maybe a little bit of a pickup here potentially depending on how Nexium plays and some other -- couple of other new generics. We're going to see -- I think we're going to see a little bit better new generic environment for next year.\r\nOn the script count side, it'll be interesting to see what year 2 looks like in a lot of states that had Medicaid expansion, if it will continue to grow. There's probably some decent chance of that. We have at least one other state, Pennsylvania, where we think Medicaid is going to roll and expansion's going to roll on January 1, so that will be helpful. There are a couple of plans that we were in this year that we're not in next year that maybe cost us a little bit, maybe 1% or 1.5% of script count growth. And we have more Wellness Stores coming, more clinics and more exciting initiatives that we're going to be rolling next year. So we've got some give-and-take, but I'd say overall, we remain positive and focused.\n\n---\n\n【質問: George Hill (Analysts)】\nJohn, maybe can you provide a little bit more color. It sounds like in certain pockets of the business, you got some reimbursement relief. I guess, can you talk a little bit about that and maybe either by script type or by payer type? And maybe kind of just tell us where the little bit of the relief there came from.\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nWell, relief's a strong word. I'm not sure what that means. Again, there's always a lot of dynamics in reimbursement rate. There are contracts that are renewing all the time. So some are better than others and can impact the numbers one way or the other. There's always, again, the mix of business and all those kinds of things going on in any given quarter. So I think this quarter was a fairly good one for us in terms of some of the things that we worked on, but I'm not sure I can answer you any better than that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: George Hill (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then maybe just a quick follow-up. Some of your competitors have pretty aggressive preferred network strategies in Med D for the start-up of 2015. Are you expecting that to have any share impact on you guys from a script perspective? Or is there anything that you guys -- I knew the answer to that, I know that you guys aren't as aggressively participating in the preferred networks.\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nYes, but I think it's a combination of really 2 things on preferred networks. There are some that we're in, probably 3-or-so this coming year. There are a few that we looked at, and we just couldn't come to terms to sort of get there financially. And there's a lot of others where we weren't invited to the table. So you have that kind of component of it. There are a lot of preferred networks out there this year. I think there are probably more than last year for sure. And so we'll just have to see what the financial impact is on us related to that as we get into the year. We have great programs, wellness65+, that are really designed to help us combat those kinds of things, so we'll just have to get into it a little bit and sort of see how it goes here.\n\n---\n\n【質問: George Hill (Analysts)】\nYes, but you guys aren't, like, hearing the filter up from the stores that patients are trying to transfer a script out -- scripts out ahead of the benefit design changes?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nNot yet.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Wiltamuth (Analysts)】\nJust on Nexium, what are your thoughts right now on timing? And are you expecting it to be a sizable initial impact? Or is it going to be more into fiscal '17 on the boost you get from margins?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nI think the timing is just a little bit hard to figure out right now. We're going -- we'll probably have to reach a solid conclusion about that when we give guidance, but we're continuing to gather information and kind of look at it. There are some dates that are being floated around out there, but it has been difficult to peg because it slipped several times. So I guess I'm a little hesitant to get out there with the date at this point until -- probably until we button down guidance for next year.\r\nIt is -- as it stands right now, it's going to dependent on how it comes to market. Right now, it looks like it's an exclusive. Whether that plays out that way or not just depends, I guess, on a number of different factors. But in which case, we'll get probably -- it just depends on when it falls because we will go through a period of time where it's a little less profitable, and then it will become much more profitable. So if it happens earlier in the year, which is still a possibility, then by the end of the year, we'll be seeing some good profitability from it. It happens later in the year, it probably pushes in more of the financial impact into fiscal year '17.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Wiltamuth (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then the other wildcard is, I guess, the magnitude the McKesson savings. Obviously, the first half of the year, you're still going to have easier go [ph] comparisons to show. But then in the second half, you're start lapping some of the improvements you're seeing in these results you just posted today. Is there a building of savings that's going to be happening so you could still see your gains in the second half of the year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nI think there is. Yes, that's what we're working to do. We are working through, honestly, the bid process right now. And so again, as we get into next year and give guidance, I think we'll have some visibility into how that process is playing out. But we are working very closely with McKesson right now on next year's drug cost.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Wiltamuth (Analysts)】\nOkay. So you think within the next quarter or 2, you'll know roughly where you're going to be on costs.\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nYes, we'll have much better insight. It's always -- we're always driving every day to lower costs but a big chunk of it, we will know.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Wiltamuth (Analysts)】\nOkay. And the $40 million that was discussed here is not going to be reversing here in the second half, do you think that ends up being a factor into 2016 or not?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nNo, I think we're past it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Jones (Analysts)】\nJust a follow-up on McKesson, and obviously, this is the first full quarter you had with the McKesson relationship. I'm wondering if you could give any more perspective on just how much that contributed to the improvement, the noticeable improvement in gross margin.\r\nAnd just to follow up on the previous question, it was my understanding that you would benefit as McKesson's pricing improved. And obviously, we've seen them now close the Celesio deal. They've brought on Omnicare. How does that factor into the benefit that you'll see as you go through next year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nIt should help us. I mean, the more volume we put through this process, I think the better it's going to be for all of us. So those are all exciting developments that should help us, both McKesson and Rite Aid, I think, become more efficient purchasers in the marketplace. And we're pretty excited about that, so that helps.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Jones (Analysts)】\nSo we shouldn't necessarily then think of this as a run rate of savings that you experience from McKesson?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nI mean, I think the way to think about it is every year I've been here, we have always found a way to purchase a little better than the year before, and that's our expectation, that those trends will continue. And reimbursement rates will inevitably come down to some degree over that same period of time. And the balancing act that we always talk about is trying to get costs and reimbursement rate to line up.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Jones (Analysts)】\nGot it. And look, I know you guys have been peppered on the reimbursement question, but if I think back the last quarter, John, it sounded like there were some renewals kind of up in the air at that point. Are those discussions still ongoing? Or do you have any more comfort or visibility into any major specific contracts that would affect fiscal '16?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nThere are significant contracts that renew during fiscal '16, like there is in any year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Jones (Analysts)】\nAny more comfort relative to last quarter?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nNo. It's the same. I mean, there's just -- I guess, what I try to get across to everybody is there is a fairly constant level of activity at all -- at any point in time on reimbursement rates. So that's just the best way I can answer it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Heinbockel (Analysts)】\nSo a couple of things. Just -- am I right in assuming the change in guidance from last quarter to this, I don't know if I'd say the bulk of it, but a lot of that was just not having the offset to the $40 million. Is that a big -- it's going to be a large piece of it, right?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nMaybe a little bit of it, John. But I think we did, I think, much better than we expected with -- on the McKesson side, one of the factors. Again, we talked about script count has been strong, so I think it was largely driven by a much better operating performance.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Heinbockel (Analysts)】\nOkay. When you think about the Jan. 1 resets or rate changes...\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nAnd I guess, John, the other comment I'd make on this $40 million, it wasn't our expectation that it would be fully offset by charges. We just didn't think that the net impact of it was going to be material to the fiscal year. So we -- I think a lot of people said -- based on our comments last quarter, maybe got to the conclusion that it was $40 million in 2 so it's going to be $40 million in 3 and 4, which honestly was never our expectation. We just thought the net of it wasn't going to be very material to the fiscal year. And so that's kind of what we were talking about.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Heinbockel (Analysts)】\nOkay. When I look at the Jan. 1 resets, is that more Med D commercial, commercial being more than Med D or...\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nIt's some of both. We have some commercial contracts on Jan. 1, and we have Med D on Jan. 1.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Heinbockel (Analysts)】\nBut one not more than the other?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nIt's a bunch of both.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Heinbockel (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then tying that in, when you think about Rite being on this back side of the generic wave, generally speaking, when do you think we see a peak in reimbursement pressure or a -- may be a trough in pharmacy margin? Is it -- sort of seems like, plus with the timing of Nexium, it might be third quarter of next year, it's sometime in the early second half of next year, is that fair?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nThat's pretty close. I think...\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Heinbockel (Analysts)】\nAnd then lastly, just to transition to the front end. So you said front-end margins were down a little bit. Where do you think that goes from the perspective? It looks like a lot of guys, some of your competitors are kind of going in different ways. But the notion that front-end gross profit dollars is really critical. You don't get a lot on spending front-end gross profit dollars on promotion. Is this kind of a temporary dip down? Or do you think this is more secular?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kenneth Martindale (Executives)】\nJohn, it's Ken. I think on the front-end margin, it was probably not indicative of a good run rate. We took some fairly big markdowns when we repositioned our tobacco and cigarettes to expand smoking cessation, and that was one of the big hits that we took. And I think going forward, we're just going to get a lot smarter about the markdowns. It's going to be a long process, but we're going to have to move those markdowns from the circular to a more personalized delivery. And so I think we're just going to spend them a much smarter. So if anything, I think there might be some long-term upside. But overall, I don't think it's a big shift. I don't think the negative that you saw is going to be indicative of where we are.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ross Muken (Analysts)】\nMaybe just talk a little bit about where you think we are sort of in the real estate transition. And then in general, as you think about these sort of improving comps and what you've done on the remodels, et cetera, how are we seeing sort of various trend at kind of some of the legacy stores versus maybe some of those, which you've revamped over the last 12 or 24 months?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kenneth Martindale (Executives)】\nYes. I think like anything, you would expect that we get the biggest bang right after we do them. We see a reasonably good tail on comps. But clearly, the stores that were now 4 years old, they're running substantially less than the ones that we're doing today. I think Darren gave you some numbers on the stores that we've opened or remodeled in the last 24 months. We're very bullish on the progress that we're making in these stores and we think the remodels continue to get better and the consumer continues to react appropriately.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ross Muken (Analysts)】\nI guess, my question is more so if we think about some of the underperforming stores or the more challenged stores, as sort of market growth improves overall, is that enough, even if we're not seeing the revamp, to sort of improve the profitability of that part of the fleet? Or are we seeing the bigger outsized changes where we're getting the comp bump on the remodel, and then we're also kind of getting the improved sort of overall underlying market?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kenneth Martindale (Executives)】\nI think the non-remodeled stores -- if this is your question, they continue to grow with the overall company. So if the company -- if we post better comps, those stores are moving with it, but they clearly don't perform as well as the remodeled stores. And I think we've said before, one of the strategies is to ramp up these relocations. So as we do that, we'll be taking a lot of those underperforming stores that we still have in the fleet and reposition them to a better location, which we think will help the top line a lot.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Rhyee (Analysts)】\nDarren, maybe if I can go back to your comments about the LIFO charge real quick. I think you made -- if I heard you correctly, part of the reasons for lower-than-expected LIFO, you were kind of dipping into your LIFO layers and that offset some of the inflation that you saw. First, did I hear that correctly? And then second, how should we think -- how much longer does that play out now that you kind of transitioned to the McKesson agreement? And afterwards, how should we think about the LIFO charge as we may go into fiscal '16?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Darren Karst (Executives)】\nYes, you did hear that correctly. So the reduction in inventory has sort of offset most of whatever inflation effect there would be. So I think going forward, there will be some LIFO charge. We still have some opportunity, I would say, particularly on the store side. I mean, what we've done so far is largely taken out distribution center inventory. So there's still some opportunity to take out some more inventory next year on the store side. So we could still see some of that offsetting activity next year as well.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Rhyee (Analysts)】\nSo as McKesson has gone to the direct-store delivery for you guys, are you carrying -- are you still carrying some excess inventory then at the store level? Could you maybe size that for us a little bit where you think -- how much you think we could still take out?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Darren Karst (Executives)】\nWell, the answer is, yes, we still are maintaining the inventory. I don't think we're prepared to size that at this point. We're still doing some work around that and sort of developing plans to address that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Rhyee (Analysts)】\nOkay, great. Maybe on 2 other things that, Ken, you've talked about was sort of Vaccine Central and the smoking cessation as well as Beauty Advisors. Do you have any metrics on sort of what kind of impact that's driving in terms of your kind of sales metrics or maybe flow through to the pharmacy desk?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kenneth Martindale (Executives)】\nWe do have metrics. We really haven't released them and probably won't on an initiative-by-initiative basis. But I think clearly, we're seeing some benefit -- the one that we've been in the longest is the Wellness Ambassadors. We started rolling them out 4 years ago when we did these things, and we're now -- we've got 2,000 of those people on the floor. And one of the areas where we really see an impact, for examples, is with flu shots, because they're on the floor and they're engaging our customers and they're also out in the communities engaging businesses. So we wouldn't keep on doing it. We're pretty excited about the early read on the Beauty Advisors. We're being a little more selective on those, but we're trying to strategically put people against initiatives that we think we can get a return. And so far, the early read is really positive.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Rhyee (Analysts)】\nGreat. And maybe a last question here around the clinics. Do you have a target for the number of clinics you're expecting sort of either -- I guess, you've really just gotten started, but maybe in 1 year or 2 years, where do you think you'll be in terms of either RediClinics or HealthSpot kiosks?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kenneth Martindale (Executives)】\nWell, right now, we're target -- by early spring we should have 75 clinics running between the ones that we have in Texas in the HEV [ph] stores and the ones that we'll open in these first 3 markets. And I think that's pretty much on target with what we told you guys we would do. And we're going to aggressively expand from there.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Steven Valiquette (Analysts)】\nNow for fiscal 4Q, I definitely hear what you're saying on the pharmacy reimbursement changes going into effect for 1/1/15. But I do just want to sort of check the box on some of the positive contributors for fiscal 4Q as well when thinking about sequential EBITDA. I guess for me, there's 4 things that kind of stick out right now. First is that flu prevalence is now up year-over-year. We obviously just got generic Celebrex approved. You should still get a decent holiday boost sequentially in fiscal 4Q versus fiscal 3Q. And then again, I think to myself that with McKesson getting operational control of Celesio, I would think that you guys might get some better generic COGS sequentially in 4Q tied to that, unless it's too early. So I guess the question is do you agree that all of these should be helpful factors when thinking about sequential EBITDA ramp in fiscal 4Q?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nI think those are all good. I would just caution a little bit, and I -- it's really for McKesson to talk about in terms of Celesio. This is a fairly recent event for them to get the domination there. And so I know they're working hard on that, but I don't know exactly what that timing is yet. I think the fourth quarter might be a little premature for us to see that benefit. But I do think in -- for fiscal year '16, that is hopefully a boost for us. So that one may be a little bit premature. But I think all those other items that you mentioned are all helpful in the fourth quarter.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Steven Valiquette (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then just quickly, one of your competitors also talked about that anniversary-ing event, favorable adjustment related to California Medicaid. Is there any way to quantify that just for that delta year-over-year for you guys? Is it greater than or less than, let's say, I don't know, $15 million year-over-year as far as that tough comparison you have there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Darren Karst (Executives)】\nYes. I don't think we have disclosed that number, but it is greater than -- it is greater than $15 million. It's probably in the $25 million to $30 million range.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Ransom (Analysts)】\nI'm going to demonstrate my keen math skills. If you look at last year, your sequential EBITDA was up about $74 million. This year, the implied guidance has it down about 30 -- a little -- about $23 million, so there's roughly a $97 million change in the sequential picture. Is all of that contract resets? Because it seems like there are a lot of good guys, as we just talked about going into the fourth quarter. So should we think about then a $100 million swing per quarter in contract rates offsetting all the good stuff?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nSo I'm not sure I got the math on that, but I'm going to take a stab at it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Ransom (Analysts)】\nSo you had $282 million of EBITDA, and it went to $356 million [ph] from November to February. February's usually your strongest quarter of the year. This year, your implied guidance has EBITDA down by $23 million. So instead of being up by $76 million, it's down by $23 million. So I'm just saying that's a $100 million quarterly swing. Is all that just saying we're getting a $400 million rate reset on an annualized basis starting first day of the fourth quarter?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nOkay, got it. Okay, so I guess we can reconcile on any number of different directions, so I will take a stab at a couple different directions with Darren supervising me closely.\r\nSo if we take a look at the fourth quarter of last year and try and reconcile from there, I mean, one thing to understand is that we did have the retroactive California adjustment in the fourth quarter of last year. And so if you take that into effect and looked at our guidance, I think the higher end of our guidance has us pretty much onto last year's EBITDA number. So we'd be basically at the high end, sort of flattish to last year.\r\nWhen looking from the third quarter current run rate today to the fourth quarter in terms of the guidance, again, the high end of the guidance has us kind of in line with where we are in the third quarter. We do have some plan changes that go into effect in January and February, which we've talked about, which is normal. But given that it is late in the bid cycle for us, we tend to have less room to offset those. And so as our bid comes to completion at the beginning of the fiscal year, we normally pick up a little momentum back on the cost side in the gross margin. So I think those are some the big sort of larger dynamics that are rolling through the number. I have no idea if I answered your question, but that's probably the best I can do.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Ransom (Analysts)】\nSo just looking at your numbers, they're very -- they jump around quite a bit from quarter-to-quarter. I'm thinking, for example, February of last year to May, and then, of course, this quarter which was above our expectation. Should we -- it seems to me like a lot of things in your business are relatively constant, like reimbursement pressure and script trends and what have you. Is the difference that in a quarter where you don't get a gigantic generic inflation surprise that you produce a quarter like this? Or is it more [indiscernible].\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nThere are just so many more factors than that. I mean, if we walk across the volatility of those numbers, in the first quarter, we were in a massive transition to move from self distribution to McKesson, which we believe had a pretty negative impact on our numbers. In the second quarter, I think we really started to recover from that. We did have some adjustments that came off the balance sheet that we talked about. I think in the third quarter, things are kind of settling down a little bit, and we think we're at a more normal run rate right now on the cost side. And in the fourth quarter, what we see is just because of January plan changes, some additional reimbursement rate again. That's really the broader trend that I think you got to follow across the fiscal year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Ransom (Analysts)】\nAre you seeing like any flattening out or maybe even relief on the generic inflation side? Do you think that fever has peaked? Or do you think it's just too early to tell?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nWell, what -- I think if you look at our results for this quarter, what we basically said is that essentially our gross margins on a rate basis is pretty flat to the prior year. So if you kind of think about the fact that we had reimbursement rate pressure, that inherently implies that we did a better job than the prior year on the purchasing side. That's kind of what you get to. So when we talk about generic inflation, yes, we have generic inflation on certain items, but we were able to offset that inflation with reduction on other items or by working on those specific items that had inflation in this particular quarter, but it's become a little bit of a day to day, battle and a challenge that we work on all the time. So that's kind of the dynamic that you have there.\r\nBut clearly, I think you see an environment change where there are certain generic manufacturers that feel they have more pricing power in the marketplace, and they're trying to exert it. And that is not a trend that I expect to go away anytime soon.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Ransom (Analysts)】\nOkay. And just lastly, if we think about -- and I'm going to make up a number. Let's say that you can steadily grow your scripts, say 3% a year. You're doing better than that now. Given the mix shift -- there's some mix shift from higher margin. So let's say some of that's coming from Med D and Medicaid, so that's not going to have the same GP. But in general, if you're growing your scripts 3% a year, what kind of gross profit number should we think about? Yes, so in other words, you have -- let's say that's 10 million scripts a year that you're growing. Is that a $10 GP, a $12 GP? How do we think about that growth in terms of a good guess [ph]?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nI don't know that we've given any GP per script numbers out and probably wouldn't be a good idea for us from a competitive standpoint to do that. So I mean, I think you can look at our overall margin rates and use those to try and estimate some impact of top line growth. That's how we...\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Ransom (Analysts)】\nYour peers have talked about a $65 ASP and a low 20s gross profit. I mean, so does that mean -- I'm assuming you're not too far off from something like that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nYes, I don't -- I'm not sure about those numbers honestly, but what we will do is give guidance next quarter so...\n\n---\n\n【質問: Meredith Adler (Analysts)】\nTwo questions. There was a comment very early on, I think in your prepared remarks, about working with payers to maybe lessen the pressure on reimbursement rates. I wonder if there's any specific, I don't know, tools or things that you have to be doing for patients that would give you better reimbursement rates. How do you negotiate that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nWell, we want to be a great partner with payers, and I'm not sure I said we have any particular secret sauce, I think, is a term that was recently used on that front. But obviously, we're very focused on taking care of patients. We're very focused on compliance and adherence and have a number of tools that we use to drive that. And I do think that is becoming more important over time to payers as they look at the impact of compliance on their business and their ability to manage cost and provide good service to their customers. So what we do inside that store is very, very important, I think, to our success long term in managing those relationships. Because at some point, it will not just be about the lowest-cost provider. It's really going to be about did the patient get the therapy they needed. And we think we're doing a great job in our stores delivering that and are going to continue to enhance the services that we provide.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Meredith Adler (Analysts)】\nAnd is there some relationship between reimbursement and your success at adherence?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nNot today. Not today, but I think they will be over time.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Meredith Adler (Analysts)】\nAnd then my other question is you do have some interesting things going on in terms of wellness, the Wellness Ambassadors or the smoking cessation efforts, the HealthSpots. Do you see those things as being important for making you more connected to health care -- and of course, the RediClinics, too. Over the long-term, do you see yourselves moving beyond being a retailer and actually positioning yourselves to be working closely with health systems and physician groups?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nMy answer to that is clearly, yes. And the best example we have today is Rite Aid Health Alliance, which we didn't spend a lot of time on in this call. But we're now in 7 pilot projects across the country with large health plans, directly integrated into their health care models for chronic and polychronic patients. So that just shows you how connected we are getting into health care delivery in our stores.\r\nAnd I think if you look at broader trends, we really believe that in the long term, health care delivery is going to be a retail-driven model. And it's going to be driven by consumer choice, and we're developing our brand and how consumers and patients think of us and connecting ourselves into the health care marketplace and delivering services in our stores. So that's clearly the direction that we're headed in.\r\nThank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. We greatly appreciate it and we'll talk to you soon. Happy holidays.",

It was a record year for RBC with record results in all of our business segments, reflecting the strength of our client-focused strategy. We met or exceeded all of our financial performance objectives. We earned $9 billion, up 8% from last year. We delivered a return on equity of 19%, holding higher capital, and we increased our dividend 12%, all of which helped drive strong share -- total shareholder returns. \r\nLet me start by sharing my perspective on the year. Beginning with Canadian Banking. We had record earnings, up 7% from last year, reflecting solid volume growth, strong fee-based revenue and market share gains across nearly all of our businesses. Overall, I believe these results demonstrate the ability of our franchise to adapt to the forces of change in our business and to shift from consumer borrowing to savings and investments with changing client preferences driven by technology. \r\nAs expected, we saw consumer lending moderate following many years of strong credit growth, but we've been planning for this shift for some time. In fact, we spent the last decade enhancing our suite of savings and investment solutions and increasing the number of investment professionals. We believe our approach is working. Over the last year, we achieved double-digit growth in mutual fund revenue and 6% growth in deposits, including 12% growth in core checking balances. \r\nTurning to our business clients. This year, we saw an increase in activity, in particular in the small business segment where RBC is a leader with over 30% market share. This is an important segment for us as we not only serve the needs of the business, we also provide advice and services to the business owner. Additionally, small business clients are a source of deposits and often grow into commercial accounts over time. \r\nThis is a competitive market. To differentiate our offering, we are leveraging our scale to create specialized industry verticals, which enable our account managers to provide targeted solutions. We're also differentiating from a technology perspective. We're designing new products and services specifically for mobile channels, including our app for business owners, which has seen 20% growth in subscribers each month since it launched. Additionally, we have a number of exciting product launches planned for 2015. \r\nThis is not new to us. We've been investing heavily in technology for the past 5 or 6 years. We recently put in a new mortgage system, a new data center, and we've invested in our commercial lending systems. These costs are already built into our run rate. We've remained vigilant about managing expenses to deliver positive operating leverage. And we continue to drive our efficiency ratio even lower, and I believe we can do more to further improve our productivity. Overall, I feel good about the business. We've delivered strong results, and our customer satisfaction ratings continue to climb to new highs. \r\nComing to the Caribbean. We've made significant progress repositioning our operations, including selling RBC Jamaica, a country where we did not have the scale to compete effectively or meet our hurdles. We are starting to see an improvement in core earnings and in our core operating efficiency as we have a more targeted focus on core markets and clients. We believe that the business will return to profitability next year although ongoing economic headwinds require us to continue to look for ways to strengthen our business for the long term. \r\nTurning to Insurance. We had record earnings in 2014 even with pressure from persistently low interest rates and changes in the regulatory environment. I believe our results highlight the strength of our business model, including pricing and product enhancements we've made in recent years as well as our strong focus on deepening client relationships and driving efficiencies. \r\nOur Wealth Management segment had record earnings, which surpassed $1 billion for the first time and were up 22% from last year. Growth was underpinned by our Global Asset Management and Canadian Wealth Management businesses. \r\nStarting with Global Asset Management. Our results reflect the continued leadership in Canada, where we have over 30% market share of long-term funds amongst the Canadian banks. It also reflected our success beyond the Canadian retail market. In fact, today, more than half our assets under management are now from institutional clients. Further, roughly 30% of our institutional assets are from outside of Canada. This is largely due to BlueBay's growth since acquisition, our expanded institutional sales teams in the U.S. and international markets as well as team hires to enhance our investment capabilities, including in global equities. \r\nTurning to our wealth businesses. In Canada, our franchise is exceptionally strong, with Dominion Securities remaining the #1 bank-owned brokerage firm. We've continue to grow our share of the high net worth market, and we consistently deliver industry-leading profits and margins. In U.S. wealth, we've improved profitability by increasing fee-based revenue, and we've continued to develop tools to improve adviser productivity. \r\nIn international wealth, we recently decided to realign and restructure the business with the goal of serving high and ultra high net worth clients from centers where we have scale. I would point out that none of these changes impact our Canadian and U.S. domestic wealth businesses or our Global Asset Management business. While these changes impact a small component of our overall wealth segment, representing less than 5% of revenue and a much lower percentage of earnings, I want to take a moment to explain the key changes. \r\nWe are exiting all of our international private banking businesses in the U.S. and Canada except for our Vancouver office, which we continue to serve -- where we'll continue to serve our Asian client base. We are also exiting our wealth operations in the Caribbean except for investment advisory business. This is separate from our banking business, which, as I explained earlier, we are working hard to strengthen. There were restructuring costs associated with these changes this quarter, but they were not material for the segment. While the restructuring will take some time, over the long term, it will allow us to provide more value to our clients by serving them from key markets where we can better leverage the capabilities and infrastructure of other RBC businesses. \r\nMoving to Investor & Treasury Services. Our results this year demonstrate strong earnings growth and progress from our efficiency management program. After 2 years of extensive restructuring, we're moving to a more client- and market-focused strategy centered on continuing to lead in Canada and maintaining our momentum in Luxembourg and Ireland, where we have a strong presence. We've successfully grown deposits by over 20% since 2012, which helps support RBC's overall balance sheet. \r\nTurning to Capital Markets. We had a record year with earnings exceeding $2 billion, and our results are a testament to the strong client franchise we've built. We have maintained our lead in Canada, and we've solidified our franchise in the U.S. by continuing to build on our investment banking capabilities, developing new lending relationships and doing more business with our existing clients. We are optimistic about the prospects for investment banking in a strong economic environment. \r\nIn the U.K. and Europe, notwithstanding a more challenging business environment, we continue to grow our corporate investment banking businesses by developing strong client relationships and by selectively adding talent to expand our capabilities. For example, we recently recruited 3 new industry heads for industrials, consumer and health care sectors. Europe continues to be a challenging market, and we are being cautious with our build-out. But I am encouraged by the teams we've added and some of the mandates that we've won. \r\nTurning to our fourth quarter. We ended the year on a strong note with earnings of $2.3 billion, up 11% from last year, reflecting record earnings in Canadian Banking and Insurance and strong growth in Investor & Treasury Services and Wealth Management. Capital Market results were impacted by a few items which Janice will expand upon as well as market volatility in September and October. However, I do want to highlight the business' results for the year, with earnings up over 20% and continued growth and improvement in the U.S. and Europe. Overall, I am pleased with the quarter, which caps off a record year and reflects our ongoing focus on developing and deepening client relationships. \r\nI will now turn it over to Janice to provide more details on the fourth quarter. And following her comments and Mark's, I will provide some thoughts on our outlook.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Dave, and good morning. Turning to Slide 9. In our fourth quarter, we earned over $2.3 billion, up $232 million or 11% from last year. Earnings were down $45 million or 2% from last quarter as solid revenue growth in our retail businesses was more than offset by lower results in Capital Markets, which I will expand on in a moment. \r\nStarting with capital. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased 40 basis points from last quarter to 9.9%. The increase reflects strong internal capital generation and lower risk-weighted assets related to our exit of certain proprietary trading strategies, which reduced RWA by $6 billion, particularly -- partially offset by business growth in Capital Markets and Canadian Banking. Overall, we're comfortable with our capital position, which remains very strong.\r\nLet me review the performance of our business segments. Personal & Commercial Banking earned over $1.1 billion, up $81 million or 8% from last year and up $13 million or 1% from last quarter. Canadian Banking reported record earnings of over $1.2 billion, up $123 million or 11% from last year. This reflects strong growth in fee-based revenue of 14%, mainly from higher mutual fund distribution and credit card fees, as well as solid volume growth of 5%. Sequentially, Canadian Banking earnings were up $25 million or 2%. \r\nThis quarter, our earnings were favorably impacted by net cumulative accounting adjustments of $55 million or $40 million after tax, largely reflecting a change in how we account for certain loan fees in our business portfolio. This quarter, our net interest margin was 2.66%, down 7 basis points sequentially. We had a 3-basis-point decline from accounting adjustments, which are not expected to recur. \r\nAnother 3 basis points of the decline was from the change in how we account for certain business loan fees. These fees were previously deferred and amortized over the term of the loan in net interest income. Effective this quarter, they are being recognized as received in other income. This not only impacted our margins this quarter but will continue to have an impact going forward. As an aside, as you have seen on Slide 32, the increase in other income is higher this quarter as it includes this catch-up. \r\nTurning to expenses. Costs in Canadian Banking were elevated this quarter largely due to higher marketing spend as well as higher infrastructure costs in support of business growth, but we delivered positive operating leverage. We continue to target operating leverage in the 1% to 2% range and drive our efficiency ratio to the low 40s. \r\nTurning to Caribbean and U.S. Banking. Our results this quarter reflect higher PCL in the Caribbean, which Mark will discuss in more detail, as well as the restructuring charge to reposition our operations. \r\nTurning to Slide 12. Wealth Management had earnings of $285 million, up $83 million or 41% from last year. This reflects higher revenue from growth in average fee-based client assets in our Global Asset Management group and Canadian Wealth Management businesses, reflecting capital appreciation as well as strong net sales. Also, we had PCL on a few accounts last year but none this quarter. \r\nSequentially, our net income was flat. Our results this quarter also reflect restructuring costs of $18 million after tax related to the repositioning of our U.S. and international wealth businesses, which Dave discussed. Overall, Wealth Management businesses remained strong. Assets under management and assets under administration were up 17% and 12%, respectively, over last year. Our pretax margins continue to improve, and this is our third consecutive quarter with positive operating leverage.\r\nMoving to Insurance on Slide 13. Net income of $256 million was up $149 million from last year. Excluding the prior year charge of $118 million after tax related to the new tax legislation in Canada, net income was up $31 million or 14%. Sequentially, net income increased $42 million or 20%. This quarter, we benefited from lower net claims costs, including a favorable cumulative adjustment related to outstanding claims in our life retrocession business as well as earnings from a new U.K. annuity contract. \r\nInvestor & Treasury Services had strong results with earnings of $113 million, up $22 million or 24% from last year. These results largely reflect higher net interest income on our growth in client deposits, continuing benefits from our efficiency management activities and higher foreign exchange revenue. Sequentially, net income was relatively flat.\r\nTurning to Capital Markets. This quarter, net income was $402 million, down $67 million or 14% from last year and down $239 million or 37% from last quarter. I would remind you that last quarter was exceptionally strong and included about $100 million of revenue from a couple of outsized client transactions. \r\nOur results reflect the challenging market conditions that Dave highlighted as well as 2 specific items. First, we had $105 million pretax or $51 million after-tax charge related to funding valuation adjustments or FVA on uncollateralized over-the-counter derivatives. I would point out that as part of an industry migration to incorporating funding costs into security valuations, we have been recording FVA reserves on all significant trades since the beginning of 2013 and on all new trades since the beginning of this year. The charge we took this quarter represents the impact of FVA on our entire portfolio over and above the reserves we have already taken. It's a onetime catch-up that reflects trades done prior to 2014. \r\nThe second item I'd like to highlight is that we had $75 million or $46 million after tax of lower revenue and costs associated with our exit of certain proprietary trading strategies, which occurred in particularly volatile market conditions. We're well advanced in restructuring our proprietary trading activities in the U.S. to comply with the Volcker rule. We've exited about half the trading strategies. We've transitioned market-making strategies into our agency trading businesses, and we are restructuring our remaining strategies to comply. \r\nWe are actively redeploying capital from the strategies we exited into other businesses. We estimate that the impact of these changes won't be material to our earnings going forward. Factoring these items into our results, we believe Capital Markets had a solid quarter. And while corporate and investment banking was down from a strong quarter and prior year, it continued to perform well. \r\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Mark.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Janice. Good morning, everyone. I could turn you to Slide 17. We continue to see favorable credit trends that remain near historic lows, reflecting our strong risk culture as well as the supportive economic backdrop. \r\nThe Canadian and U.S. economies continue to improve in the fourth quarter, underpinned by strength in the labor market with unemployment rates declining to precrisis levels. Globally, monetary policies remain favorable. Provisions for credit losses on impaired loans this quarter were $345 million or 31 basis points. That's up $62 million or 5 basis points from last quarter, mainly reflecting increased provisions in Caribbean banking and Capital Markets. \r\nIn Caribbean banking, provisions were $77 million, of which $50 million was related to our impaired residential mortgage portfolio. This additional provision reflects our experience with the ongoing challenging economic environment in the region. This was partly offset by provisions in our commercial and retail portfolios. \r\nWith respect to Capital Markets, this quarter, we had provisions of $32 million related to a single account which was newly impaired this quarter, but not reflective of any overall credit deterioration. The Capital Markets loan book continues to perform well, and we ended the year with a provision for credit loss ratio of 7 basis points, the lowest level since 2011. \r\nProvisions in Canadian Banking were $236 million or 27 basis points and remain near historic lows. We were up slightly by $6 million or 1 basis point from last quarter, driven by higher provisions in residential mortgages and business, mostly offset by lower credit card write-offs and lower provisions in our personal lending portfolio. \r\nTurning to Slide 18, which focuses on our Canadian Banking retail portfolio. The credit card provisions remained near historic lows at 231 basis points, down 15 basis points sequentially, largely driven by seasonal factors, in line with last year. The portfolio continued to perform well with low write-offs and strong recoveries. The credit card delinquency rates remained low during the quarter, and we regularly monitor these rates as part of our early warning signals. \r\nOur small business portfolio increased to 2 -- to 92 basis points, up 16 basis points from last quarter, although last quarter marked a 7-year low for provisions. The increase this quarter was largely due to higher net write-offs. \r\nOur residential mortgage portfolio, which is well diversified across Canada, as highlighted on Slide 19, makes up 64% of our retail portfolio. It continues to perform well with provisions this quarter of 2 basis points, consistent with our historical performance. Looking forward, our view remains that the Canadian housing market is moving towards a better balance of supply and demand. Generally speaking, we are seeing Canadians display greater fiscal conservatism by increasing their down payments and accelerating their mortgage repayments. \r\nAdditionally, clients are opting for fixed-rate mortgages, which now make up 75% of our book, up from 73% at the end of 2013, and the average amortization at origination has declined. Across our entire portfolio, we continue to actively monitor our portfolio for early warning signs of credit deterioration and perform ongoing stress testing for numerous scenarios, including increases in unemployment and interest rates, a downturn in the real estate market and given current market conditions, the price of oil. At this time, we are comfortable with our stress test results. We do not see signs of deterioration, and the overall credit quality of our retail portfolios remain strong. \r\nOn Slide 20, gross impaired loans amounted to about $2 billion this quarter and were relatively flat from the third quarter. New impaired formations were relatively stable for the quarter, amounting to $326 million and included one newly impaired loan in Capital Markets for $33 million, which was fully provisioned for in the quarter and written off. \r\nTurning to Slide 21. In the fourth quarter, average market risk VaR, value at risk, was $26 million, unchanged from the previous quarter. The fourth quarter average market risk stress VaR was $78 million, down $9 million or 10% from last quarter, reflecting the exit of certain proprietary trading strategies in the fourth quarter referenced earlier. \r\nWe did have 10 days of net trading losses totaling $46 million, which was highly unusual and largely reflects the fact that we exited certain proprietary strategies during a period of increased market volatility in October. Market volatility also negatively impacted our fixed income trading businesses. We have returned to more normal results in November. We monitor the market risk positions we undertake on a daily basis and are comfortable with our market risk controls. \r\nWith that, I will turn the presentation back to Dave for closing remarks.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Mark, and before I open up to Q&A, let me comment briefly on our outlook and why I'm confident RBC is well positioned to serve our clients going forward. In Canada, we expect the economy to grow modestly next year, driven largely by a pickup in business investment, continued export growth and steady consumer spending. We also expect the market to remain competitive and low interest rates to continue to be a headwind. \r\nWithin this context, let me highlight a couple of areas where we see opportunities for growth. First, investment and savings products are forecasted to grow 3x faster than credit over the next decade. With the most extensive financial planning platform, including the largest mutual fund provider and the largest full-service Wealth Management business, we are well positioned to capture a disproportionate share of market growth. \r\nSecond, over 45% of businesses are expected to change ownership in the next 5 to 10 years. And with our market-leading capabilities, we are well positioned to help business owners plan their succession by finding a buyer for their business, financing the transaction and helping them manage their new wealth. Third, we believe we can continue to extend our lead across all our domestic businesses by deepening client relationships through our proven ability to cross-sell more effectively than our peers. \r\nTurning to the U.S. We expect the economy to outperform next year, which would benefit our businesses as RBC currently generates approximately 20% of revenue serving 2 very attractive client segments: institutional and affluent high net worth. \r\nWithin Capital Markets, our -- the U.S. business now accounts for more than 50% of the segment's revenue or approximately $4.1 billion. For the past 5 years, this business has made considerable investments in people and infrastructure and expanded its corporate client relationships substantially by providing credit. Following a number of years of investment, we are now focused on strengthening returns by doing more business with clients, winning new mandates and driving greater efficiencies. U.S. wealth will continue to drive productivity, and we'll look to enhance its capabilities to provide additional credit and deposit solutions to its clients. \r\nTurning to the U.K. and Europe. Although we expect conditions to improve as stimulus measures take hold, we believe economic growth will continue to be relatively slow. Within this context, we will selectively expand our investment banking sector and geographic coverage, and we'll continue to prudently extend our loan book where it makes sense to help drive new origination. \r\nIn Global Asset Management, we will focus on growing select international investment strategies, including global equity and alternative assets, extending our reach to more institutional investors in the U.S. and select global markets. Across all of our businesses, we will continue to strengthen customer relationships, manage costs and leverage investments in technology to drive efficiencies and enhance the client experience. \r\nTo conclude, I believe that RBC is well positioned to manage through industry headwinds and capitalize on the opportunities created by the changing environment. I'm confident that we'll continue deliver long-term value to shareholders given the strength of our diversified business model, our strong capital base and importantly, our clear strategy for building long-term sustainable client franchises. \r\nWith that, let me open it up for Q&A.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Amy Cairncross (Executives)】\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us.

Actual results could differ materially from these statements.\r\nI will now turn the call over to Dave McKay.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: David McKay (Executives)】\nThank you, Amy. And good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. It was a record year for RBC with record results in all of our business segments, reflecting the strength of our client-focused strategy. We met or exceeded all of our financial performance objectives. We earned $9 billion, up 8% from last year. We delivered a return on equity of 19%, holding higher capital, and we increased our dividend 12%, all of which helped drive strong share -- total shareholder returns. \r\nLet me start by sharing my perspective on the year. Beginning with Canadian Banking. We had record earnings, up 7% from last year, reflecting solid volume growth, strong fee-based revenue and market share gains across nearly all of our businesses. Overall, I believe these results demonstrate the ability of our franchise to adapt to the forces of change in our business and to shift from consumer borrowing to savings and investments with changing client preferences driven by technology. \r\nAs expected, we saw consumer lending moderate following many years of strong credit growth, but we've been planning for this shift for some time. In fact, we spent the last decade enhancing our suite of savings and investment solutions and increasing the number of investment professionals. We believe our approach is working. Over the last year, we achieved double-digit growth in mutual fund revenue and 6% growth in deposits, including 12% growth in core checking balances. \r\nTurning to our business clients. This year, we saw an increase in activity, in particular in the small business segment where RBC is a leader with over 30% market share. This is an important segment for us as we not only serve the needs of the business, we also provide advice and services to the business owner. Additionally, small business clients are a source of deposits and often grow into commercial accounts over time. \r\nThis is a competitive market. To differentiate our offering, we are leveraging our scale to create specialized industry verticals, which enable our account managers to provide targeted solutions. We're also differentiating from a technology perspective. We're designing new products and services specifically for mobile channels, including our app for business owners, which has seen 20% growth in subscribers each month since it launched. Additionally, we have a number of exciting product launches planned for 2015. \r\nThis is not new to us. We've been investing heavily in technology for the past 5 or 6 years. We recently put in a new mortgage system, a new data center, and we've invested in our commercial lending systems. These costs are already built into our run rate. We've remained vigilant about managing expenses to deliver positive operating leverage. And we continue to drive our efficiency ratio even lower, and I believe we can do more to further improve our productivity. Overall, I feel good about the business. We've delivered strong results, and our customer satisfaction ratings continue to climb to new highs. \r\nComing to the Caribbean. We've made significant progress repositioning our operations, including selling RBC Jamaica, a country where we did not have the scale to compete effectively or meet our hurdles. We are starting to see an improvement in core earnings and in our core operating efficiency as we have a more targeted focus on core markets and clients. We believe that the business will return to profitability next year although ongoing economic headwinds require us to continue to look for ways to strengthen our business for the long term. \r\nTurning to Insurance. We had record earnings in 2014 even with pressure from persistently low interest rates and changes in the regulatory environment. I believe our results highlight the strength of our business model, including pricing and product enhancements we've made in recent years as well as our strong focus on deepening client relationships and driving efficiencies. \r\nOur Wealth Management segment had record earnings, which surpassed $1 billion for the first time and were up 22% from last year. Growth was underpinned by our Global Asset Management and Canadian Wealth Management businesses. \r\nStarting with Global Asset Management. Our results reflect the continued leadership in Canada, where we have over 30% market share of long-term funds amongst the Canadian banks. It also reflected our success beyond the Canadian retail market. In fact, today, more than half our assets under management are now from institutional clients. Further, roughly 30% of our institutional assets are from outside of Canada. This is largely due to BlueBay's growth since acquisition, our expanded institutional sales teams in the U.S. and international markets as well as team hires to enhance our investment capabilities, including in global equities. \r\nTurning to our wealth businesses. In Canada, our franchise is exceptionally strong, with Dominion Securities remaining the #1 bank-owned brokerage firm. We've continue to grow our share of the high net worth market, and we consistently deliver industry-leading profits and margins. In U.S. wealth, we've improved profitability by increasing fee-based revenue, and we've continued to develop tools to improve adviser productivity. \r\nIn international wealth, we recently decided to realign and restructure the business with the goal of serving high and ultra high net worth clients from centers where we have scale. I would point out that none of these changes impact our Canadian and U.S. domestic wealth businesses or our Global Asset Management business. While these changes impact a small component of our overall wealth segment, representing less than 5% of revenue and a much lower percentage of earnings, I want to take a moment to explain the key changes. \r\nWe are exiting all of our international private banking businesses in the U.S. and Canada except for our Vancouver office, which we continue to serve -- where we'll continue to serve our Asian client base. We are also exiting our wealth operations in the Caribbean except for investment advisory business. This is separate from our banking business, which, as I explained earlier, we are working hard to strengthen. There were restructuring costs associated with these changes this quarter, but they were not material for the segment. While the restructuring will take some time, over the long term, it will allow us to provide more value to our clients by serving them from key markets where we can better leverage the capabilities and infrastructure of other RBC businesses. \r\nMoving to Investor & Treasury Services. Our results this year demonstrate strong earnings growth and progress from our efficiency management program. After 2 years of extensive restructuring, we're moving to a more client- and market-focused strategy centered on continuing to lead in Canada and maintaining our momentum in Luxembourg and Ireland, where we have a strong presence. We've successfully grown deposits by over 20% since 2012, which helps support RBC's overall balance sheet. \r\nTurning to Capital Markets. We had a record year with earnings exceeding $2 billion, and our results are a testament to the strong client franchise we've built. We have maintained our lead in Canada, and we've solidified our franchise in the U.S. by continuing to build on our investment banking capabilities, developing new lending relationships and doing more business with our existing clients. We are optimistic about the prospects for investment banking in a strong economic environment. \r\nIn the U.K. and Europe, notwithstanding a more challenging business environment, we continue to grow our corporate investment banking businesses by developing strong client relationships and by selectively adding talent to expand our capabilities. For example, we recently recruited 3 new industry heads for industrials, consumer and health care sectors. Europe continues to be a challenging market, and we are being cautious with our build-out. But I am encouraged by the teams we've added and some of the mandates that we've won. \r\nTurning to our fourth quarter. We ended the year on a strong note with earnings of $2.3 billion, up 11% from last year, reflecting record earnings in Canadian Banking and Insurance and strong growth in Investor & Treasury Services and Wealth Management. Capital Market results were impacted by a few items which Janice will expand upon as well as market volatility in September and October. However, I do want to highlight the business' results for the year, with earnings up over 20% and continued growth and improvement in the U.S. and Europe. Overall, I am pleased with the quarter, which caps off a record year and reflects our ongoing focus on developing and deepening client relationships. \r\nI will now turn it over to Janice to provide more details on the fourth quarter. And following her comments and Mark's, I will provide some thoughts on our outlook.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Janice Fukakusa (Executives)】\nThanks, Dave, and good morning. Turning to Slide 9. In our fourth quarter, we earned over $2.3 billion, up $232 million or 11% from last year. Earnings were down $45 million or 2% from last quarter as solid revenue growth in our retail businesses was more than offset by lower results in Capital Markets, which I will expand on in a moment. \r\nStarting with capital. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased 40 basis points from last quarter to 9.9%. The increase reflects strong internal capital generation and lower risk-weighted assets related to our exit of certain proprietary trading strategies, which reduced RWA by $6 billion, particularly -- partially offset by business growth in Capital Markets and Canadian Banking. Overall, we're comfortable with our capital position, which remains very strong.\r\nLet me review the performance of our business segments. Personal & Commercial Banking earned over $1.1 billion, up $81 million or 8% from last year and up $13 million or 1% from last quarter. Canadian Banking reported record earnings of over $1.2 billion, up $123 million or 11% from last year. This reflects strong growth in fee-based revenue of 14%, mainly from higher mutual fund distribution and credit card fees, as well as solid volume growth of 5%. Sequentially, Canadian Banking earnings were up $25 million or 2%. \r\nThis quarter, our earnings were favorably impacted by net cumulative accounting adjustments of $55 million or $40 million after tax, largely reflecting a change in how we account for certain loan fees in our business portfolio. This quarter, our net interest margin was 2.66%, down 7 basis points sequentially. We had a 3-basis-point decline from accounting adjustments, which are not expected to recur. \r\nAnother 3 basis points of the decline was from the change in how we account for certain business loan fees. These fees were previously deferred and amortized over the term of the loan in net interest income. Effective this quarter, they are being recognized as received in other income. This not only impacted our margins this quarter but will continue to have an impact going forward. As an aside, as you have seen on Slide 32, the increase in other income is higher this quarter as it includes this catch-up. \r\nTurning to expenses. Costs in Canadian Banking were elevated this quarter largely due to higher marketing spend as well as higher infrastructure costs in support of business growth, but we delivered positive operating leverage. We continue to target operating leverage in the 1% to 2% range and drive our efficiency ratio to the low 40s. \r\nTurning to Caribbean and U.S. Banking. Our results this quarter reflect higher PCL in the Caribbean, which Mark will discuss in more detail, as well as the restructuring charge to reposition our operations. \r\nTurning to Slide 12. Wealth Management had earnings of $285 million, up $83 million or 41% from last year. This reflects higher revenue from growth in average fee-based client assets in our Global Asset Management group and Canadian Wealth Management businesses, reflecting capital appreciation as well as strong net sales. Also, we had PCL on a few accounts last year but none this quarter. \r\nSequentially, our net income was flat. Our results this quarter also reflect restructuring costs of $18 million after tax related to the repositioning of our U.S. and international wealth businesses, which Dave discussed. Overall, Wealth Management businesses remained strong. Assets under management and assets under administration were up 17% and 12%, respectively, over last year. Our pretax margins continue to improve, and this is our third consecutive quarter with positive operating leverage.\r\nMoving to Insurance on Slide 13. Net income of $256 million was up $149 million from last year. Excluding the prior year charge of $118 million after tax related to the new tax legislation in Canada, net income was up $31 million or 14%. Sequentially, net income increased $42 million or 20%. This quarter, we benefited from lower net claims costs, including a favorable cumulative adjustment related to outstanding claims in our life retrocession business as well as earnings from a new U.K. annuity contract. \r\nInvestor & Treasury Services had strong results with earnings of $113 million, up $22 million or 24% from last year. These results largely reflect higher net interest income on our growth in client deposits, continuing benefits from our efficiency management activities and higher foreign exchange revenue. Sequentially, net income was relatively flat.\r\nTurning to Capital Markets. This quarter, net income was $402 million, down $67 million or 14% from last year and down $239 million or 37% from last quarter. I would remind you that last quarter was exceptionally strong and included about $100 million of revenue from a couple of outsized client transactions. \r\nOur results reflect the challenging market conditions that Dave highlighted as well as 2 specific items. First, we had $105 million pretax or $51 million after-tax charge related to funding valuation adjustments or FVA on uncollateralized over-the-counter derivatives. I would point out that as part of an industry migration to incorporating funding costs into security valuations, we have been recording FVA reserves on all significant trades since the beginning of 2013 and on all new trades since the beginning of this year. The charge we took this quarter represents the impact of FVA on our entire portfolio over and above the reserves we have already taken. It's a onetime catch-up that reflects trades done prior to 2014. \r\nThe second item I'd like to highlight is that we had $75 million or $46 million after tax of lower revenue and costs associated with our exit of certain proprietary trading strategies, which occurred in particularly volatile market conditions. We're well advanced in restructuring our proprietary trading activities in the U.S. to comply with the Volcker rule. We've exited about half the trading strategies. We've transitioned market-making strategies into our agency trading businesses, and we are restructuring our remaining strategies to comply. \r\nWe are actively redeploying capital from the strategies we exited into other businesses. We estimate that the impact of these changes won't be material to our earnings going forward. Factoring these items into our results, we believe Capital Markets had a solid quarter. And while corporate and investment banking was down from a strong quarter and prior year, it continued to perform well. \r\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Mark.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Mark Hughes (Executives)】\nThank you, Janice. Good morning, everyone. I could turn you to Slide 17. We continue to see favorable credit trends that remain near historic lows, reflecting our strong risk culture as well as the supportive economic backdrop. \r\nThe Canadian and U.S. economies continue to improve in the fourth quarter, underpinned by strength in the labor market with unemployment rates declining to precrisis levels. Globally, monetary policies remain favorable. Provisions for credit losses on impaired loans this quarter were $345 million or 31 basis points.

In the fourth quarter, average market risk VaR, value at risk, was $26 million, unchanged from the previous quarter. The fourth quarter average market risk stress VaR was $78 million, down $9 million or 10% from last quarter, reflecting the exit of certain proprietary trading strategies in the fourth quarter referenced earlier. \r\nWe did have 10 days of net trading losses totaling $46 million, which was highly unusual and largely reflects the fact that we exited certain proprietary strategies during a period of increased market volatility in October. Market volatility also negatively impacted our fixed income trading businesses. We have returned to more normal results in November. We monitor the market risk positions we undertake on a daily basis and are comfortable with our market risk controls. \r\nWith that, I will turn the presentation back to Dave for closing remarks.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: David McKay (Executives)】\nThank you, Mark, and before I open up to Q&A, let me comment briefly on our outlook and why I'm confident RBC is well positioned to serve our clients going forward.

I'm confident that we'll continue deliver long-term value to shareholders given the strength of our diversified business model, our strong capital base and importantly, our clear strategy for building long-term sustainable client franchises. \r\nWith that, let me open it up for Q&A.",
      "transcript_text3": "Janice, I was hoping that we could revisit the charges taken on the prop as to -- because of the Volcker Rule. The $75 million, can you let us know how much of that actually related to charges for exiting the position and if any of that amount actually related to run-rate earnings that were previously embedded?\n\n---\n\nI think that we haven't bifurcated the amount that we would have taken in terms of the timing of the position going down. But if you look at the net result of the charges that we sized, the $75 million, that would be mostly onetime costs and some losses on trading positions. So on a go-forward basis, we still have effective strategies, and we said that we don't think it will impact us materially going forward. Doug, would you like to say something?\n\n---\n\nIn particular, we were exiting -- what we determined was we are going to exit about half the strategies we've been running for more than a decade. And in particular, we have credit opportunities or credit strategy which really revolves around corporate credit, and what we found was we determined -- well, we wanted to exit by year-end. And I think, as you know, credit backed up and rates were pretty volatile as well through the month of October. So the bulk of the loss was in selling credit books, which we have sold. So we have -- of the strategies we exited, we have sold about 99% of the assets. There's 1 or 2 remaining.\n\n---\n\nAnd when we talk about half of the positions, presumably then the other half are the ones that are being transitioned into other areas or being made Volcker compliant?\n\n---\n\nYes. So we've transferred -- some of the businesses meet the market-making exemption, and so we have transferred those businesses into our cash equities and our securities funding business. And we're just repositioning the remainder.\n\n---\n\nJust a follow-up on that topic. So you mentioned that half of the strategies have exited. I'm trying to tie that into some of the historical guidance that you've given that prop trading overall was about 2% to 3% of total bank revenues. So should we assume then that half of that amount is gone and over time, you're going to replace it? And that what's going to happen to the other half?\n\n---\n\nWell, as I just said, the remaining strategies will be Volcker compliant or we wouldn't have kept them. And I would say that between redeploying the capital that we've just recovered from exiting certain strategies and what we have left on, I think Janice said in her remarks, is there wouldn't be a material change in our run rate, which is what we believe.\n\n---\n\nOkay. So there should be no -- like, the way I kind of understood it was that over -- you would take a short-term reduction in your revenues, but that -- as you redeploy the capital, that you would replace it but that takes a little bit of time. Or have you already effectively deployed that capital?\n\n---\n\nYes. I mean, I suppose it's possible that during the quarter that might occur. I would say, so far, the returns from what we've retained have been certainly satisfactory, and we have put out a reasonable amount of the capital we recovered. So could it be a bit softer by the end of the quarter? I guess that's possible, but so far, so good.\n\n---\n\nOkay. My next question's for either Dave or Jennifer on the Canadian P&C business. Good quarter there, good loan growth. Just wondering about the outlook for operating leverage in 2015. And then some of the comments you've made recently kind of backing off a bit of that industry growth plus 25%. What does that say about your expense management strategy next year? I know in previous periods, '08, '09, for example, when the going got tough, you did really pull back on expenses. Should we expect that next year? Because this year, for Royal and other banks, there's been quite a bit of expense inflation.\n\n---\n\nThanks very much, Gabriel. I'll first start by saying we're pleased with our record quarter. And going forward, we -- as we invest in  -- continue to invest in the business, we're still targeting operating leverage of 1% to 2% and continuing to drive our efficiency ratio to the low 40s. As far as overall expense management, it continues to be a focus for all of the Canadian banks because we want to continue to invest in our business. And as far as our premium, we have come off somewhat as the overall industry volumes have declined, but we're continuing to see market share gains across all our businesses, as Dave said. And we're also maintaining, as Mark said, our strong credit performance, a very good margin and industry-leading efficiency ratio. So going forward, we remain committed to growing at a premium, and we're seeing good momentum in a few areas. For example, as Dave highlighted, we're very well positioned to capture a disproportionate share of the deposit and investment growth. And in fact, our market share has grown over 80 basis points over the past 2 years. And in mutual fund business, we have in excess of 30% share of all mutual funds sold. So we think that, that part of our business is going to continue to have great momentum, and in addition, we're pleased with improved momentum in our business -- lending business this quarter.\n\n---\n\nMy question is for Doug. Doug, I was thinking about the weakness in oil pricing. Can you comment on what you think about the contribution that sector has done for Capital Markets revenues for this year? And is there any expectation of some weakness going forward in volumes related to the weakness in oil?\n\n---\n\nYes. From the slides in the deck, you can see that energy is about 15% of our loans. So there's some revenues associated with that. In terms of the overall Capital Markets revenues, I mean, it varies, but it's between 5% and 10%. Energy is an important business for us both in Houston and Calgary. The run rate in the business has been pretty good recently, frankly, and whether lower energy prices will slow that or not, we'll just have to wait and see.\n\n---\n\nSo let me just clarify, I guess. So when you said 15% of loans, 15% of your Capital Markets loans, the 100 -- or the 68, 69?\n\n---\n\nThat's correct. I think that the slide shows, I think, the loan's about $61 billion, and I think it shows us at -- what percent?\n\n---\n\nAbout 12% to 13%.\n\n---\n\nAbout 12% to 13%.\n\n---\n\nFor oil and gas. And energy in total, including mining, would be 15%.\n\n---\n\nRight. And so the energy business includes the pipelines as well as the exploration companies. And the pipelines, the CapEx that they have been spending, and they've been a big contributor to our revenues, I don't see that slowing in the near term.\n\n---\n\nOkay. So -- and I guess, maybe as a follow-up, and maybe this is related to Mark. The Capital Markets, the GIL formation this quarter, there was 1 company. Was -- can you comment whether or not that was in the energy or mining and metals sector?\n\n---\n\nAs it turns out, it was actually in the energy sector, but I would say that it was completely unrelated to the oil price or the energy prices moving up and down. It was actually a fire at the facility itself, so totally unrelated to where the commodity prices are. And just to add a bit more on the percentages, it's -- for oil and gas, it's around 12% of -- 12% to 13% of the corporate banking Capital Markets book. In terms of the overall bank credit book, it's around 2% to 3%. So obviously, it's how you look at the numbers.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then maybe just, while you're on it, and then I'll get back in the queue, if you can just comment how much of that energy portfolio is E&P reserve based versus suppliers, which is a little bit more risky.\n\n---\n\nWe have about half -- or just over half of the numbers that I've been quoting is in E&P. And about 13% of it would be in the drilling and services business, which, in my mind, is where the risk will start to take in effect first as and when the E&P firms start to cut back or if they do cut back on CapEx.\n\n---\n\nJust the first question is on the Caribbean. And David, you made a comment in your prepared remarks that you're comfortable that it's going to return to profitability next year. I'm just trying to get some detail around where that comfort comes from. And within the Caribbean, obviously, you've made it -- you have RBTT. Just wondering how comfortable you are with the carrying value of that investment. And then I wanted to -- third part of this is I just wanted to clarify. There was a $17 million restructuring charge in the Caribbean, Janice, I think. Is that independent of $18 million that was related to the wealth?\n\n---\n\nYes. I'll make -- I'll cover the first part of that question, Doug, and then Janice will talk to the carrying value of the Caribbean bank. We've done a lot of work in the Caribbean in restructuring operations, focusing on core markets and core clients. You saw us, this year, exit RBC Jamaica, which was a significant decision for us along that line. As we look at our core operating earnings in the business, they've been improving quarter by quarter by quarter to a point where we did take some onetime credit charges this quarter, particularly in our mortgage book, as Mark referenced. But as we look forward we expect that core operating strength to emerge next year. And we're confident -- albeit the economy is tough, but we look at our revenue run rates, we look at our expense control and the repositioning of our cost base in the Caribbean and we're confident we'll return to profitability next year.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And Doug, it's Janice. I'll answer the question on the carrying value of the investment. We constantly review the Caribbean for any indications of impairment, and we didn't see any. In addition, with respect to this quarter, we performed our annual goodwill testing, and so a lot of the details of the assumptions we made are actually in our disclosure in the consolidated statements, which describe how we've done -- looked at the cash flows and how -- the discount rates that we've used. And so we continue to be comfortable with the carrying value of the investment, and that's why you see that we did not consider any impairment at all. The $17 million charge that's in the Caribbean is totally independent of the international Wealth Management charge, and it relates to our continuing restructuring of the domestic banking businesses down there in an effort to improve efficiency.\n\n---\n\nAnd then if I can -- just need just a clarification. On the Insurance side, I guess for George maybe, was there any benefits that came through from actuarial assumption changes, methodology changes? We know there's some big changes coming through the life co industry, and just wondering if there was any noise in the Insurance results that boosted our earnings this quarter?\n\n---\n\nSure. Doug, I'll take that. The Q4 does tend to be a seasonally strong quarter for us in RBC Insurance because we do conduct our annual review of actuarial assumptions and also, it's typically a lower claims cost quarter as well. But within the annual review of actuarial assumptions, there was no significant impact from the URR change, either positive or negative. So to a large extent, several years ago, we had instituted a program to more closely match our assets and liabilities in Insurance and so -- working with finance and risk management in that respect before interest rates declined. So we did not benefit from the URR formula change to the same extent as some other players.\n\n---\n\nFirst, Janice or whomever, the bank is sticking with the 7% EPS growth target for 2015 and looking forward. First, what base would you say the bank is using, base in terms of EPS for 2014, from which to drive the 7% growth?\n\n---\n\nI think, Mario, I think that by base you mean what is that growth rate keyed off of. And in fact, we're using our actual results in saying that we believe, in our medium-term objective, we can achieve 7% growth in the future going forward from 2014.\n\n---\n\nUsing just...\n\n---\n\nReported.\n\n---\n\nYes, the reported number. And...\n\n---\n\nRight.\n\n---\n\nNow I know they're medium-term objectives. But in each Q4, you do assess the results of that year against those objectives, so they tend to have -- it tends to feel like an annual target as well because of the way you assess those results in the Q4. Is that 7% something you would point us to for 2015 as well?\n\n---\n\nWell, I think it is a medium-term objective, and we've managed to, over the past few years, meet most and this year, all of our medium-term objectives. So I think that our encompassing medium-term objective is to achieve top-performing total shareholder return. And then we encompass the financial metrics in that, and we measure on an annual basis. So I would say that if you look at it, we are not putting out annual guidance, just medium-term objectives, but we have been very successful in meeting them over the past few years.\n\n---\n\nDoes 2015 seem a little more challenging though than in prior years in getting to that 7%?\n\n---\n\nI think -- this is Dave. Based on my comments I made earlier, we see a good Canadian economy with growth across the consumer, commercial and corporate sectors. We see a very strong U.S. economy that will help drive Canada through exports. We've well positioned the U.S. in our Capital Markets business and in our wealth business to capitalize on that growth. So we have a number of ways to grow the organization, in addition to the secular trend of seeing a shift towards deposits and investments. We see a significant opportunity in our franchise to capture core areas of growth in Canada, the U.S. and emerging Europe. So I think you look at our franchise and the diversity -- diversification that we have across our businesses, so we will stand by our medium-term objectives.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then just one final point on energy. So if it's 12% to 13% of the corporate book, it sounds like oil and gas would be something like $7 billion to $7.5 billion. What would be helpful to know is if you could break that down between the reserve-based lending and the covenant or the cash flow lending. Does anyone have that handy?\n\n---\n\nI don't actually have that handy. I would say that a large proportion of our loan book is to investment-grade large corporates, but we do have a sizable amount as well to borrowing basis. We would have to get you back the exact split on how that works.\n\n---\n\nMy question is also dealing with the impact of lower oil prices. But I was wondering about -- as you think through the implications for the Canadian P&C business in particular, I'm wondering -- maybe it's a leading question, but wondering sort of what are the -- are there positive implications from that for Canadian P&C business specifically? And where do you see those impacts hitting?\n\n---\n\nWith respect to positive drivers, being lower gas prices driving consumer spending, which is some of the commentary you see in the United States, I think it'll be modest at the end of the day. Job creation is one of the critical drivers in the economy. Business spending and exports, I think, will be the predominant drivers. We're seeing very strong export growth in the country. We're still waiting to see more private-sector investment in the economy. Those will be the primary drivers, I think, rather than lower gas prices at the pump stimulating consumer spending. It'll be marginal, I would expect.\n\n---\n\nAnd just a follow-up on that. At what point or at what price or what duration do you have to start to reappraise your outlook for 2015 when it comes to oil prices? Wondering if you could add a little bit of insight into that.\n\n---\n\nOn the credit book, are you asking, specifically? Or on the...\n\n---\n\nOn the credit book specifically.\n\n---\n\nI mean, at the moment, we're doing constantly lower oil price sensitivities. We have actually gone, in an overall stress test portfolio, significantly below the current market prices. We're also doing individual name-by-name stresses against where the prices are currently and a little bit below where they are currently. And based on what I am seeing so far, given the expectation for what we have with either hedging in the E&P producers or the amount of credit availability that they still have for liquidity or the ability that they have to cut CapEx, at this point in time, we're not seeing a future deterioration with oil price. Of course, it's always about how long it goes on for. And at the moment, we are stressing out 1 year, 2 years, and we still, at this point, remain seeing things within our overall risk appetite.\n\n---\n\nI'll pick up from that last question. On Page 19, you gave us the geographic diversification of your mortgage book. It looks like 34% of your mortgages are in BC and Alberta. Is your -- do you have the same basic geographic mix for your unsecured household lending?\n\n---\n\nI don't know if we have that right at hand here. We can get back to you. But our credit strategies wouldn't change, secured or unsecured, against that region. We have a client strategy at the end of the day in the credit side, so I would expect to see an equal distribution, in that our strategies don't change in secured and unsecured, would be my answer. Mark, do you have anything to add to that?\n\n---\n\nI think that would be exactly how I would answer. I don't have the specific number to hand, which we can get you. But certainly, my understanding of our strategies and how we're managing is consistent across the country, not geographic. I would also add, as -- on this oil price point, I mean, we've talked a lot more about on the corporate type and the commercial type of exposures. We are looking also on the retail side. We are able to monitor at even a community-type basis where our exposures are. So far, we have not seen outstandings or delinquencies increase in, say, the Alberta region. But that is part of our early warning signal approach. So we are monitoring that as well. I think what I would say, from a risk perspective, is until you really see unemployment hit caused by some form of lower CapEx or lower spending by the corporate side of the E&P side, you will not see that dramatic an impact or negative impact on the retail books. I think you'll see, initially, a positive impact. They'll have more cash flow, better gas prices and all of that. And the negative impact would be if people start to be unemployed as the industry cuts back, which, at this point, we have not seen happen.\n\n---\n\nDo you have any sense of how your PCLs might look a year from today if oil is still at $65 or in and around the range? PCLs from Canada I mean, specifically.\n\n---\n\nYes. At this point, they would still be within the range of our normal expectations.\n\n---\n\nRight.\n\n---\n\nThis is a slow issue?\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nDave, just a question for you on capital. I see your CET1 is about 9.9%. So it feels like the industry is trending toward 10%. In your view, what's the likelihood it goes above that? Or are we finally going to stop at 10%? And then -- well, I'll leave that question. I have a follow-up.\n\n---\n\nI think, as you've heard us comment on quarter-to-quarter, we're targeting 9.5% plus a buffer. So you're seeing us trend into that range right now at 9.9%, a little bit higher than our buffer. And I think we see good  opportunity to deploy capital into organic growth next year, and we see growth in our lending book in Canada and the U.S. So I think that is obviously a factor. And we have overall capital deployment opportunities. We've renewed our share buyback of 12 million shares, and we have all the tools available that you expect to manage our capital base, including organic opportunities to deploy capital into growth.\n\n---\n\nSo if you're at a comfortable level, will you start -- restart, I should say, your NCIB this quarter or next quarter?\n\n---\n\nWe're -- Peter, it's Janice. We're always looking at the levels and opportunities to do that, and we did renew the NCIB because it's our intention to use it as an active capital management tool.\n\n---\n\nJanice, just maybe a bit of a difficult question to answer. But if you think about the overall tech spend budget, looking into 2015, how much higher do you think it's going to have to be versus 2014?\n\n---\n\nBecause of the way that we do technology projects in that we have multiyear projects and we're always reinvesting, I would say that our tech spend budget will be very consistent next year to what we have just gone through this year. Because the nature of our programs and our commitment to invest in new technology in terms of simplifying our processes for our clients, innovation, all of that, we don't see any major shift in that. We started with these programs, a lot of them, 2 or 3 years ago, and some of them are midstream. And we continue to invest because we're investing in -- basically, on a medium term to ensure that we are always at the front end of anything happening. I don't see any shift.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And do you see any shift in the mix of that spend between the business segments?\n\n---\n\nNo, we -- I don't see any shift at all in the mix.\n\n---\n\nFirst, for Doug McGregor, the decline in fixed income trading -- I apologize if this is a repeat question, by the way. But the decline in fixed income trading looks to be more than slower client activity, to me, at any rate. So I guess what I'm wondering is were there material mark-to-market losses in the fixed income books through that mid-quarter or that mid-October period of high volatility with spreads widening. Or would you really insist that it was more client activity levels?\n\n---\n\nWell, if you look at the FIC numbers, the headline items, first of all is the FVA. Second, that I described earlier, is that we had a credit opportunity strategy in our proprietary business that we determined to take off, and I think it was a result of -- just marks as a result of illiquidity in early and mid-October. I would say, overall, the rest of the weakness was rates was gapping up and down for the better part of 30 days. And we had, I think if you look in the disclosure, 10 or 11 days of trading losses, and they would have been $5 to $10, but that was a mix of in-GAAP in Europe -- or sorry, in FIC in Europe and the U.S. And I would say our credit books in the U.S. also were just -- we were just marking inventory and trying to provide liquidity to our clients and our customers and it got expensive. So I think as the numbers come out, you will see a trend that it was a difficult trading environment in fixed income.\n\n---\n\nOkay. The credit opportunity strategy you took off, is that Volcker related? Or that was taken off for some other reason?\n\n---\n\nYes, yes. It was part of the proprietary business that, as we said, we've had for a long time, and we didn't see that, anyway, that was going to comply with Volcker longer term. So the strategies that we determined would not comply, we have wound down, and the people have left.\n\n---\n\nOkay, that's helpful. And Janice, just to -- just a point of clarification. Earlier on the call, did you talk about efficiency ratio in Canadian Banking being below 40%, I thought I caught that, relative to the -- what I thought the low 40% target rate?\n\n---\n\nNo. Steve, it was low 40s, consistent with what we've been targeting.\n\n---\n\nA question in relation to the Wealth Management segment and the restructuring as well as the outlook going forward. So if I got your comments correct at the beginning, Dave, I think you said the businesses that you're disposing of are about 5% of revenue, but it sounds like not a very big contribution to earnings. Is that correct?\n\n---\n\nI'll let George maybe comment on that. But yes, that's correct, it's not material.\n\n---\n\nWell -- and before George, I'll just ask. As you think about the wealth segment going forward, are there other areas of the business, particularly outside of Canada, that are under review in terms of the potential restructuring -- or potential attempts of restructuring those as well going forward?\n\n---\n\nSo Sumit, I'll take that. And the -- as Dave commented in his remarks, these restructuring activities in our international wealth business, it does represent a very small component of our wealth segment. And this will not impact our Global Asset Management business, which, to your point, has a very large footprint outside of Canada. It's growing well, positive flows. And it won't affect our Canadian and U.S. wealth domestic businesses either. So stepping back, for context, these international businesses at one point in time, in 2008, 2009, represented about 20% of our segment earnings. They're now close to breakeven as we've invested in strengthening the infrastructure front and middle office during a period of -- extended period of low interest rates. So what we've done is take a look at this, which has negatively impacted our trust and deposit revenues, and decided to narrow our country and client focus and concentrate on serving those international cross-border clients from our key international center in our channels where we do have scale. So that will take some time to implement. We're looking at all strategic options for the various components of the international wealth business, including identifying interested parties to purchase portions of those operations. But this will not impact our large high-performing businesses in Global Asset Management or Canadian wealth or U.S. wealth, which really drove an excellent year for us this year in terms of earnings up 22%.\n\n---\n\nSo George, to wrap it up, I know we've had this discussion a few times over the years. But when you think about the pretax margin in the segment this year just under 24% and specifically against some of the targets that you'd provided in the past that you wanted the segment to get to and taking this first step to reposition the business, where do you think margins of this business improve to? I can probably do some of the math myself, but wanted to get your outlook on what's a more reasonable goal now that you've taken this step on the wealth side.\n\n---\n\nYes, sure. So I think we anticipate continuing to make progress in improving our pretax margin. Our Global Asset Management business, which represents about 60% of our earnings, is a very high-margin business, 50% pretax margins. It's why we are intent on continuing to grow it. Obviously, as we exit lower-margin businesses in international wealth, that's going to naturally improve our pretax margin, which remains our principal goal. I'd also say that looking forward to next year, we're conscious that we've benefited from robust markets in both 2013 and 2014. Our earnings were up 18% last year, 22% this year. And our plan is based on normal markets, and we intend to aim to deliver positive operating leverage in a lower revenue growth environment in 2015, if that comes to pass.\n\n---\n\nSumit, the only comment I would add is you can see a theme across our wealth and Caribbean businesses and even ITS on a focus on core markets, core clients. We understand where the growth is going to come from, and I think it's good discipline for the business to really focus on where -- focus on where that growth's going to come from. So these are important moves for us to manage areas that don't have scale and we don't believe have long-term potential for us.\n\n---\n\nI just wanted to thank everyone for joining us on the call today. And I do wish you happy holidays, and we will see you again in the new year. Thanks very much, everybody.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: John Aiken (Analysts)】\nJanice, I was hoping that we could revisit the charges taken on the prop as to -- because of the Volcker Rule. The $75 million, can you let us know how much of that actually related to charges for exiting the position and if any of that amount actually related to run-rate earnings that were previously embedded?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Janice Fukakusa (Executives)】\nI think that we haven't bifurcated the amount that we would have taken in terms of the timing of the position going down. But if you look at the net result of the charges that we sized, the $75 million, that would be mostly onetime costs and some losses on trading positions. So on a go-forward basis, we still have effective strategies, and we said that we don't think it will impact us materially going forward. Doug, would you like to say something?\n\n---\n\n【回答: A. McGregor (Executives)】\nIn particular, we were exiting -- what we determined was we are going to exit about half the strategies we've been running for more than a decade. And in particular, we have credit opportunities or credit strategy which really revolves around corporate credit, and what we found was we determined -- well, we wanted to exit by year-end. And I think, as you know, credit backed up and rates were pretty volatile as well through the month of October. So the bulk of the loss was in selling credit books, which we have sold. So we have -- of the strategies we exited, we have sold about 99% of the assets. There's 1 or 2 remaining.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Aiken (Analysts)】\nAnd when we talk about half of the positions, presumably then the other half are the ones that are being transitioned into other areas or being made Volcker compliant?\n\n---\n\n【回答: A. McGregor (Executives)】\nYes. So we've transferred -- some of the businesses meet the market-making exemption, and so we have transferred those businesses into our cash equities and our securities funding business. And we're just repositioning the remainder.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gabriel Dechaine (Analysts)】\nJust a follow-up on that topic. So you mentioned that half of the strategies have exited. I'm trying to tie that into some of the historical guidance that you've given that prop trading overall was about 2% to 3% of total bank revenues. So should we assume then that half of that amount is gone and over time, you're going to replace it? And that what's going to happen to the other half?\n\n---\n\n【回答: A. McGregor (Executives)】\nWell, as I just said, the remaining strategies will be Volcker compliant or we wouldn't have kept them. And I would say that between redeploying the capital that we've just recovered from exiting certain strategies and what we have left on, I think Janice said in her remarks, is there wouldn't be a material change in our run rate, which is what we believe.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gabriel Dechaine (Analysts)】\nOkay. So there should be no -- like, the way I kind of understood it was that over -- you would take a short-term reduction in your revenues, but that -- as you redeploy the capital, that you would replace it but that takes a little bit of time. Or have you already effectively deployed that capital?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David McKay (Executives)】\nYes. I mean, I suppose it's possible that during the quarter that might occur. I would say, so far, the returns from what we've retained have been certainly satisfactory, and we have put out a reasonable amount of the capital we recovered. So could it be a bit softer by the end of the quarter? I guess that's possible, but so far, so good.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gabriel Dechaine (Analysts)】\nOkay. My next question's for either Dave or Jennifer on the Canadian P&C business. Good quarter there, good loan growth. Just wondering about the outlook for operating leverage in 2015. And then some of the comments you've made recently kind of backing off a bit of that industry growth plus 25%. What does that say about your expense management strategy next year? I know in previous periods, '08, '09, for example, when the going got tough, you did really pull back on expenses. Should we expect that next year? Because this year, for Royal and other banks, there's been quite a bit of expense inflation.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jennifer Tory (Executives)】\nThanks very much, Gabriel. I'll first start by saying we're pleased with our record quarter. And going forward, we -- as we invest in  -- continue to invest in the business, we're still targeting operating leverage of 1% to 2% and continuing to drive our efficiency ratio to the low 40s. As far as overall expense management, it continues to be a focus for all of the Canadian banks because we want to continue to invest in our business. And as far as our premium, we have come off somewhat as the overall industry volumes have declined, but we're continuing to see market share gains across all our businesses, as Dave said. And we're also maintaining, as Mark said, our strong credit performance, a very good margin and industry-leading efficiency ratio. So going forward, we remain committed to growing at a premium, and we're seeing good momentum in a few areas. For example, as Dave highlighted, we're very well positioned to capture a disproportionate share of the deposit and investment growth. And in fact, our market share has grown over 80 basis points over the past 2 years. And in mutual fund business, we have in excess of 30% share of all mutual funds sold. So we think that, that part of our business is going to continue to have great momentum, and in addition, we're pleased with improved momentum in our business -- lending business this quarter.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Brian Klock (Analysts)】\nMy question is for Doug. Doug, I was thinking about the weakness in oil pricing. Can you comment on what you think about the contribution that sector has done for Capital Markets revenues for this year? And is there any expectation of some weakness going forward in volumes related to the weakness in oil?\n\n---\n\n【回答: A. McGregor (Executives)】\nYes. From the slides in the deck, you can see that energy is about 15% of our loans. So there's some revenues associated with that. In terms of the overall Capital Markets revenues, I mean, it varies, but it's between 5% and 10%. Energy is an important business for us both in Houston and Calgary. The run rate in the business has been pretty good recently, frankly, and whether lower energy prices will slow that or not, we'll just have to wait and see.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Brian Klock (Analysts)】\nSo let me just clarify, I guess. So when you said 15% of loans, 15% of your Capital Markets loans, the 100 -- or the 68, 69?\n\n---\n\n【回答: A. McGregor (Executives)】\nThat's correct. I think that the slide shows, I think, the loan's about $61 billion, and I think it shows us at -- what percent?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Hughes (Executives)】\nAbout 12% to 13%.\n\n---\n\n【回答: A. McGregor (Executives)】\nAbout 12% to 13%.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Hughes (Executives)】\nFor oil and gas. And energy in total, including mining, would be 15%.\n\n---\n\n【回答: A. McGregor (Executives)】\nRight. And so the energy business includes the pipelines as well as the exploration companies. And the pipelines, the CapEx that they have been spending, and they've been a big contributor to our revenues, I don't see that slowing in the near term.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Brian Klock (Analysts)】\nOkay. So -- and I guess, maybe as a follow-up, and maybe this is related to Mark. The Capital Markets, the GIL formation this quarter, there was 1 company. Was -- can you comment whether or not that was in the energy or mining and metals sector?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Hughes (Executives)】\nAs it turns out, it was actually in the energy sector, but I would say that it was completely unrelated to the oil price or the energy prices moving up and down. It was actually a fire at the facility itself, so totally unrelated to where the commodity prices are. And just to add a bit more on the percentages, it's -- for oil and gas, it's around 12% of -- 12% to 13% of the corporate banking Capital Markets book. In terms of the overall bank credit book, it's around 2% to 3%. So obviously, it's how you look at the numbers.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Brian Klock (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then maybe just, while you're on it, and then I'll get back in the queue, if you can just comment how much of that energy portfolio is E&P reserve based versus suppliers, which is a little bit more risky.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Hughes (Executives)】\nWe have about half -- or just over half of the numbers that I've been quoting is in E&P. And about 13% of it would be in the drilling and services business, which, in my mind, is where the risk will start to take in effect first as and when the E&P firms start to cut back or if they do cut back on CapEx.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Doug Young (Analysts)】\nJust the first question is on the Caribbean. And David, you made a comment in your prepared remarks that you're comfortable that it's going to return to profitability next year. I'm just trying to get some detail around where that comfort comes from. And within the Caribbean, obviously, you've made it -- you have RBTT. Just wondering how comfortable you are with the carrying value of that investment. And then I wanted to -- third part of this is I just wanted to clarify. There was a $17 million restructuring charge in the Caribbean, Janice, I think. Is that independent of $18 million that was related to the wealth?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David McKay (Executives)】\nYes. I'll make -- I'll cover the first part of that question, Doug, and then Janice will talk to the carrying value of the Caribbean bank. We've done a lot of work in the Caribbean in restructuring operations, focusing on core markets and core clients. You saw us, this year, exit RBC Jamaica, which was a significant decision for us along that line. As we look at our core operating earnings in the business, they've been improving quarter by quarter by quarter to a point where we did take some onetime credit charges this quarter, particularly in our mortgage book, as Mark referenced. But as we look forward we expect that core operating strength to emerge next year. And we're confident -- albeit the economy is tough, but we look at our revenue run rates, we look at our expense control and the repositioning of our cost base in the Caribbean and we're confident we'll return to profitability next year.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Janice Fukakusa (Executives)】\nGreat. And Doug, it's Janice. I'll answer the question on the carrying value of the investment. We constantly review the Caribbean for any indications of impairment, and we didn't see any. In addition, with respect to this quarter, we performed our annual goodwill testing, and so a lot of the details of the assumptions we made are actually in our disclosure in the consolidated statements, which describe how we've done -- looked at the cash flows and how -- the discount rates that we've used. And so we continue to be comfortable with the carrying value of the investment, and that's why you see that we did not consider any impairment at all. The $17 million charge that's in the Caribbean is totally independent of the international Wealth Management charge, and it relates to our continuing restructuring of the domestic banking businesses down there in an effort to improve efficiency.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Doug Young (Analysts)】\nAnd then if I can -- just need just a clarification. On the Insurance side, I guess for George maybe, was there any benefits that came through from actuarial assumption changes, methodology changes? We know there's some big changes coming through the life co industry, and just wondering if there was any noise in the Insurance results that boosted our earnings this quarter?\n\n---\n\n【回答: M. Lewis (Executives)】\nSure. Doug, I'll take that. The Q4 does tend to be a seasonally strong quarter for us in RBC Insurance because we do conduct our annual review of actuarial assumptions and also, it's typically a lower claims cost quarter as well. But within the annual review of actuarial assumptions, there was no significant impact from the URR change, either positive or negative. So to a large extent, several years ago, we had instituted a program to more closely match our assets and liabilities in Insurance and so -- working with finance and risk management in that respect before interest rates declined. So we did not benefit from the URR formula change to the same extent as some other players.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mario Mendonca (Analysts)】\nFirst, Janice or whomever, the bank is sticking with the 7% EPS growth target for 2015 and looking forward. First, what base would you say the bank is using, base in terms of EPS for 2014, from which to drive the 7% growth?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Janice Fukakusa (Executives)】\nI think, Mario, I think that by base you mean what is that growth rate keyed off of. And in fact, we're using our actual results in saying that we believe, in our medium-term objective, we can achieve 7% growth in the future going forward from 2014.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mario Mendonca (Analysts)】\nUsing just...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Janice Fukakusa (Executives)】\nReported.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mario Mendonca (Analysts)】\nYes, the reported number. And...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Janice Fukakusa (Executives)】\nRight.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mario Mendonca (Analysts)】\nNow I know they're medium-term objectives. But in each Q4, you do assess the results of that year against those objectives, so they tend to have -- it tends to feel like an annual target as well because of the way you assess those results in the Q4. Is that 7% something you would point us to for 2015 as well?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Janice Fukakusa (Executives)】\nWell, I think it is a medium-term objective, and we've managed to, over the past few years, meet most and this year, all of our medium-term objectives. So I think that our encompassing medium-term objective is to achieve top-performing total shareholder return. And then we encompass the financial metrics in that, and we measure on an annual basis. So I would say that if you look at it, we are not putting out annual guidance, just medium-term objectives, but we have been very successful in meeting them over the past few years.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mario Mendonca (Analysts)】\nDoes 2015 seem a little more challenging though than in prior years in getting to that 7%?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David McKay (Executives)】\nI think -- this is Dave. Based on my comments I made earlier, we see a good Canadian economy with growth across the consumer, commercial and corporate sectors. We see a very strong U.S. economy that will help drive Canada through exports. We've well positioned the U.S. in our Capital Markets business and in our wealth business to capitalize on that growth. So we have a number of ways to grow the organization, in addition to the secular trend of seeing a shift towards deposits and investments. We see a significant opportunity in our franchise to capture core areas of growth in Canada, the U.S. and emerging Europe. So I think you look at our franchise and the diversity -- diversification that we have across our businesses, so we will stand by our medium-term objectives.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mario Mendonca (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then just one final point on energy. So if it's 12% to 13% of the corporate book, it sounds like oil and gas would be something like $7 billion to $7.5 billion. What would be helpful to know is if you could break that down between the reserve-based lending and the covenant or the cash flow lending. Does anyone have that handy?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Hughes (Executives)】\nI don't actually have that handy. I would say that a large proportion of our loan book is to investment-grade large corporates, but we do have a sizable amount as well to borrowing basis. We would have to get you back the exact split on how that works.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Meny Grauman (Analysts)】\nMy question is also dealing with the impact of lower oil prices. But I was wondering about -- as you think through the implications for the Canadian P&C business in particular, I'm wondering -- maybe it's a leading question, but wondering sort of what are the -- are there positive implications from that for Canadian P&C business specifically? And where do you see those impacts hitting?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David McKay (Executives)】\nWith respect to positive drivers, being lower gas prices driving consumer spending, which is some of the commentary you see in the United States, I think it'll be modest at the end of the day. Job creation is one of the critical drivers in the economy. Business spending and exports, I think, will be the predominant drivers. We're seeing very strong export growth in the country. We're still waiting to see more private-sector investment in the economy. Those will be the primary drivers, I think, rather than lower gas prices at the pump stimulating consumer spending. It'll be marginal, I would expect.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Meny Grauman (Analysts)】\nAnd just a follow-up on that. At what point or at what price or what duration do you have to start to reappraise your outlook for 2015 when it comes to oil prices? Wondering if you could add a little bit of insight into that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Hughes (Executives)】\nOn the credit book, are you asking, specifically? Or on the...\n\n---\n\n【質問: Meny Grauman (Analysts)】\nOn the credit book specifically.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Hughes (Executives)】\nI mean, at the moment, we're doing constantly lower oil price sensitivities. We have actually gone, in an overall stress test portfolio, significantly below the current market prices. We're also doing individual name-by-name stresses against where the prices are currently and a little bit below where they are currently. And based on what I am seeing so far, given the expectation for what we have with either hedging in the E&P producers or the amount of credit availability that they still have for liquidity or the ability that they have to cut CapEx, at this point in time, we're not seeing a future deterioration with oil price. Of course, it's always about how long it goes on for. And at the moment, we are stressing out 1 year, 2 years, and we still, at this point, remain seeing things within our overall risk appetite.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Peter Routledge (Analysts)】\nI'll pick up from that last question. On Page 19, you gave us the geographic diversification of your mortgage book. It looks like 34% of your mortgages are in BC and Alberta. Is your -- do you have the same basic geographic mix for your unsecured household lending?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David McKay (Executives)】\nI don't know if we have that right at hand here. We can get back to you. But our credit strategies wouldn't change, secured or unsecured, against that region. We have a client strategy at the end of the day in the credit side, so I would expect to see an equal distribution, in that our strategies don't change in secured and unsecured, would be my answer. Mark, do you have anything to add to that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Hughes (Executives)】\nI think that would be exactly how I would answer. I don't have the specific number to hand, which we can get you. But certainly, my understanding of our strategies and how we're managing is consistent across the country, not geographic. I would also add, as -- on this oil price point, I mean, we've talked a lot more about on the corporate type and the commercial type of exposures. We are looking also on the retail side. We are able to monitor at even a community-type basis where our exposures are. So far, we have not seen outstandings or delinquencies increase in, say, the Alberta region. But that is part of our early warning signal approach. So we are monitoring that as well. I think what I would say, from a risk perspective, is until you really see unemployment hit caused by some form of lower CapEx or lower spending by the corporate side of the E&P side, you will not see that dramatic an impact or negative impact on the retail books. I think you'll see, initially, a positive impact. They'll have more cash flow, better gas prices and all of that. And the negative impact would be if people start to be unemployed as the industry cuts back, which, at this point, we have not seen happen.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Peter Routledge (Analysts)】\nDo you have any sense of how your PCLs might look a year from today if oil is still at $65 or in and around the range? PCLs from Canada I mean, specifically.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Hughes (Executives)】\nYes. At this point, they would still be within the range of our normal expectations.\n\n---\n\n【回答: David McKay (Executives)】\nRight.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Peter Routledge (Analysts)】\nThis is a slow issue?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Hughes (Executives)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Peter Routledge (Analysts)】\nDave, just a question for you on capital. I see your CET1 is about 9.9%. So it feels like the industry is trending toward 10%. In your view, what's the likelihood it goes above that? Or are we finally going to stop at 10%? And then -- well, I'll leave that question. I have a follow-up.\n\n---\n\n【回答: David McKay (Executives)】\nI think, as you've heard us comment on quarter-to-quarter, we're targeting 9.5% plus a buffer. So you're seeing us trend into that range right now at 9.9%, a little bit higher than our buffer. And I think we see good  opportunity to deploy capital into organic growth next year, and we see growth in our lending book in Canada and the U.S. So I think that is obviously a factor. And we have overall capital deployment opportunities. We've renewed our share buyback of 12 million shares, and we have all the tools available that you expect to manage our capital base, including organic opportunities to deploy capital into growth.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Peter Routledge (Analysts)】\nSo if you're at a comfortable level, will you start -- restart, I should say, your NCIB this quarter or next quarter?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Janice Fukakusa (Executives)】\nWe're -- Peter, it's Janice. We're always looking at the levels and opportunities to do that, and we did renew the NCIB because it's our intention to use it as an active capital management tool.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sohrab Movahedi (Analysts)】\nJanice, just maybe a bit of a difficult question to answer. But if you think about the overall tech spend budget, looking into 2015, how much higher do you think it's going to have to be versus 2014?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Janice Fukakusa (Executives)】\nBecause of the way that we do technology projects in that we have multiyear projects and we're always reinvesting, I would say that our tech spend budget will be very consistent next year to what we have just gone through this year. Because the nature of our programs and our commitment to invest in new technology in terms of simplifying our processes for our clients, innovation, all of that, we don't see any major shift in that. We started with these programs, a lot of them, 2 or 3 years ago, and some of them are midstream. And we continue to invest because we're investing in -- basically, on a medium term to ensure that we are always at the front end of anything happening. I don't see any shift.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sohrab Movahedi (Analysts)】\nOkay. And do you see any shift in the mix of that spend between the business segments?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Janice Fukakusa (Executives)】\nNo, we -- I don't see any shift at all in the mix.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Steve Theriault (Analysts)】\nFirst, for Doug McGregor, the decline in fixed income trading -- I apologize if this is a repeat question, by the way. But the decline in fixed income trading looks to be more than slower client activity, to me, at any rate. So I guess what I'm wondering is were there material mark-to-market losses in the fixed income books through that mid-quarter or that mid-October period of high volatility with spreads widening. Or would you really insist that it was more client activity levels?\n\n---\n\n【回答: A. McGregor (Executives)】\nWell, if you look at the FIC numbers, the headline items, first of all is the FVA. Second, that I described earlier, is that we had a credit opportunity strategy in our proprietary business that we determined to take off, and I think it was a result of -- just marks as a result of illiquidity in early and mid-October. I would say, overall, the rest of the weakness was rates was gapping up and down for the better part of 30 days. And we had, I think if you look in the disclosure, 10 or 11 days of trading losses, and they would have been $5 to $10, but that was a mix of in-GAAP in Europe -- or sorry, in FIC in Europe and the U.S. And I would say our credit books in the U.S. also were just -- we were just marking inventory and trying to provide liquidity to our clients and our customers and it got expensive. So I think as the numbers come out, you will see a trend that it was a difficult trading environment in fixed income.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Steve Theriault (Analysts)】\nOkay. The credit opportunity strategy you took off, is that Volcker related? Or that was taken off for some other reason?\n\n---\n\n【回答: A. McGregor (Executives)】\nYes, yes. It was part of the proprietary business that, as we said, we've had for a long time, and we didn't see that, anyway, that was going to comply with Volcker longer term. So the strategies that we determined would not comply, we have wound down, and the people have left.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Steve Theriault (Analysts)】\nOkay, that's helpful. And Janice, just to -- just a point of clarification. Earlier on the call, did you talk about efficiency ratio in Canadian Banking being below 40%, I thought I caught that, relative to the -- what I thought the low 40% target rate?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Janice Fukakusa (Executives)】\nNo. Steve, it was low 40s, consistent with what we've been targeting.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sumit Malhotra (Analysts)】\nA question in relation to the Wealth Management segment and the restructuring as well as the outlook going forward. So if I got your comments correct at the beginning, Dave, I think you said the businesses that you're disposing of are about 5% of revenue, but it sounds like not a very big contribution to earnings. Is that correct?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David McKay (Executives)】\nI'll let George maybe comment on that. But yes, that's correct, it's not material.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sumit Malhotra (Analysts)】\nWell -- and before George, I'll just ask. As you think about the wealth segment going forward, are there other areas of the business, particularly outside of Canada, that are under review in terms of the potential restructuring -- or potential attempts of restructuring those as well going forward?\n\n---\n\n【回答: M. Lewis (Executives)】\nSo Sumit, I'll take that. And the -- as Dave commented in his remarks, these restructuring activities in our international wealth business, it does represent a very small component of our wealth segment. And this will not impact our Global Asset Management business, which, to your point, has a very large footprint outside of Canada. It's growing well, positive flows. And it won't affect our Canadian and U.S. wealth domestic businesses either. So stepping back, for context, these international businesses at one point in time, in 2008, 2009, represented about 20% of our segment earnings. They're now close to breakeven as we've invested in strengthening the infrastructure front and middle office during a period of -- extended period of low interest rates. So what we've done is take a look at this, which has negatively impacted our trust and deposit revenues, and decided to narrow our country and client focus and concentrate on serving those international cross-border clients from our key international center in our channels where we do have scale. So that will take some time to implement. We're looking at all strategic options for the various components of the international wealth business, including identifying interested parties to purchase portions of those operations. But this will not impact our large high-performing businesses in Global Asset Management or Canadian wealth or U.S. wealth, which really drove an excellent year for us this year in terms of earnings up 22%.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sumit Malhotra (Analysts)】\nSo George, to wrap it up, I know we've had this discussion a few times over the years. But when you think about the pretax margin in the segment this year just under 24% and specifically against some of the targets that you'd provided in the past that you wanted the segment to get to and taking this first step to reposition the business, where do you think margins of this business improve to? I can probably do some of the math myself, but wanted to get your outlook on what's a more reasonable goal now that you've taken this step on the wealth side.\n\n---\n\n【回答: M. Lewis (Executives)】\nYes, sure. So I think we anticipate continuing to make progress in improving our pretax margin. Our Global Asset Management business, which represents about 60% of our earnings, is a very high-margin business, 50% pretax margins. It's why we are intent on continuing to grow it. Obviously, as we exit lower-margin businesses in international wealth, that's going to naturally improve our pretax margin, which remains our principal goal. I'd also say that looking forward to next year, we're conscious that we've benefited from robust markets in both 2013 and 2014. Our earnings were up 18% last year, 22% this year. And our plan is based on normal markets, and we intend to aim to deliver positive operating leverage in a lower revenue growth environment in 2015, if that comes to pass.\n\n---\n\n【回答: David McKay (Executives)】\nSumit, the only comment I would add is you can see a theme across our wealth and Caribbean businesses and even ITS on a focus on core markets, core clients. We understand where the growth is going to come from, and I think it's good discipline for the business to really focus on where -- focus on where that growth's going to come from. So these are important moves for us to manage areas that don't have scale and we don't believe have long-term potential for us.\n\n---\n\n【回答: David McKay (Executives)】\nI just wanted to thank everyone for joining us on the call today. And I do wish you happy holidays, and we will see you again in the new year. Thanks very much, everybody.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thanks, Jesse. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. \r\nToday, we're pleased to have the opportunity to discuss the major new customer initiative for Sherwin-Williams. On Wednesday evening, after the market close, Lowe's Improvement Centers and Sherwin-Williams issued a joint press release announcing that our HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams branded paints will be available Lowe's stores throughout the United States and on Lowe's.com, beginning the spring of 2015.  Yesterday, Lowe's senior management shared some detail and answered the questions about this new paint offering at their Investor Conference Day. One purpose of our call today is to add our comments, as well as answer any questions you might have about Sherwin-Williams' role in this exciting program. \r\nThe second purpose of our call is to update our guidance for 2014 and provide preliminary expectations for 2015 full year sales and diluted net income per common share. \r\nTo begin with, I'd like to turn the call over to John Morikis to walk you through some of the highlights of the Lowe's program, and then I'll back to summarize our expectations for 2014 and 2015. John?\n\n---\n\nThanks, Chris. Let me begin by saying how excited we are about this opportunity to expand our relationship with Lowe's. They are a long-standing valued customer of our company, and we have great respect for them as a retailer. \r\nWe believe the HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams brand, product line and color features are a perfect fit for their paint department. As most of you know, the HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams brand was introduced in Sherwin-Williams paint stores back in 2011, and it has performed very well for us over the past 3 years. The familiarity of the HGTV brand and the user-friendly color tools appeal to younger, upscale, fashion-forward consumers, who are very involved with their home decor. \r\nThe HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams product line that will be available in Lowe's stores will feature new and improved interior and exterior paint products, which will also be sold through the Sherwin-Williams company stores nationwide. \r\nIn addition, the Lowe's program will include the some new line extensions that are exclusive to Lowe's. In total, this product lineup should appeal to the mid-tier to premium paint shopper. \r\nThe HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams color palette in Lowe's will offer 16 designer-inspired color collections, 8 of which will be exclusive to Lowe's. These coordinated color cards provide a full-proof way to create a cohesive look in any one room or from room to room throughout the home, enabling homeowners to achieve the look of a professional designer. \r\nThere'll be a total of 1,100 shades within the full color offering, including the designer-inspired collections, plus other classic colors selected by the color experts at HGTV and Sherwin-Williams. \r\nAdditionally, Sherwin-Williams will provide Lowe's with 2 independent paint brands: Painter's Masterpiece and Property Net Advantage. These will serve professional painters and property managers. We'll begin shipping product in March. So the announcement will have very modest impact on first quarter 2015 sales. The load-in will be complete in time for Spring, the Spring painting season. We will incur some incremental merchandising and advertising expenses throughout the year to support this program. \r\nAgain, we're excited about this new relationship with our long-time partner, Lowe's, and we have very high expectations for this program. \r\nThanks again for joining us this morning, and let me turn the call back over to Chris.\n\n---\n\nThanks, John. I'm sure most of you saw the press release we issued before the opening bell this morning, updating our guidance for 2014 and highlighting our expectations for 2015. We thought it was important to help you decide for some of the unusual and onetime items impacting our results in the fourth quarter and into 2015. We're also providing this early indication of our expectations for 2015, in lieu of more specific detail on the financial impact of the new Lowe's paint program. We've been very consistent over the years to not disclose details about any one customer-specific relationship or program, and we intend to maintain that discipline regarding our business relationship with Lowe's. \r\nFor the full year 2014, we expect consolidated net sales will increase approximately 9% compared to full year 2013. With annual sales at that level, we are narrowing our guidance for 2014 diluted net income per common share with a higher-end of our previous range and now expect to be in the range of $8.75 to $8.80 per share, compared to $7.26 per share earned in 2013. This annual guidance includes our expectation that the Comex acquisition will reduce earnings per share by $0.28 per share in 2014. The 2014 annual guidance also includes initial startup expenses related to the HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams paint program that were not included in our previous 2014 annual guidance. \r\nIn addition, expenses were incurred in the fourth quarter related to the increasing environmental remediation cost estimates. The paint program startup expenses and environmental cost will slightly exceed the $21 million titanium dioxide settlement we received in the fourth quarter, which was disclosed in Management's Discussion and Analysis in our third quarter 2014 10-Q. These 3 unusual and onetime items in the fourth quarter, essentially cancel each other out, allowing our core operations to drive earning results in the quarter. \r\nFor the full year 2015, we expect consolidated net sales to increase 7% to 11% compared to the full year 2014. With annual sales at that level, we anticipate diluted net income per common share for 2015 will be in the range of $10.65 and $10.85 per share. This 2015 outlook includes our expectation that the HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams paint program at Lowe's will increase sales by a low single-digit percentage in the year and have a modestly positive impact on diluted net income per common share in the first year of this program. \r\nAgain, we'd like to thank you, all, for joining us this morning, and we'd be happy to take your questions.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Christopher Connor (Executives)】\nThanks, Jesse. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. \r\nToday, we're pleased to have the opportunity to discuss the major new customer initiative for Sherwin-Williams. On Wednesday evening, after the market close, Lowe's Improvement Centers and Sherwin-Williams issued a joint press release announcing that our HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams branded paints will be available Lowe's stores throughout the United States and on Lowe's.com, beginning the spring of 2015.  Yesterday, Lowe's senior management shared some detail and answered the questions about this new paint offering at their Investor Conference Day. One purpose of our call today is to add our comments, as well as answer any questions you might have about Sherwin-Williams' role in this exciting program. \r\nThe second purpose of our call is to update our guidance for 2014 and provide preliminary expectations for 2015 full year sales and diluted net income per common share. \r\nTo begin with, I'd like to turn the call over to John Morikis to walk you through some of the highlights of the Lowe's program, and then I'll back to summarize our expectations for 2014 and 2015. John?\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: John Morikis (Executives)】\nThanks, Chris. Let me begin by saying how excited we are about this opportunity to expand our relationship with Lowe's. They are a long-standing valued customer of our company, and we have great respect for them as a retailer. \r\nWe believe the HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams brand, product line and color features are a perfect fit for their paint department. As most of you know, the HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams brand was introduced in Sherwin-Williams paint stores back in 2011, and it has performed very well for us over the past 3 years. The familiarity of the HGTV brand and the user-friendly color tools appeal to younger, upscale, fashion-forward consumers, who are very involved with their home decor. \r\nThe HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams product line that will be available in Lowe's stores will feature new and improved interior and exterior paint products, which will also be sold through the Sherwin-Williams company stores nationwide. \r\nIn addition, the Lowe's program will include the some new line extensions that are exclusive to Lowe's. In total, this product lineup should appeal to the mid-tier to premium paint shopper. \r\nThe HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams color palette in Lowe's will offer 16 designer-inspired color collections, 8 of which will be exclusive to Lowe's. These coordinated color cards provide a full-proof way to create a cohesive look in any one room or from room to room throughout the home, enabling homeowners to achieve the look of a professional designer. \r\nThere'll be a total of 1,100 shades within the full color offering, including the designer-inspired collections, plus other classic colors selected by the color experts at HGTV and Sherwin-Williams. \r\nAdditionally, Sherwin-Williams will provide Lowe's with 2 independent paint brands: Painter's Masterpiece and Property Net Advantage. These will serve professional painters and property managers. We'll begin shipping product in March. So the announcement will have very modest impact on first quarter 2015 sales. The load-in will be complete in time for Spring, the Spring painting season. We will incur some incremental merchandising and advertising expenses throughout the year to support this program. \r\nAgain, we're excited about this new relationship with our long-time partner, Lowe's, and we have very high expectations for this program. \r\nThanks again for joining us this morning, and let me turn the call back over to Chris.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Christopher Connor (Executives)】\nThanks, John.

      "transcript_text3": "This is actually Matt Krueger sitting in for Ghansham today. Could you expand on the timing of the decision to bring HGTV HOME into Lowe's? Sherwin-Williams retailers have kind of been talking for quite some time now, why it has now worked out?\n\n---\n\nRight. Matt, this announcement today and yesterday has been very consistent with our long-term strategy of pursuing an architectural paint program with a big-box retailer. We are cognizant of the important position that channel owns in the DIY consumer market, and we've long said that we felt we had compelling reasons and programs that could be helpful there, and we're very pleased that we've been able to make that announcement with Lowe's today.\n\n---\n\nGreat. Next, as the HGTV HOME brand is already offered through Sherwin-Williams' store network, how much, if any, cannibalization do you expect when HGTV is introduced at Lowe's?\n\n---\n\nWe don't expect cannibalization. We think there are fundamental differences between the targeted customers that we serve through our stores into the home centers. There are customers who enjoy that format and that channel. And having our products available to them in that channel, we think, will be beneficial to our efforts there.\n\n---\n\nI was just curious in your 2015 guidance that you're assuming in terms of raw materials. Obviously, since you reported, there has been another big move-down in Brent that could impact your resin costs and then there have been some headlines that maybe TiO2 prices are going to move lower into next year. So what do assume year over year?\n\n---\n\nThis is Bob Wells. Obviously, we did make a call on raw materials in these numbers, but we're providing this sales and outlook for 2015 more to help you frame how the Lowe's program and these various other moving parts are going to affect our results. We aren't prepared on this call to discuss our raw material outlook in detail, but I can guarantee you we will be well-prepared on January 29 when we report our year-end.\n\n---\n\nFill me. If I go into a Lowe's stores in the spring, this HGTV section, what will it be displacing?\n\n---\n\nI think, from the release, we expect that both Valspar and PPG will continue to be an important supplier for Lowe's, and that's really a discussion that you need to have with Lowe's rather than us.\n\n---\n\nBut, I guess, is there some other sort of brand that goes away in this pics, as opposed to the Olympic and Valspar brands? Is there another sort of designer brand that is removed to make way here?\n\n---\n\nAgain, we're not at liberty to discuss that at this point in time.\n\n---\n\nRight. And then can you talk about -- in the press release, you talked about some exclusive extensions at Lowe's that wouldn't be in the Sherwin-Williams stores. Can you give me a little more detail what that means?\n\n---\n\nWell, again, at Lowe's request, they've asked us not to discuss any details on this. I will say that we look forward to providing them products that are good-quality products that will reach the medium and high-end quality product range.\n\n---\n\nCan you talk about the price points that you're targeting for HGTV HOME relative to some of the other offerings currently at Lowe's? And then secondly, can you talk about whether or not the Sherwin brand and logo will be prominent as part of your marketing program that you envision?\n\n---\n\nKevin, I'm happy to answer that with the best of our abilities and we're not trying to be obtuse here, but we've given you as much color as we can there. I think, John's comments about this being into mid-tier to the premium price point, which is directionally where this program will be merchandised inside a Lowe's paint department. For specific pricing and where it range relative to the other programs, this is something we're not at liberty to discuss. We'll have to wait till that comes out. And as I'm sure everybody can appreciate, we're not responsible for Lowe's pricing decisions anyway. So we'll watch with you to see where that takes shape and form. I wish we could give you more detail on that at the moment, but we can't. Your second question was relative to how will we price this at the Sherwin-Williams stores. Is that correct?\n\n---\n\nI was just curious, if I walk into Lowe's in the spring and pick up a can, am I going to see Sherwin-Williams' name and logo featured prominently or not? Just really a kind of merchandising question. Obviously, you've been reluctant to.\n\n---\n\nYes, as John mentioned, this is the -- this program will be available in both formats. So the same packaging and labeling, essentially, that we have today with the HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams brands, right on this panel, will be available in both locations.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And then last question. Can you just touch on the nature of the environmental remediation costs and what that relates to? And is it strictly onetime? Or is that something you would imagine will be recurring?\n\n---\n\nThis is Sean Hennessy, Kevin. When you take a look at the environmental call [ph] and the footnotes that we've attached to our financials, we've continued over 20 years, continued to have environmental from legacy positions and plans around the country. And as we continued through this, and the -- going through the remediation process of a couple of plants. One of other things about it, we used to have about 5 major plants and now we're down to 2 locations. So as the plans continue to come clear of where we're going to go in the remediation costs, this is just the process of the ongoing environmental cost. I will tell you that this year, we've had a lot of activity with one facility, and we think that, that activity is going to be reduced. We think that in the guidance next year, we have a more normalized year for environmental.\n\n---\n\nAnd I just wanted to ask a question on the fourth quarter guidance for '14. It looks like sales are now to be 9% up for the year versus a year earlier, pavement of 9% to 11%. Maybe can you just describe a little bit what happened in, if anything, in October or November relative to your earlier expectations?\n\n---\n\nYes. When you take a look at our expectations for fourth quarter, our Consumer Group and Global Finishes Group had a softer-than-anticipated sales thus far in the fourth quarter. The same-store group revenue growth should finish near the top end of our sales guidance and range, and Latin America Group had a soft sales for the quarter, but that was already in our guidance. So if you really look at it, stores are doing very well versus guidance. Latin America is consistent. And it was really the Global Finishes and Consumer Group.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then just taking that on to '15, maybe you can describe a little bit about the 7% to 11% and how that breaks out between the 3 segments? And then also, within paint stores, if you have any specific same-store guidance-type expectations or anything on volume and price?\n\n---\n\nYes. I think, we're going to be consistent with Bob -- the comment Bob made about the raw materials. I think, with the year-end call, we'll try to give you a little more guidance on that. I think I said  for the last couple of years, the stores group has been our driver, though. I don't think that's going to change. But specific segment-by-segment guidance, I don't -- we're not prepared today.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then just as a follow-up, I was looking out long-term. I know this is, as you commented, right, I guess, changes in strategy or I know you've been looking for a while. Where do you see that going long term? Did you see other programs like this taking hold in the Big Box? And does that mean that you've discussed with other partners as well?\n\n---\n\nI mean, we've had a long-standing relationship with hardware channels, discounts, Big Box home centers, a great platform of brands of this company, Minwax, Thompson's, Purdy, White Lightning, caulk, [indiscernible], stains now at Lowe's with HGTV HOME. So our company's strategy has been to partner with all of these outstanding third-party retailers to build as many sales as we can through their department with our platform of brands. This is not a change in our strategy. The Sherwin-Williams brand of professional painting products and our core high-end DIY consumer products remain in the sole purview of our store organization. But where this goes going forward, if we can find more of our retailers to sell these powerful brands, so we'd be happy to do that.\n\n---\n\nI guess, 3 questions around the new piece of business. First, most of the press releases they talk so far is about the HGTV part. But what's the opportunities split between that and then the Painter's Masterpiece and the Property Advantage would be one. Two, what's the normal -- I mean, obviously we've got a load-in inventory. Next year, we probably got to do a little bit of a increased ad spend for this. When we book in the out-years, how does that trail down in kind of year 2, 3, as we look out to model this? And then just on the administrative side, will this be a straight split, where the volumes through Lowe's goes through consumer and what's still sold in their stores goes to the paint stores? Or how will that be split between the segments?\n\n---\n\nSo I will take the first one, the HGTV versus the painter and property management. We're very excited about that entire program. When you look at the HGTV by Sherwin-Williams, we think the combination of HGTV and the confidence it brings with color and the strength of the quality of Sherwin-Williams is a compelling offer. And so we believe that it will certainly drive business into the DIY channels for -- aisles for Lowe's, and we look forward to supporting that. How it relates to the painters and the property management? Again, I think it goes back to the section of customers that prefer that home center channel. We do know that there are some professionals that prefer that channel. And we feel that this product line will fit that -- their needs quite well, and we look forward to supporting those. The balance and mix of those, we believe, were predominantly towards the DIY. If you look at the mix that Lowe's talks about in their stores, it's slanted that way, and we would expect that it would follow similar nature.\n\n---\n\nAnd Duffy, I'll take your third question in a second. You're 100% accurate. 100% of the sales to Lowe's on this program will go through our consumer segment, so 100%. And as you said, any of the sales that we currently are realizing through the Paint Stores Group will stay in the Paint Stores Group. As far as -- you're right. The first year, we do expect a load-in, but we're also expecting some of that load-in expenses, which is why we talked about the slight accretion. We don't think that the load-in expenses will repeat on an ongoing basis. But as far as sales, because of this program and the timing of this program and we're our calendar year reporter, not a -- at the beginning of March. So when you take a look at it, we think that the amount of reduction due to the load-in, the first-time load-in, may actually be eliminated. So in the future -- we're feeling pretty good about the future of the program and what the sales could be on an ongoing basis. We don't see this as a sales hit in calendar year 2016, maybe the first quarter.\n\n---\n\nIt's Silke Kueck for Jeff. Once you conclude the load-in expenses in 2015, will the margins from the HGTV business be similar to the 18% that you have in the consumer business currently?\n\n---\n\nYes, Silke, we've been specific over the years about maintaining confidentiality of specific customer programs and relationship, and especially, the profitability of any one customer or any one program. And I don't think we're going to make an exception for this one. Because of the timing of this and the size, we thought we should give you some color for 2015 and some of the onetime hits we're going to take in the fourth quarter of 2014, but I don't think we're going to answer that question about the margin and the operating margins for each individual programs.\n\n---\n\nI don't even wanted [indiscernible]. I was just wondering it's whether, like, different.\n\n---\n\nWell, I would say that what you're going to see is that program will be in our ongoing guidance in the future. And it'll be -- we're not going to break out segments, the consumer any finer than that.\n\n---\n\nWhen you're going to Sherwin-Williams website, like the HGTV brand, it sort of like offered at like, I don't know, $39 a gallon for the interior paint, like $43 a gallon for exterior paint. Were those sort of that what one would expect to see at Lowe's? And then there are sort of other items that are offered under the HGTV program, that brusher and rollers and masking tape and painter kits, and these are all things that, I guess, Valspar didn't offer. Will those products also be offered at Lowe's for Sherwin?\n\n---\n\nSilke, on the pricing, again, you're accurate. Those are the prices that the program certainly is listed at inside of Sherwin-Williams store. But we're not in liberty today to discuss prices inside the Lowe's format. We have tried to give you guidance that will be at the mid-tier to the premium price point in Lowe's. Regarding the AP products, those will -- HGTV-branded associated products will be sold through the Sherwin-Williams store, but this program does not include the sale of that to the Lowe's format.\n\n---\n\nSo when I look at your 2015 guidance, I guess, assuming that you kind of keep your normal incremental margins in the, call it, low 30s, I get to some numbers that are kind of solve the above what you just guided to. So I guess, I'm wondering -- and that's not making any assumptions for walls [ph] or anything like that. So I guess, what I'm wondering is, are there any negatives or determinants that we should be thinking about, that might not come to mind right away, that are dragging those numbers down in terms of your guidance for '15?\n\n---\n\nNo, and I think that's why we try to mention that this program is going to be slightly accretive. There is -- we're not going to be anywhere near 30% flow-through on these incremental sales.\n\n---\n\nOkay, fair enough. And then, I guess, the other question I had, I believe, when you originally signed the contract with HGTV, it was a 7-year contract. So we're largely what, a little bit more than halfway through that. Has that been extended? And do you still have the rights to extend that?\n\n---\n\nYes, we're not commenting on that HGTV contract. I think, you should read into this announcement today that we're investing a lot of money behind this with a new program and we're in good shape with that contract going forward.\n\n---\n\nTwo questions, one about that the contractors' brand, the Painter's Masterpiece and property management, I don't know the exact name of them, or Property Advantage. Do you sell those now? Or are those newly created? And is the plan to do some sort of delivery with those products, sort of like Elmatha's [ph] doing with Home Depot? How should we think about those products at Lowe's? Then I had a follow-up.\n\n---\n\nNo, those are the exclusive products for Lowe's. And as far as the distribution of those products, that will go -- you'll need to talk to Lowe's about the distribution for those.\n\n---\n\nBut the way, I mean, you'll supply them the way you're supplying the HGTV thing. Is that the way?\n\n---\n\nThat's exactly right.\n\n---\n\nThat's right.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then second, I think, Sean, you mentioned Global Finishes and Consumer Group were both weaker than expectation. Just, what drove that?\n\n---\n\nNo, I think -- yes. If -- again, not to be evasive, I think what we prefer to do is wait till we have the actual for the fourth quarter and then give you some more color on that in the next phone call.\n\n---\n\nCan I ask another question? In your sales guidance for next year, what do you assume for currency?\n\n---\n\nWe don't see any favorableness in Brazil, slightly favorable. We think that Argentina is going to be negative. And we have -- in Europe, we have it slightly accretive because of the way different things are moving.\n\n---\n\nSo sort of...\n\n---\n\nSo low impact.\n\n---\n\nBut not a huge impact?\n\n---\n\nCorrect.\n\n---\n\nCorrect.\n\n---\n\nThis is actually Chris Bottiglieri on for Aram. I have a question on how it's related to the international opportunities. Will this given to Lowe's Mexican, Canadian and even in the Australian JV?\n\n---\n\nWe might have the opportunity downstream, but today we're just announcing the U.S. program.\n\n---\n\nGot you. Okay. But if you did go downstream on that, would that be something that you may feel to extend internationally in terms of other home improvement, where the North American ones aren't currently stationed?\n\n---\n\nThat's perspective there, I am not prepared to comment on that today.\n\n---\n\nOkay. All right. That's fair. And maybe I can ask one more then. Can you just frame the opportunity? Obviously, this is kind of a second. You haven't traditionally played it in as well. Can you maybe just frame it in terms of the overall segment of the market that you're not currently addressing and how this kind of fits in? The high level math seems to suggest maybe about 25%, but just wanted to see what your thoughts were.\n\n---\n\nIn terms of how this program fits into a market that we have been previously telling you, is that your question?\n\n---\n\nWhat is DIY and the home improvement share of DIY?\n\n---\n\nYes. So obviously, we've been participating in the DIY marketing through our many third-party retailing partners. We have not enjoyed an architectural paint program at -- in the major big-box retailers, and this is an opportunity for us to now be able to enjoy that. So our experience here was good. Our marketing teams know how to address this. So we expect this will be a solid program.\n\n---\n\nI just wanted to follow on that last question, because I think the devil's advocate way of looking at this is that the #2 big-box retailer just got a gift thrown in their lap of one of the best paint brands in the country and in the world. Frame how this works for Sherwin-Williams and what the upside is for you guys, whether it's something today or brand extension down the road. Because other than the revenue and the EPS benefit that you might see in '15, I am struggling to understand why this is a good idea for Sherwin-Williams.\n\n---\n\nWell, we think, it's a terrific idea for these 3 brands uniquely to become together at this point in time, Jay. HGTV by Sherwin-Williams is a brand that we took on to our stores a number of years ago. In order to give it its full platform and exposure to the DIY consumer, this is the logical extension of it. This has no impact on our expectation of our stores' growth. We continue to have terrific plans in place to expand that network, as you know, by 1,000 locations, primarily focus on expanding our share position against the painting contract or in all the end segments that they participate in. This simply takes another opportunity in a powerful retailing segment than we hadn't been previously playing in to expand this reach. We think this program will be -- will resonate for all the reasons that John talked about, on color and design and attract a new customer to these products and help this retailer expand their share position. Those are the kinds of things that we do each and every day across all of our brands with all of our segments and important customers. So we think the future will tell the impact. But from right now, we think this is going to be a terrific decision for the company.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then just wanted to follow up on a comment that John made earlier about certain pros and wanting to buy their paint through the DIY channel. So do you guys expect, does Lowe's expect, a tax rate with that Sherwin-Williams brand name? Or do they expect attach rates to move up? Is that going to help your sales of ancillary products? Can you talk about that a little bit?\n\n---\n\nYes. So, we've talked for a long time, Jay, about the value of that shopping environment for certain trades, like remodelers, handymen, property management firms that are purchasing a whole host of products to maintain their properties or run their businesses that can be found in the big-box environment. And we've be very cognizant that, that professional trade does shop in that channel. So this is an opportunity for us with these 2 dedicated professional brands that John mentioned, as well as that would trade up to the HGTV by Sherwin brand as well, to find a product inside that box that can help them with their businesses. So every big-box retailer is focused on supporting their pro initiative, and this is part of a whole program that we're offering to Lowe's to help them do that.\n\n---\n\nFirst question. John, you made the comment, I think, that you said that the customer -- there were some fundamental differences between the DIY customers, between yourself and Lowe's. I was just wondering if you can maybe elaborate on that a little bit, what you guys see as the key differences?\n\n---\n\nFirst, I'm speaking to the pro there, but I do think that there are DIY customers as well that prefer to go into a shopping environment where they can purchase a wide variety of products that are available at a home center.\n\n---\n\nOkay, fair enough. And then, Chris, I think it's fair to say there's probably no bigger defender of the Sherwin-Williams brand than you, so I commented that internally you guys are very comfortable with how that could impact the stores group. But is there anything, even if it's on the margin and a low probability risk, that you'll be watching or you think could come from the program?\n\n---\n\nWell, I think, one thing that we expect to happen is we think the HGTV by Sherwin brand inside the Sherwin-Williams stores is going to get a lift. This brand will get tremendous more awareness and recognition and advertising support as a result of this launch. Our stores remain very committed to the program, the color merchandising tool unique to  HGTV brands and we're fully supportive of the initiative going forward. So we see this as a win-win for both sides. As I mentioned on the earlier call to Jay, this doesn't detract, from 1 second, the real drivers of that core business for us, which is, continued expansion, continued focus on the professional painting contractor. None of that changes with this announcement.\n\n---\n\nIf we look at the stores' sales mix, about 15% of it's DIY. Can you comment on what percent of HGTV paint is DIY, out of the stores right now, over the past 12 months?\n\n---\n\nYes. So our HGTV sales will be primary DIY sales through our stores, but that's as close as we'll break that down.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Well, that's fair. Will there be any -- Chris, any -- or John, you might comment on this as well. Will it be any wider quality range of the HGTV brand at Lowe's, as compared to which you're selling in the Sherwin stores?\n\n---\n\nYes, there is, Chuck. As I mentioned, there'll be a couple of lines going in there, first line in at the good quality and then one above that in the higher quality range.\n\n---\n\nOkay. I took that to mean -- and I was thinking about the property manager line and the other, the pro painter line. Okay, great.\n\n---\n\nThose would be in addition to the HGTV by Sherwin.\n\n---\n\nAll right. So excellent. And then, Sean, can you give us an idea what the cost split will be between the environmental remediation costs and the load-in cost will be in the fourth quarter? I just know that the total is going to be a little over $21 million, but can you break that down further?\n\n---\n\nAnd Chuck, I think we're going to wait for the year-end call, because, as you know, we put the exact number in for the environmental expenses and some of the releases are the -- our financial release data. But suffice to say, I think it goes back to Chris's. It's very close between the titanium dioxide money that we did receive in the fourth quarter and those 2 big onetime hits.\n\n---\n\nMy question on the HGTV. Does the agreement with Lowe's preclude you from offering the HGTV brand at outside of your stores and outside of Lowe's? I know there is probably some exclusive SKUs at Lowe's.\n\n---\n\nIt does preclude us from taking it anywhere else, yes.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then what sort of cannibalization have you seen from HGTV or expect to see on your Dutch Boy and Pratt & Lambert brands?\n\n---\n\nWe don't expect to see any cannibalization.\n\n---\n\nI guess, we're still catching here in the morning time frame here. A couple of questions. A lot of my questions have been answered, but I'd like to follow-up on a couple of things. First of all, with respect to the pro paint line, which will be launching at Lowe's, Home Depot in there. And [indiscernible] sort of supporting the pro initiatives, has dedicated some external sales to folks to help shore up the contractors' channel and the pro-channel. Is there going to be any tie-in with these brands into your outside sales force? In other words, is there going to be an incremental effort by your external sales force to now drive  customers into these stores and help support these brands for the pro?\n\n---\n\nNo, Dmitry. Our current external sales force,  supporting the Sherwin's team, will remain solely  focused on driving painters into the Sherwin paint stores.\n\n---\n\nSo there's going to more incremental sales people you will be adding to support this program within Lowe's?\n\n---\n\nWe will be adding incremental sales people. You asked that the existing ones we're doing that. But we'll have a new sales service team. It will be aligned with this program to support the program.\n\n---\n\nGot it. Okay. And then sort of following up on an earlier question about the Sherwin-Williams brand and your long-term statement that you don't want to see Sherwin-Williams brand outside of Sherwin-Williams stores, Dutch Boys and Pratt & Lambert. And you have to look long and hard at a label before you a find a Sherwin-Williams brand versus if you're preferring to the brand new offering at Lowe's as HGTV by Sherwin-Williams, so it sounds like it will be a fairly predominant feature of the label, in a sort of building customer loyalty and customer cautiousness. So how does that sort of jive with your earlier resistance to letting go of Sherwin-Williams brands into third-party retailers?\n\n---\n\nSo the brand that Lowe's will be selling, as you said, is going to be the HGTV by Sherwin-Williams. And while this brand will also be sold through our paint stores, it is distinct from the core Sherwin-Williams branded product line. So that's everything. That is combination of the HGTV and Sherwin-Williams is a very compelling brand appeal. And as I'd also mention that HGTV is well known regarding their design and color expertise, our Sherwin space as far as the product quality. And making that available inside Lowe's, we think makes sense. That is -- there is a distinct difference between that and the brands that will continue to be sold exclusively in the Sherwin-Williams stores.\n\n---\n\nAnd I might to add to that -- those good comment, Dmitry, that the brand for us is clearly the brand of paint, but it's also the brand of the store and the entire experience that a professional painting contractor finds in a dedicated paint per channel, with a breath of product selection, et cetera. So one SKU of a HGTV by Sherwin in a different channel doesn't disrupt, in our opinion, that trust and relationship that's been built with the pro.\n\n---\n\nOkay, fair enough. And then just one final question. There was another question about sort of the timing of this program and how long you've worked on that. I'll try to ask it a different way. It sounded like, at least from the research we've done, that the reserve at Lowe's and the higher end of products that [indiscernible] put out at the Home Depot sort of have caused a little bit of an attrition from a contractor story, DIY customers, that are now seeing sort of comparable quality products in the big-box channels. So how much of this program is sort of a defensive response to that versus sort of an constant expansion of your channel and really going after new opportunities?\n\n---\n\nI would say, almost no impact, as a defensive measure. We've shared with you the terrific sales results we've been generating through our stores platform, both on the Pro and the DIY side. This is an opportunity for us to run significant incremental balance through our manufacturing logistics chain and build a powerful brand that we think will help Lowe's and Sherwin-Williams both.\n\n---\n\nTwo things. First of all, the Pro brands that you're introducing at Lowe's, could you characterize the market sector that, that's pursuing in terms of the Pro customer? And then, secondly, you referenced that there will be some salespeople that you'll be allocating a new sales people to sell the product. Can you talk a little bit more specifically of what of product they're aimed at selling and that kind of question, the first question as well?\n\n---\n\nSure. The products are going to be aimed primarily as the remodelers, the repainting contractors and then also the property managers. And regarding the sales force, as Chris mentioned, we are going to be putting some people to -- that are going to be dedicated as sale and services organization, but we're not at liberty to provide any details on that at this time.\n\n---\n\nWithin that remodel/repaint property manager group, how do you feel your share is there relative to your share of Pros in total? And that's kind of across the overall Sherwin-Williams. What I'm trying to figure out is, is this the segment of customers that Lowe's perhaps can do a better job accessing than you do out of your core stores?  At least relative...\n\n---\n\nSure. I get it, Eric. So -- sure, I understand the question. If you think about how we shared with you historically, the company's relative share positions against certain contractor segments. For example, the large commercial painting contractors, the new residential painting contractors, those are the positions where the companies had really strong share. When you get into the residential repaint and the remodeler, the share position is at the lower end of our share spectrum. For all the reasons that makes perfect intuitive sense, much larger universe of customers, much smaller in nature and the types of products that purchase to do their businesses can also be found in the home center environment. So our share position will be lower there. That's a pro that goes into the big-boxes to begin with, and now here's a program from Sherwin-Williams that we can help generate some revenue for the company.\n\n---\n\nBob, when you said you'll address raw material cost in more detail in January, should we view the current guidance you just gave for 2015 is preliminary, and if raw materials change between now and then, you might update it?\n\n---\n\nJohn, yes, absolutely. If raw materials change between now and then, it would change our outlook. But we did have an outlook for raw materials baked into these numbers.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then your earnings guidance seems relatively narrow compared to your sales guidance. If you were at the lower end of the sales guidance, would there be less store openings and that might be why it's kind of dampened to downside, if sales are at the low end? And conversely, if you're at the high end, you may open up more stores, which would reduce the earnings effect?\n\n---\n\nNo, John. I think, that when you take a look it at it, the store, the plan is pretty well set in stone how many stores are going to open. The distribution increases that we're going to have, I think, some of that guidance is going back to the raw materials and so forth, and we'll what we now have with Thompson. And we've taken a position and our view of the raw materials and we'll see how that goes, and there's many out there right now. So we'll see which the raw materials that really drove that widening of the sales versus profit.\n\n---\n\nAnd can you just remind me of the Comex assumptions for 2015?\n\n---\n\nSure. To put something in 2014, we still expect that we're going to lose $0.28 a share, and we expect that $0.08 to $0.13 accretion from that, next year, in 2015.\n\n---\n\nJust a couple of quick ones. Is this program going to require a new plant? Or do you have that volume in your existing manufacturing footprint to supply?\n\n---\n\nWe have the existing capacity. We'll have some minor issues that will address to help throughput in the plants, but we have existing capacity in our footprint.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And then in terms of the sales force or to support this program, how big of an impact will that have on your SG&A costs?\n\n---\n\nI think, it's baked into our guidance. I don't think we're going to break out SG&A by again by an individual customer.\n\n---\n\nI just had quick counting of financial reporting question. The onetime items that in the fourth quarter, where will they show up on the income statement, and specifically the TiO2 settlements?\n\n---\n\nTiO2 will be in our gross margin. So that $21 million will inflate our gross profit, as a percent in dollars this year. The other pieces will be in SG&A. The raw materials, the titanium will be through predominantly the stores group in the consumer segment. The SG&A for the program will be in the consumer segment, and the environmental will be in the administrative segment.\n\n---\n\nOkay, great. And second question. When you talk about new sales people related to the program, are you talking about in the stores to help the customers or just dealing with Lowe's itself?\n\n---\n\nYes. Really, at this time, we've been asked not to comment on the roles the sales organization is going to play.\n\n---\n\nIt's Silke Valdes. I just have a few follow-ups. One, can you tell us when did you learn that you won the Sherwin-Williams -- I'm sorry, that Sherwin-Williams won the Lowe's business.\n\n---\n\nJust recently.\n\n---\n\nSo like 2 weeks ago, a week ago?\n\n---\n\nWe're really not at liberty to discuss that, Silke. We announced it as soon as we were allowed to announce it, on Wednesday evening.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And my recollection, as I said, when you do business with Lowe's, like at all product lines if those are like, I don't know, like an annual review period, so is that program with Lowe's, will that come under like annual review? Or can how long you will have the program for?\n\n---\n\nI would just say that when you take a look at the financial investment we're making, I think that it's significant. Whenever you go in with a program, there is an understanding that there is a period of time that we're going to be -- get a return for our investment.\n\n---\n\nAnd when the launch happens in March, will it happen at all of the 1,800 stores or happens it sort of  like in one geographic region and then in another?\n\n---\n\nYes, Lowe's will be responsible for that rollout. And it will happen, as you explain. It is impossible that over night we can set 1,800 stores. So they will be rolling it out throughout their country on their schedule and then their determination of which market's first.\n\n---\n\nDoes it take like a quarter-or-so? Or can you do it in like -- can you it do it faster than that?\n\n---\n\nWe'll be moving as fast as Lowe's would like us to move.\n\n---\n\nAnd the last question, I mean -- just like one time I'd like to repeat the material question. If oil prices stayed at $60 a barrel for all of next year, do you think that your 2015 earnings guidance would already reflect that scenario?\n\n---\n\nThat's a little too much detail for us to get into on this call, Silke.\n\n---\n\nThat sounds like no to me.\n\n---\n\nNo, we're not saying that. I mean, we took a call on oil prices also. So we're not going to. We've never talked of what we thought the oil for the year and so forth. So yes, but we have a view of what we think the oil prices will be on average next year.\n\n---\n\nWell, thanks, again, Jesse. And thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. As always, I will be available this afternoon to answer any additional questions. And we'd all like to thank you for taking the time to participate on the call, and thanks for your continued interest in Sherwin-Williams.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Matthew Krueger (Analysts)】\nThis is actually Matt Krueger sitting in for Ghansham today. Could you expand on the timing of the decision to bring HGTV HOME into Lowe's? Sherwin-Williams retailers have kind of been talking for quite some time now, why it has now worked out?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Christopher Connor (Executives)】\nRight. Matt, this announcement today and yesterday has been very consistent with our long-term strategy of pursuing an architectural paint program with a big-box retailer. We are cognizant of the important position that channel owns in the DIY consumer market, and we've long said that we felt we had compelling reasons and programs that could be helpful there, and we're very pleased that we've been able to make that announcement with Lowe's today.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matthew Krueger (Analysts)】\nGreat. Next, as the HGTV HOME brand is already offered through Sherwin-Williams' store network, how much, if any, cannibalization do you expect when HGTV is introduced at Lowe's?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Morikis (Executives)】\nWe don't expect cannibalization. We think there are fundamental differences between the targeted customers that we serve through our stores into the home centers. There are customers who enjoy that format and that channel. And having our products available to them in that channel, we think, will be beneficial to our efforts there.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Vincent Andrews (Analysts)】\nI was just curious in your 2015 guidance that you're assuming in terms of raw materials. Obviously, since you reported, there has been another big move-down in Brent that could impact your resin costs and then there have been some headlines that maybe TiO2 prices are going to move lower into next year. So what do assume year over year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert Wells (Executives)】\nThis is Bob Wells. Obviously, we did make a call on raw materials in these numbers, but we're providing this sales and outlook for 2015 more to help you frame how the Lowe's program and these various other moving parts are going to affect our results. We aren't prepared on this call to discuss our raw material outlook in detail, but I can guarantee you we will be well-prepared on January 29 when we report our year-end.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Koort (Analysts)】\nFill me. If I go into a Lowe's stores in the spring, this HGTV section, what will it be displacing?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Christopher Connor (Executives)】\nI think, from the release, we expect that both Valspar and PPG will continue to be an important supplier for Lowe's, and that's really a discussion that you need to have with Lowe's rather than us.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Koort (Analysts)】\nBut, I guess, is there some other sort of brand that goes away in this pics, as opposed to the Olympic and Valspar brands? Is there another sort of designer brand that is removed to make way here?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Christopher Connor (Executives)】\nAgain, we're not at liberty to discuss that at this point in time.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Koort (Analysts)】\nRight. And then can you talk about -- in the press release, you talked about some exclusive extensions at Lowe's that wouldn't be in the Sherwin-Williams stores. Can you give me a little more detail what that means?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Morikis (Executives)】\nWell, again, at Lowe's request, they've asked us not to discuss any details on this. I will say that we look forward to providing them products that are good-quality products that will reach the medium and high-end quality product range.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kevin McCarthy (Analysts)】\nCan you talk about the price points that you're targeting for HGTV HOME relative to some of the other offerings currently at Lowe's? And then secondly, can you talk about whether or not the Sherwin brand and logo will be prominent as part of your marketing program that you envision?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Christopher Connor (Executives)】\nKevin, I'm happy to answer that with the best of our abilities and we're not trying to be obtuse here, but we've given you as much color as we can there. I think, John's comments about this being into mid-tier to the premium price point, which is directionally where this program will be merchandised inside a Lowe's paint department. For specific pricing and where it range relative to the other programs, this is something we're not at liberty to discuss. We'll have to wait till that comes out. And as I'm sure everybody can appreciate, we're not responsible for Lowe's pricing decisions anyway. So we'll watch with you to see where that takes shape and form. I wish we could give you more detail on that at the moment, but we can't. Your second question was relative to how will we price this at the Sherwin-Williams stores. Is that correct?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kevin McCarthy (Analysts)】\nI was just curious, if I walk into Lowe's in the spring and pick up a can, am I going to see Sherwin-Williams' name and logo featured prominently or not? Just really a kind of merchandising question. Obviously, you've been reluctant to.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Christopher Connor (Executives)】\nYes, as John mentioned, this is the -- this program will be available in both formats. So the same packaging and labeling, essentially, that we have today with the HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams brands, right on this panel, will be available in both locations.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kevin McCarthy (Analysts)】\nGreat. And then last question. Can you just touch on the nature of the environmental remediation costs and what that relates to? And is it strictly onetime? Or is that something you would imagine will be recurring?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Sean Hennessy (Executives)】\nThis is Sean Hennessy, Kevin. When you take a look at the environmental call [ph] and the footnotes that we've attached to our financials, we've continued over 20 years, continued to have environmental from legacy positions and plans around the country. And as we continued through this, and the -- going through the remediation process of a couple of plants. One of other things about it, we used to have about 5 major plants and now we're down to 2 locations. So as the plans continue to come clear of where we're going to go in the remediation costs, this is just the process of the ongoing environmental cost. I will tell you that this year, we've had a lot of activity with one facility, and we think that, that activity is going to be reduced. We think that in the guidance next year, we have a more normalized year for environmental.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Arun Viswanathan (Analysts)】\nAnd I just wanted to ask a question on the fourth quarter guidance for '14. It looks like sales are now to be 9% up for the year versus a year earlier, pavement of 9% to 11%. Maybe can you just describe a little bit what happened in, if anything, in October or November relative to your earlier expectations?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Sean Hennessy (Executives)】\nYes. When you take a look at our expectations for fourth quarter, our Consumer Group and Global Finishes Group had a softer-than-anticipated sales thus far in the fourth quarter. The same-store group revenue growth should finish near the top end of our sales guidance and range, and Latin America Group had a soft sales for the quarter, but that was already in our guidance. So if you really look at it, stores are doing very well versus guidance. Latin America is consistent. And it was really the Global Finishes and Consumer Group.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Arun Viswanathan (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then just taking that on to '15, maybe you can describe a little bit about the 7% to 11% and how that breaks out between the 3 segments? And then also, within paint stores, if you have any specific same-store guidance-type expectations or anything on volume and price?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Sean Hennessy (Executives)】\nYes. I think, we're going to be consistent with Bob -- the comment Bob made about the raw materials. I think, with the year-end call, we'll try to give you a little more guidance on that. I think I said  for the last couple of years, the stores group has been our driver, though. I don't think that's going to change. But specific segment-by-segment guidance, I don't -- we're not prepared today.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Arun Viswanathan (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then just as a follow-up, I was looking out long-term. I know this is, as you commented, right, I guess, changes in strategy or I know you've been looking for a while. Where do you see that going long term? Did you see other programs like this taking hold in the Big Box? And does that mean that you've discussed with other partners as well?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Christopher Connor (Executives)】\nI mean, we've had a long-standing relationship with hardware channels, discounts, Big Box home centers, a great platform of brands of this company, Minwax, Thompson's, Purdy, White Lightning, caulk, [indiscernible], stains now at Lowe's with HGTV HOME. So our company's strategy has been to partner with all of these outstanding third-party retailers to build as many sales as we can through their department with our platform of brands. This is not a change in our strategy. The Sherwin-Williams brand of professional painting products and our core high-end DIY consumer products remain in the sole purview of our store organization. But where this goes going forward, if we can find more of our retailers to sell these powerful brands, so we'd be happy to do that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Duffy Fischer (Analysts)】\nI guess, 3 questions around the new piece of business. First, most of the press releases they talk so far is about the HGTV part. But what's the opportunities split between that and then the Painter's Masterpiece and the Property Advantage would be one. Two, what's the normal -- I mean, obviously we've got a load-in inventory. Next year, we probably got to do a little bit of a increased ad spend for this. When we book in the out-years, how does that trail down in kind of year 2, 3, as we look out to model this? And then just on the administrative side, will this be a straight split, where the volumes through Lowe's goes through consumer and what's still sold in their stores goes to the paint stores? Or how will that be split between the segments?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Morikis (Executives)】\nSo I will take the first one, the HGTV versus the painter and property management. We're very excited about that entire program. When you look at the HGTV by Sherwin-Williams, we think the combination of HGTV and the confidence it brings with color and the strength of the quality of Sherwin-Williams is a compelling offer. And so we believe that it will certainly drive business into the DIY channels for -- aisles for Lowe's, and we look forward to supporting that. How it relates to the painters and the property management? Again, I think it goes back to the section of customers that prefer that home center channel. We do know that there are some professionals that prefer that channel. And we feel that this product line will fit that -- their needs quite well, and we look forward to supporting those. The balance and mix of those, we believe, were predominantly towards the DIY. If you look at the mix that Lowe's talks about in their stores, it's slanted that way, and we would expect that it would follow similar nature.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Sean Hennessy (Executives)】\nAnd Duffy, I'll take your third question in a second. You're 100% accurate. 100% of the sales to Lowe's on this program will go through our consumer segment, so 100%. And as you said, any of the sales that we currently are realizing through the Paint Stores Group will stay in the Paint Stores Group. As far as -- you're right. The first year, we do expect a load-in, but we're also expecting some of that load-in expenses, which is why we talked about the slight accretion. We don't think that the load-in expenses will repeat on an ongoing basis. But as far as sales, because of this program and the timing of this program and we're our calendar year reporter, not a -- at the beginning of March. So when you take a look at it, we think that the amount of reduction due to the load-in, the first-time load-in, may actually be eliminated. So in the future -- we're feeling pretty good about the future of the program and what the sales could be on an ongoing basis. We don't see this as a sales hit in calendar year 2016, maybe the first quarter.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Silke Kueck (Analysts)】\nIt's Silke Kueck for Jeff. Once you conclude the load-in expenses in 2015, will the margins from the HGTV business be similar to the 18% that you have in the consumer business currently?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert Wells (Executives)】\nYes, Silke, we've been specific over the years about maintaining confidentiality of specific customer programs and relationship, and especially, the profitability of any one customer or any one program. And I don't think we're going to make an exception for this one. Because of the timing of this and the size, we thought we should give you some color for 2015 and some of the onetime hits we're going to take in the fourth quarter of 2014, but I don't think we're going to answer that question about the margin and the operating margins for each individual programs.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Silke Kueck (Analysts)】\nI don't even wanted [indiscernible]. I was just wondering it's whether, like, different.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert Wells (Executives)】\nWell, I would say that what you're going to see is that program will be in our ongoing guidance in the future. And it'll be -- we're not going to break out segments, the consumer any finer than that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Silke Kueck (Analysts)】\nWhen you're going to Sherwin-Williams website, like the HGTV brand, it sort of like offered at like, I don't know, $39 a gallon for the interior paint, like $43 a gallon for exterior paint. Were those sort of that what one would expect to see at Lowe's? And then there are sort of other items that are offered under the HGTV program, that brusher and rollers and masking tape and painter kits, and these are all things that, I guess, Valspar didn't offer. Will those products also be offered at Lowe's for Sherwin?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Christopher Connor (Executives)】\nSilke, on the pricing, again, you're accurate. Those are the prices that the program certainly is listed at inside of Sherwin-Williams store. But we're not in liberty today to discuss prices inside the Lowe's format. We have tried to give you guidance that will be at the mid-tier to the premium price point in Lowe's. Regarding the AP products, those will -- HGTV-branded associated products will be sold through the Sherwin-Williams store, but this program does not include the sale of that to the Lowe's format.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John McNulty (Analysts)】\nSo when I look at your 2015 guidance, I guess, assuming that you kind of keep your normal incremental margins in the, call it, low 30s, I get to some numbers that are kind of solve the above what you just guided to. So I guess, I'm wondering -- and that's not making any assumptions for walls [ph] or anything like that. So I guess, what I'm wondering is, are there any negatives or determinants that we should be thinking about, that might not come to mind right away, that are dragging those numbers down in terms of your guidance for '15?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Christopher Connor (Executives)】\nNo, and I think that's why we try to mention that this program is going to be slightly accretive. There is -- we're not going to be anywhere near 30% flow-through on these incremental sales.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John McNulty (Analysts)】\nOkay, fair enough. And then, I guess, the other question I had, I believe, when you originally signed the contract with HGTV, it was a 7-year contract. So we're largely what, a little bit more than halfway through that. Has that been extended? And do you still have the rights to extend that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Christopher Connor (Executives)】\nYes, we're not commenting on that HGTV contract. I think, you should read into this announcement today that we're investing a lot of money behind this with a new program and we're in good shape with that contract going forward.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gregory Melich (Analysts)】\nTwo questions, one about that the contractors' brand, the Painter's Masterpiece and property management, I don't know the exact name of them, or Property Advantage. Do you sell those now? Or are those newly created? And is the plan to do some sort of delivery with those products, sort of like Elmatha's [ph] doing with Home Depot? How should we think about those products at Lowe's? Then I had a follow-up.\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Morikis (Executives)】\nNo, those are the exclusive products for Lowe's. And as far as the distribution of those products, that will go -- you'll need to talk to Lowe's about the distribution for those.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gregory Melich (Analysts)】\nBut the way, I mean, you'll supply them the way you're supplying the HGTV thing. Is that the way?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Christopher Connor (Executives)】\nThat's exactly right.\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Morikis (Executives)】\nThat's right.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gregory Melich (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then second, I think, Sean, you mentioned Global Finishes and Consumer Group were both weaker than expectation. Just, what drove that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Sean Hennessy (Executives)】\nNo, I think -- yes. If -- again, not to be evasive, I think what we prefer to do is wait till we have the actual for the fourth quarter and then give you some more color on that in the next phone call.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gregory Melich (Analysts)】\nCan I ask another question? In your sales guidance for next year, what do you assume for currency?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert Wells (Executives)】\nWe don't see any favorableness in Brazil, slightly favorable. We think that Argentina is going to be negative. And we have -- in Europe, we have it slightly accretive because of the way different things are moving.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gregory Melich (Analysts)】\nSo sort of...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Sean Hennessy (Executives)】\nSo low impact.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gregory Melich (Analysts)】\nBut not a huge impact?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Sean Hennessy (Executives)】\nCorrect.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Christopher Connor (Executives)】\nCorrect.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chris Bottiglieri (Analysts)】\nThis is actually Chris Bottiglieri on for Aram. I have a question on how it's related to the international opportunities. Will this given to Lowe's Mexican, Canadian and even in the Australian JV?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Christopher Connor (Executives)】\nWe might have the opportunity downstream, but today we're just announcing the U.S. program.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chris Bottiglieri (Analysts)】\nGot you. Okay. But if you did go downstream on that, would that be something that you may feel to extend internationally in terms of other home improvement, where the North American ones aren't currently stationed?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Christopher Connor (Executives)】\nThat's perspective there, I am not prepared to comment on that today.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chris Bottiglieri (Analysts)】\nOkay. All right. That's fair. And maybe I can ask one more then. Can you just frame the opportunity? Obviously, this is kind of a second. You haven't traditionally played it in as well. Can you maybe just frame it in terms of the overall segment of the market that you're not currently addressing and how this kind of fits in? The high level math seems to suggest maybe about 25%, but just wanted to see what your thoughts were.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Christopher Connor (Executives)】\nIn terms of how this program fits into a market that we have been previously telling you, is that your question?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chris Bottiglieri (Analysts)】\nWhat is DIY and the home improvement share of DIY?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Christopher Connor (Executives)】\nYes. So obviously, we've been participating in the DIY marketing through our many third-party retailing partners. We have not enjoyed an architectural paint program at -- in the major big-box retailers, and this is an opportunity for us to now be able to enjoy that. So our experience here was good. Our marketing teams know how to address this. So we expect this will be a solid program.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James McCanless (Analysts)】\nI just wanted to follow on that last question, because I think the devil's advocate way of looking at this is that the #2 big-box retailer just got a gift thrown in their lap of one of the best paint brands in the country and in the world. Frame how this works for Sherwin-Williams and what the upside is for you guys, whether it's something today or brand extension down the road. Because other than the revenue and the EPS benefit that you might see in '15, I am struggling to understand why this is a good idea for Sherwin-Williams.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Christopher Connor (Executives)】\nWell, we think, it's a terrific idea for these 3 brands uniquely to become together at this point in time, Jay. HGTV by Sherwin-Williams is a brand that we took on to our stores a number of years ago. In order to give it its full platform and exposure to the DIY consumer, this is the logical extension of it. This has no impact on our expectation of our stores' growth. We continue to have terrific plans in place to expand that network, as you know, by 1,000 locations, primarily focus on expanding our share position against the painting contract or in all the end segments that they participate in. This simply takes another opportunity in a powerful retailing segment than we hadn't been previously playing in to expand this reach. We think this program will be -- will resonate for all the reasons that John talked about, on color and design and attract a new customer to these products and help this retailer expand their share position. Those are the kinds of things that we do each and every day across all of our brands with all of our segments and important customers. So we think the future will tell the impact. But from right now, we think this is going to be a terrific decision for the company.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James McCanless (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then just wanted to follow up on a comment that John made earlier about certain pros and wanting to buy their paint through the DIY channel. So do you guys expect, does Lowe's expect, a tax rate with that Sherwin-Williams brand name? Or do they expect attach rates to move up? Is that going to help your sales of ancillary products? Can you talk about that a little bit?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Christopher Connor (Executives)】\nYes. So, we've talked for a long time, Jay, about the value of that shopping environment for certain trades, like remodelers, handymen, property management firms that are purchasing a whole host of products to maintain their properties or run their businesses that can be found in the big-box environment. And we've be very cognizant that, that professional trade does shop in that channel. So this is an opportunity for us with these 2 dedicated professional brands that John mentioned, as well as that would trade up to the HGTV by Sherwin brand as well, to find a product inside that box that can help them with their businesses. So every big-box retailer is focused on supporting their pro initiative, and this is part of a whole program that we're offering to Lowe's to help them do that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Dennis McGill (Analysts)】\nFirst question. John, you made the comment, I think, that you said that the customer -- there were some fundamental differences between the DIY customers, between yourself and Lowe's. I was just wondering if you can maybe elaborate on that a little bit, what you guys see as the key differences?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Morikis (Executives)】\nFirst, I'm speaking to the pro there, but I do think that there are DIY customers as well that prefer to go into a shopping environment where they can purchase a wide variety of products that are available at a home center.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Dennis McGill (Analysts)】\nOkay, fair enough. And then, Chris, I think it's fair to say there's probably no bigger defender of the Sherwin-Williams brand than you, so I commented that internally you guys are very comfortable with how that could impact the stores group. But is there anything, even if it's on the margin and a low probability risk, that you'll be watching or you think could come from the program?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Christopher Connor (Executives)】\nWell, I think, one thing that we expect to happen is we think the HGTV by Sherwin brand inside the Sherwin-Williams stores is going to get a lift. This brand will get tremendous more awareness and recognition and advertising support as a result of this launch. Our stores remain very committed to the program, the color merchandising tool unique to  HGTV brands and we're fully supportive of the initiative going forward. So we see this as a win-win for both sides. As I mentioned on the earlier call to Jay, this doesn't detract, from 1 second, the real drivers of that core business for us, which is, continued expansion, continued focus on the professional painting contractor. None of that changes with this announcement.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Cerankosky (Analysts)】\nIf we look at the stores' sales mix, about 15% of it's DIY. Can you comment on what percent of HGTV paint is DIY, out of the stores right now, over the past 12 months?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Christopher Connor (Executives)】\nYes. So our HGTV sales will be primary DIY sales through our stores, but that's as close as we'll break that down.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Cerankosky (Analysts)】\nOkay. Well, that's fair. Will there be any -- Chris, any -- or John, you might comment on this as well. Will it be any wider quality range of the HGTV brand at Lowe's, as compared to which you're selling in the Sherwin stores?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Morikis (Executives)】\nYes, there is, Chuck. As I mentioned, there'll be a couple of lines going in there, first line in at the good quality and then one above that in the higher quality range.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Cerankosky (Analysts)】\nOkay. I took that to mean -- and I was thinking about the property manager line and the other, the pro painter line. Okay, great.\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Morikis (Executives)】\nThose would be in addition to the HGTV by Sherwin.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Cerankosky (Analysts)】\nAll right. So excellent. And then, Sean, can you give us an idea what the cost split will be between the environmental remediation costs and the load-in cost will be in the fourth quarter? I just know that the total is going to be a little over $21 million, but can you break that down further?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Sean Hennessy (Executives)】\nAnd Chuck, I think we're going to wait for the year-end call, because, as you know, we put the exact number in for the environmental expenses and some of the releases are the -- our financial release data. But suffice to say, I think it goes back to Chris's. It's very close between the titanium dioxide money that we did receive in the fourth quarter and those 2 big onetime hits.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Christopher Perrella (Analysts)】\nMy question on the HGTV. Does the agreement with Lowe's preclude you from offering the HGTV brand at outside of your stores and outside of Lowe's? I know there is probably some exclusive SKUs at Lowe's.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Christopher Connor (Executives)】\nIt does preclude us from taking it anywhere else, yes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Christopher Perrella (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then what sort of cannibalization have you seen from HGTV or expect to see on your Dutch Boy and Pratt & Lambert brands?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Christopher Connor (Executives)】\nWe don't expect to see any cannibalization.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Dmitry Silversteyn (Analysts)】\nI guess, we're still catching here in the morning time frame here. A couple of questions. A lot of my questions have been answered, but I'd like to follow-up on a couple of things. First of all, with respect to the pro paint line, which will be launching at Lowe's, Home Depot in there. And [indiscernible] sort of supporting the pro initiatives, has dedicated some external sales to folks to help shore up the contractors' channel and the pro-channel. Is there going to be any tie-in with these brands into your outside sales force? In other words, is there going to be an incremental effort by your external sales force to now drive  customers into these stores and help support these brands for the pro?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Christopher Connor (Executives)】\nNo, Dmitry. Our current external sales force,  supporting the Sherwin's team, will remain solely  focused on driving painters into the Sherwin paint stores.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Dmitry Silversteyn (Analysts)】\nSo there's going to more incremental sales people you will be adding to support this program within Lowe's?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Christopher Connor (Executives)】\nWe will be adding incremental sales people. You asked that the existing ones we're doing that. But we'll have a new sales service team. It will be aligned with this program to support the program.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Dmitry Silversteyn (Analysts)】\nGot it. Okay. And then sort of following up on an earlier question about the Sherwin-Williams brand and your long-term statement that you don't want to see Sherwin-Williams brand outside of Sherwin-Williams stores, Dutch Boys and Pratt & Lambert. And you have to look long and hard at a label before you a find a Sherwin-Williams brand versus if you're preferring to the brand new offering at Lowe's as HGTV by Sherwin-Williams, so it sounds like it will be a fairly predominant feature of the label, in a sort of building customer loyalty and customer cautiousness. So how does that sort of jive with your earlier resistance to letting go of Sherwin-Williams brands into third-party retailers?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Morikis (Executives)】\nSo the brand that Lowe's will be selling, as you said, is going to be the HGTV by Sherwin-Williams. And while this brand will also be sold through our paint stores, it is distinct from the core Sherwin-Williams branded product line. So that's everything. That is combination of the HGTV and Sherwin-Williams is a very compelling brand appeal. And as I'd also mention that HGTV is well known regarding their design and color expertise, our Sherwin space as far as the product quality. And making that available inside Lowe's, we think makes sense. That is -- there is a distinct difference between that and the brands that will continue to be sold exclusively in the Sherwin-Williams stores.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Christopher Connor (Executives)】\nAnd I might to add to that -- those good comment, Dmitry, that the brand for us is clearly the brand of paint, but it's also the brand of the store and the entire experience that a professional painting contractor finds in a dedicated paint per channel, with a breath of product selection, et cetera. So one SKU of a HGTV by Sherwin in a different channel doesn't disrupt, in our opinion, that trust and relationship that's been built with the pro.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Dmitry Silversteyn (Analysts)】\nOkay, fair enough. And then just one final question. There was another question about sort of the timing of this program and how long you've worked on that. I'll try to ask it a different way. It sounded like, at least from the research we've done, that the reserve at Lowe's and the higher end of products that [indiscernible] put out at the Home Depot sort of have caused a little bit of an attrition from a contractor story, DIY customers, that are now seeing sort of comparable quality products in the big-box channels. So how much of this program is sort of a defensive response to that versus sort of an constant expansion of your channel and really going after new opportunities?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Christopher Connor (Executives)】\nI would say, almost no impact, as a defensive measure. We've shared with you the terrific sales results we've been generating through our stores platform, both on the Pro and the DIY side. This is an opportunity for us to run significant incremental balance through our manufacturing logistics chain and build a powerful brand that we think will help Lowe's and Sherwin-Williams both.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Eric Bosshard (Analysts)】\nTwo things. First of all, the Pro brands that you're introducing at Lowe's, could you characterize the market sector that, that's pursuing in terms of the Pro customer? And then, secondly, you referenced that there will be some salespeople that you'll be allocating a new sales people to sell the product. Can you talk a little bit more specifically of what of product they're aimed at selling and that kind of question, the first question as well?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Morikis (Executives)】\nSure. The products are going to be aimed primarily as the remodelers, the repainting contractors and then also the property managers. And regarding the sales force, as Chris mentioned, we are going to be putting some people to -- that are going to be dedicated as sale and services organization, but we're not at liberty to provide any details on that at this time.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Eric Bosshard (Analysts)】\nWithin that remodel/repaint property manager group, how do you feel your share is there relative to your share of Pros in total? And that's kind of across the overall Sherwin-Williams. What I'm trying to figure out is, is this the segment of customers that Lowe's perhaps can do a better job accessing than you do out of your core stores?  At least relative...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Christopher Connor (Executives)】\nSure. I get it, Eric. So -- sure, I understand the question. If you think about how we shared with you historically, the company's relative share positions against certain contractor segments. For example, the large commercial painting contractors, the new residential painting contractors, those are the positions where the companies had really strong share. When you get into the residential repaint and the remodeler, the share position is at the lower end of our share spectrum. For all the reasons that makes perfect intuitive sense, much larger universe of customers, much smaller in nature and the types of products that purchase to do their businesses can also be found in the home center environment. So our share position will be lower there. That's a pro that goes into the big-boxes to begin with, and now here's a program from Sherwin-Williams that we can help generate some revenue for the company.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Roberts (Analysts)】\nBob, when you said you'll address raw material cost in more detail in January, should we view the current guidance you just gave for 2015 is preliminary, and if raw materials change between now and then, you might update it?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Christopher Connor (Executives)】\nJohn, yes, absolutely. If raw materials change between now and then, it would change our outlook. But we did have an outlook for raw materials baked into these numbers.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Roberts (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then your earnings guidance seems relatively narrow compared to your sales guidance. If you were at the lower end of the sales guidance, would there be less store openings and that might be why it's kind of dampened to downside, if sales are at the low end? And conversely, if you're at the high end, you may open up more stores, which would reduce the earnings effect?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Christopher Connor (Executives)】\nNo, John. I think, that when you take a look it at it, the store, the plan is pretty well set in stone how many stores are going to open. The distribution increases that we're going to have, I think, some of that guidance is going back to the raw materials and so forth, and we'll what we now have with Thompson. And we've taken a position and our view of the raw materials and we'll see how that goes, and there's many out there right now. So we'll see which the raw materials that really drove that widening of the sales versus profit.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Roberts (Analysts)】\nAnd can you just remind me of the Comex assumptions for 2015?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Morikis (Executives)】\nSure. To put something in 2014, we still expect that we're going to lose $0.28 a share, and we expect that $0.08 to $0.13 accretion from that, next year, in 2015.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ivan Marcuse (Analysts)】\nJust a couple of quick ones. Is this program going to require a new plant? Or do you have that volume in your existing manufacturing footprint to supply?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Morikis (Executives)】\nWe have the existing capacity. We'll have some minor issues that will address to help throughput in the plants, but we have existing capacity in our footprint.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Dunn (Analysts)】\nGreat. And then in terms of the sales force or to support this program, how big of an impact will that have on your SG&A costs?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Christopher Connor (Executives)】\nI think, it's baked into our guidance. I don't think we're going to break out SG&A by again by an individual customer.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Richard O'Reilly (Analysts)】\nI just had quick counting of financial reporting question. The onetime items that in the fourth quarter, where will they show up on the income statement, and specifically the TiO2 settlements?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Christopher Connor (Executives)】\nTiO2 will be in our gross margin. So that $21 million will inflate our gross profit, as a percent in dollars this year. The other pieces will be in SG&A. The raw materials, the titanium will be through predominantly the stores group in the consumer segment. The SG&A for the program will be in the consumer segment, and the environmental will be in the administrative segment.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Richard O'Reilly (Analysts)】\nOkay, great. And second question. When you talk about new sales people related to the program, are you talking about in the stores to help the customers or just dealing with Lowe's itself?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Christopher Connor (Executives)】\nYes. Really, at this time, we've been asked not to comment on the roles the sales organization is going to play.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Silke Kueck (Analysts)】\nIt's Silke Valdes. I just have a few follow-ups. One, can you tell us when did you learn that you won the Sherwin-Williams -- I'm sorry, that Sherwin-Williams won the Lowe's business.\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Morikis (Executives)】\nJust recently.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Silke Kueck (Analysts)】\nSo like 2 weeks ago, a week ago?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Christopher Connor (Executives)】\nWe're really not at liberty to discuss that, Silke. We announced it as soon as we were allowed to announce it, on Wednesday evening.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Silke Kueck (Analysts)】\nOkay. And my recollection, as I said, when you do business with Lowe's, like at all product lines if those are like, I don't know, like an annual review period, so is that program with Lowe's, will that come under like annual review? Or can how long you will have the program for?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Christopher Connor (Executives)】\nI would just say that when you take a look at the financial investment we're making, I think that it's significant. Whenever you go in with a program, there is an understanding that there is a period of time that we're going to be -- get a return for our investment.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Silke Kueck (Analysts)】\nAnd when the launch happens in March, will it happen at all of the 1,800 stores or happens it sort of  like in one geographic region and then in another?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Christopher Connor (Executives)】\nYes, Lowe's will be responsible for that rollout. And it will happen, as you explain. It is impossible that over night we can set 1,800 stores. So they will be rolling it out throughout their country on their schedule and then their determination of which market's first.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Silke Kueck (Analysts)】\nDoes it take like a quarter-or-so? Or can you do it in like -- can you it do it faster than that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Morikis (Executives)】\nWe'll be moving as fast as Lowe's would like us to move.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Silke Kueck (Analysts)】\nAnd the last question, I mean -- just like one time I'd like to repeat the material question. If oil prices stayed at $60 a barrel for all of next year, do you think that your 2015 earnings guidance would already reflect that scenario?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Sean Hennessy (Executives)】\nThat's a little too much detail for us to get into on this call, Silke.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Silke Kueck (Analysts)】\nThat sounds like no to me.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Sean Hennessy (Executives)】\nNo, we're not saying that. I mean, we took a call on oil prices also. So we're not going to. We've never talked of what we thought the oil for the year and so forth. So yes, but we have a view of what we think the oil prices will be on average next year.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert Wells (Executives)】\nWell, thanks, again, Jesse. And thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. As always, I will be available this afternoon to answer any additional questions. And we'd all like to thank you for taking the time to participate on the call, and thanks for your continued interest in Sherwin-Williams.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you, Cynthia. Good morning, and thank you for joining our 2015 financial outlook conference call. Please find our presentation for today's call on our website at www.investor.prudential.com. Representing Prudential in today's call are: John Strangfeld, CEO; Mark Grier, Vice Chairman; Charlie Lowrey, Head of International Business; Steve Pelletier, Head of Domestic Businesses; Rob Falzon, Chief Financial Officer; and Rob Axel, Principal Accounting Officer. We will start with prepared comments by John and Rob, and then we will answer your questions.\r\nBefore we begin, please take a look at the slides in the deck that cover forward-looking statements and the non-GAAP measure adjusted operating income. And with that, I will hand it over to John.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Mark. Welcome, everyone, to our 2015 financial outlook presentation. We've chosen this timing a little later than a year ago to enable us to use more current information as we set expectations for the coming year. I will make some opening remarks, hand it over to Rob to walk through the assumptions and factors influencing our 2015 guidance, and then, we'll follow up with concluding comments.\r\nI'll begin on Slide 2. We remain optimistic about our prospects for 2015 and beyond. Our financial strength and capital flexibility, combined with an attractive mix of businesses and strong execution, have enabled us to deliver a return on equity well in excess of industry averages. We've capitalized on organic growth opportunities and supplemented them with good acquisitions that have been effectively integrated. At the same time, we have returned capital to shareholders in a disciplined manner. Share repurchases have exceeded $3 billion since we reinstated our share repurchase program in 2011. And we have steadily increased our dividend from $1.45 in 2011 to an annualized rate of $2.32 presently. Looking forward, we expect increased capital flexibility. The transactions we announced last week to repurchase our Class B shares and redeem the IHC debt of the Closed Block business will simplify our business structure and enhance our financial flexibility. Furthermore, we expect to convert a higher percentage of adjusted operating income into deployable capital. Overall, we are pleased with the positioning of our businesses. And while we can't predict with certainty how markets will evolve or future changes in the competitive landscape, we are confident that the investments we continue to make in our people and businesses will enable us to remain well positioned to deliver value to our stakeholders and customers.\r\nTurning to Slide 3. As you see, our return on equity has increased from about 10% in 2009 and 2010 to over 15% since 2013. This improvement has been driven by a combination of good execution in our core businesses, favorable markets and investment results, as well as effective capital deployment. And while much of the improvement has been driven by factors we believe are sustainable, we have also benefited from tailwinds that cannot be assumed to recur, as Rob will discuss. We continue to believe a 13% to 14% long-term ROE objective is appropriate given our mix of businesses and growth prospects. It is an objective that we set to achieve across the cycle and is set at a level that enables us to invest appropriately in our businesses and infrastructure to facilitate longer-term growth. It also enables us the latitude to capitalize on very good opportunities that might be lower risk yet create attractive value for shareholders that we might otherwise avoid if we were committed to meeting a higher ROE objective.\r\nWith that as the opening, I'll now hand it over to Rob Falzon. Rob?\n\n---\n\nThanks, John. As you've just seen, our results for the first 9 months of this year, as measured by ROE, have been stronger than our long-term objective over a cycle. Many of the items that can affect our reported results in either direction were on the plus side in 2014. I'll true you the major tailwinds and headwinds that have played into our results and how we are thinking about some of those items that can affect the comparison of results going into 2015. The strong U.S. equity markets in 2014 have exceeded our modeled expectations of 6% appreciation and have bolstered the growth of our account values and assets under management, driving higher fees, lower costs of our guaranteed benefits and more favorable amortization factors. As we've called out during each of the first 3 quarters, higher-than-expected returns on non-coupon investments have also contributed to our results, especially in the Retirement business. In addition, we've benefited from more favorable mortality than our average expectations, both in U.S. Individual Life and International Insurance, and from strong Retirement case experience. These tailwinds were partly offset by the impact of sustained low interest rates during 2014. Going into 2015, we are assuming a return to average expectations of the items we've identified as tailwinds for 2014, producing a headwind in the comparison of results. Low interest rates are expected to remain a factor. While we are assuming a modest increase in U.S. interest rates over the course of the year, we expect to continue to reinvest at rates below the yields of general account investments that are rolling off. We are hedging the yen at JPY 91 to the dollar for 2015 compared to JPY 82 for 2014, representing a headwind in the comparison for the nearly half of our earnings in Japan that are yen denominated. And we expect to ramp up investing in technology systems and infrastructure across our businesses. While this impacts our results, we believe these efforts will enhance our competitiveness, lead to operating efficiencies going forward and enable us to be more responsive to enhanced regulatory oversight. We expect to benefit from greater financial flexibility in the coming year, which, over time, should help mitigate the headwinds in the comparison of results that we've identified. Our business momentum is driving solid capital generation. And as John mentioned, we expect a growing proportion of our earnings to translate into capital available for deployment. In addition, the restructuring of the Closed Block business that we announced last week will add to our financial flexibility by freeing up, for general corporate purposes, funds that were essentially trapped in Prudential Insurance.\r\nNow let's move to our earnings guidance for 2015. Turning to Slide 5. Here are some of the key assumptions and considerations that underpin our guidance. Our guidance assumes a 2014 year-end S&P 500 level of 2,020, growing at 6% over the year and ending next year at 2,144. Our International Insurance non-U.S. dollar earnings are fully hedged for 2015 at JPY 91 and KRW 1,120 per dollar. Our interest rate assumptions are based on an averaging of observed forward yield curves. As a benchmark, the 10-year Treasury rate increases just under 3% by the end of 2015. We are expecting an effective tax rate of approximately 27%. We expect our capital deployment to be supported by an increasing ratio of cash flow to adjusted operating income. To be more specific, we are now expecting that about 60% of our after-tax adjusted operating income will become available for deployment over and above the organic growth needs of our businesses. This is an increase from the roughly 50% level that we have experienced historically. This ratio may vary from one year to another, and it is an expectation of an average over a multiyear period. It assumes that AOI and net income generally converge over time. In addition, we expect greater flexibility in terms of readily deployable capital due to our Closed Block business restructuring, which I'll discuss in a moment. Finally, our year-end leverage ratio based on capital debt is expected to be within our 25% target.\r\nSlide 6 walks through our earnings guidance. First, to level set. For the first 9 months of 2014, our earnings per share, excluding items we've identified as market-driven and discrete, was $7.51. Recall that throughout the first 3 quarters, as we've discussed our results, we've called out additional items that tend to fluctuate and were, in the aggregate, tailwinds, as mentioned earlier. Adjusting for the non-run rate items we called out, including favorable mortality and excess non-coupon investment income, as well as similar items that were not significant in any individual quarter but still impact year-to-date results, provides an annualized run rate of $9.25. This simple annualization doesn't fully reflect the inherent quarterly variability in our results and should not be viewed as a projection of our 2014 results. However, we believe this view provides a useful baseline for discussing our 2015 guidance. Starting from this $9.25 annualized baseline, we take into account market factors such as our 6% U.S. equity market growth assumption and the interest rate assumptions that I mentioned earlier. We expect continued fundamental growth in our businesses, including the contribution of several significant pension risk transfer transactions that came onboard in the Retirement business late in 2014. And we expect to benefit from deployment of excess capital in ways that are accretive to our results, including the midyear acquisition of an ownership position in a leading Chilean pension provider that we announced in October. As in the past, we expect to balance our usage of capital between deployment in our businesses based on market opportunities and return to our shareholders. Putting all this together, our 2015 earnings guidance range for baseline adjusted operating income is $9.60 to $10.10 per share.\r\nTurning to Slide 7. Earlier, we talked about headwinds and tailwinds, including equity markets and interest rates. On this slide, you can see the estimated impact to our earnings per share from a plus or minus 10% movement in the equity markets and a plus or minus 100 basis point change in interest rates, assumed in each case to occur at the beginning of 2015 and viewed in isolation. As shown, a 10% move in the equity markets translates to about $0.30 per share in our results, while a 100 basis point change in interest rates, defined as a parallel shift of the yield curve, is worth about $0.20 per share for 2015. I would like to caution that these sensitivities are not necessarily linear and not entirely symmetrical and should not be extrapolated over more severe shock levels in either direction. Nonetheless, they should provide a useful framework to help understand the direction and order of magnitude of 2 of the more important macro assumptions that affect our businesses.\r\nNow taking a look at our estimated year-end capital position on Slide 8. We calculate our on balance sheet capital capacity by comparing the statutory capital position of Prudential Insurance to our 400% RBC ratio target and then adding capital capacity held at the parent company and other subsidiaries. Our year-end 2014 estimate of our capital position gives effect, on a pro forma basis, for the Closed Block restructuring transactions that are expected to close at the beginning of January, as well as the business-as-usual activity we expect during the fourth quarter. When we announced the Closed Block restructuring, we indicated our expectation that the transactions would reduce overall on balance sheet capital capacity because we were using a portion of the surplus and related assets resident in Prudential Insurance to redeem both the IHC debt and the Class B Stock that are supported by those assets. We also indicated that we would see an increase in readily deployable capital because the excess of the surplus and related assets over the cost to redeem those 2 securities becomes available for general corporate purposes. As we reported in our 8-K, the amounts required to redeem the IHC debt and repurchase the Class B Stock total about $2.8 billion or approximately $2.6 billion after taking effect of the make whole pay -- the tax effect of the make whole payments on the debt. The redemptions will be funded by a $2 billion dividend from Prudential Insurance, for which we received approval from the regulators, and by funds available within the intermediate holding company that are not included in the capital position of Prudential Insurance. When we factor in normal fourth quarter activity, the net result is a reduction from about $5 billion of overall on balance sheet capital capacity that we reported as of September 30 to roughly $3.5 billion, as you see here, before our funding of the AFP Habitat Chilean joint venture that is expected to close during 2015. Of the $3.5 billion, we would consider about $3 billion to be readily deployable, an increase of $1.5 billion from September 30. We will continue to manage Prudential Insurance to a capital level that we believe is consistent with AA ratings objectives and estimate that, as of year end, its RBC will exceed our 400% target after giving effect to the Closed Block restructuring. In addition, our capital position assumes a debt-to-capital ratio consistent with our 25% target.\r\nFinally, in Japan, Prudential of Japan and Gibraltar Life are also expected to continue to report strong solvency margins well above our targets.\r\nI'll now turn it back over to John.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Rob. To conclude, on Slide 9. Our expectations for a solid 2015 are led by an attractive business mix and favorable underlying fundamentals that we expect to produce solid baseline earnings per share growth, even if we do not experience the same positive tailwinds we've seen over the last couple of years. And likewise, we believe our business mix and disciplined capital deployment will enable us to produce a return on equity across the cycle of 13% to 14%, representing a healthy premium to industry averages and our cost of equity. Additionally, our capital flexibility is increasing. The Closed Block restructuring adds to our readily deployable capital. And going forward, we expect more of our adjusted operating income to be available to deploy towards outsized organic growth, M&A or capital return.\r\nWith that, I'll turn it back to the operator so we can take your questions.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Mark Finkelstein (Executives)】\nThank you, Cynthia. Good morning, and thank you for joining our 2015 financial outlook conference call. Please find our presentation for today's call on our website at www.investor.prudential.com. Representing Prudential in today's call are: John Strangfeld, CEO; Mark Grier, Vice Chairman; Charlie Lowrey, Head of International Business; Steve Pelletier, Head of Domestic Businesses; Rob Falzon, Chief Financial Officer; and Rob Axel, Principal Accounting Officer. We will start with prepared comments by John and Rob, and then we will answer your questions.\r\nBefore we begin, please take a look at the slides in the deck that cover forward-looking statements and the non-GAAP measure adjusted operating income. And with that, I will hand it over to John.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: John Strangfeld (Executives)】\nThank you, Mark. Welcome, everyone, to our 2015 financial outlook presentation. We've chosen this timing a little later than a year ago to enable us to use more current information as we set expectations for the coming year. I will make some opening remarks, hand it over to Rob to walk through the assumptions and factors influencing our 2015 guidance, and then, we'll follow up with concluding comments.\r\nI'll begin on Slide 2. We remain optimistic about our prospects for 2015 and beyond. Our financial strength and capital flexibility, combined with an attractive mix of businesses and strong execution, have enabled us to deliver a return on equity well in excess of industry averages. We've capitalized on organic growth opportunities and supplemented them with good acquisitions that have been effectively integrated. At the same time, we have returned capital to shareholders in a disciplined manner. Share repurchases have exceeded $3 billion since we reinstated our share repurchase program in 2011. And we have steadily increased our dividend from $1.45 in 2011 to an annualized rate of $2.32 presently. Looking forward, we expect increased capital flexibility. The transactions we announced last week to repurchase our Class B shares and redeem the IHC debt of the Closed Block business will simplify our business structure and enhance our financial flexibility. Furthermore, we expect to convert a higher percentage of adjusted operating income into deployable capital. Overall, we are pleased with the positioning of our businesses. And while we can't predict with certainty how markets will evolve or future changes in the competitive landscape, we are confident that the investments we continue to make in our people and businesses will enable us to remain well positioned to deliver value to our stakeholders and customers.\r\nTurning to Slide 3. As you see, our return on equity has increased from about 10% in 2009 and 2010 to over 15% since 2013. This improvement has been driven by a combination of good execution in our core businesses, favorable markets and investment results, as well as effective capital deployment. And while much of the improvement has been driven by factors we believe are sustainable, we have also benefited from tailwinds that cannot be assumed to recur, as Rob will discuss. We continue to believe a 13% to 14% long-term ROE objective is appropriate given our mix of businesses and growth prospects. It is an objective that we set to achieve across the cycle and is set at a level that enables us to invest appropriately in our businesses and infrastructure to facilitate longer-term growth. It also enables us the latitude to capitalize on very good opportunities that might be lower risk yet create attractive value for shareholders that we might otherwise avoid if we were committed to meeting a higher ROE objective.\r\nWith that as the opening, I'll now hand it over to Rob Falzon. Rob?\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Robert Falzon (Executives)】\nThanks, John. As you've just seen, our results for the first 9 months of this year, as measured by ROE, have been stronger than our long-term objective over a cycle. Many of the items that can affect our reported results in either direction were on the plus side in 2014. I'll true you the major tailwinds and headwinds that have played into our results and how we are thinking about some of those items that can affect the comparison of results going into 2015. The strong U.S. equity markets in 2014 have exceeded our modeled expectations of 6% appreciation and have bolstered the growth of our account values and assets under management, driving higher fees, lower costs of our guaranteed benefits and more favorable amortization factors. As we've called out during each of the first 3 quarters, higher-than-expected returns on non-coupon investments have also contributed to our results, especially in the Retirement business. In addition, we've benefited from more favorable mortality than our average expectations, both in U.S. Individual Life and International Insurance, and from strong Retirement case experience. These tailwinds were partly offset by the impact of sustained low interest rates during 2014. Going into 2015, we are assuming a return to average expectations of the items we've identified as tailwinds for 2014, producing a headwind in the comparison of results. Low interest rates are expected to remain a factor. While we are assuming a modest increase in U.S. interest rates over the course of the year, we expect to continue to reinvest at rates below the yields of general account investments that are rolling off. We are hedging the yen at JPY 91 to the dollar for 2015 compared to JPY 82 for 2014, representing a headwind in the comparison for the nearly half of our earnings in Japan that are yen denominated.

Turning to Slide 5. Here are some of the key assumptions and considerations that underpin our guidance. Our guidance assumes a 2014 year-end S&P 500 level of 2,020, growing at 6% over the year and ending next year at 2,144. Our International Insurance non-U.S. dollar earnings are fully hedged for 2015 at JPY 91 and KRW 1,120 per dollar. Our interest rate assumptions are based on an averaging of observed forward yield curves. As a benchmark, the 10-year Treasury rate increases just under 3% by the end of 2015. We are expecting an effective tax rate of approximately 27%. We expect our capital deployment to be supported by an increasing ratio of cash flow to adjusted operating income. To be more specific, we are now expecting that about 60% of our after-tax adjusted operating income will become available for deployment over and above the organic growth needs of our businesses. This is an increase from the roughly 50% level that we have experienced historically. This ratio may vary from one year to another, and it is an expectation of an average over a multiyear period. It assumes that AOI and net income generally converge over time. In addition, we expect greater flexibility in terms of readily deployable capital due to our Closed Block business restructuring, which I'll discuss in a moment. Finally, our year-end leverage ratio based on capital debt is expected to be within our 25% target.\r\nSlide 6 walks through our earnings guidance. First, to level set. For the first 9 months of 2014, our earnings per share, excluding items we've identified as market-driven and discrete, was $7.51. Recall that throughout the first 3 quarters, as we've discussed our results, we've called out additional items that tend to fluctuate and were, in the aggregate, tailwinds, as mentioned earlier. Adjusting for the non-run rate items we called out, including favorable mortality and excess non-coupon investment income, as well as similar items that were not significant in any individual quarter but still impact year-to-date results, provides an annualized run rate of $9.25. This simple annualization doesn't fully reflect the inherent quarterly variability in our results and should not be viewed as a projection of our 2014 results. However, we believe this view provides a useful baseline for discussing our 2015 guidance. Starting from this $9.25 annualized baseline, we take into account market factors such as our 6% U.S. equity market growth assumption and the interest rate assumptions that I mentioned earlier. We expect continued fundamental growth in our businesses, including the contribution of several significant pension risk transfer transactions that came onboard in the Retirement business late in 2014. And we expect to benefit from deployment of excess capital in ways that are accretive to our results, including the midyear acquisition of an ownership position in a leading Chilean pension provider that we announced in October. As in the past, we expect to balance our usage of capital between deployment in our businesses based on market opportunities and return to our shareholders.

Additionally, our capital flexibility is increasing. The Closed Block restructuring adds to our readily deployable capital. And going forward, we expect more of our adjusted operating income to be available to deploy towards outsized organic growth, M&A or capital return.\r\nWith that, I'll turn it back to the operator so we can take your questions.",
      "transcript_text3": "I had a question about the free cash flow guidance. Can you give us a sense for if -- some more specifics on what drove the increased expectation to 60% versus the historical 50% you had guided to?\n\n---\n\nSure, Ryan. It's Rob. Our expectation for the higher percentage of deployable capital reflects both the mix of our businesses and the evolution of those businesses to a state where they're generating more cash flow. By way of example, our Asset Management business, which is a high cash flow generator, has grown in significance over the last couple of years. And we're benefiting from the cash flow characteristics of the pension risk transfer business in the transactions that we've done in recent years, including this year. In addition, the businesses like Annuities, which were growing more rapidly earlier, have moderated in their growth. And as a result of that, they're generating more cash flow. We've seen, across our businesses, a trend toward generating more deployable capital, and we feel that, that 60% guidance number is now the appropriate number for us to be using, recognizing that it is an average over a multiyear time period.\n\n---\n\nGot it. And then, can you give us any sense of, magnitude wise, the systems and infrastructure type of investments you're making over time? How should we think about the magnitude of that?\n\n---\n\nSure. The -- let me start first by characterizing the investments. First, they're aimed at enhancing or retaining our competitiveness and improving efficiencies, just to make the point that cost savings do emerge on these, but they're not the driver. To answer specifically your question, I would bucket them into 3 areas: the first is systems and processes, which are aimed at improving efficiencies; the second would be technology enhancements to our customer experience and analytics; and the third would be infrastructure for responsiveness to enhanced supervision.\n\n---\n\nCan you just discuss a little bit more how you're thinking about deploying the excess capital? And then just, I guess, is there any level of capital deployment that is assumed in your guidance, kind of, in aggregate for 2015?\n\n---\n\nErik, it's Rob again. I think what you can assume is that we will continue to maintain an appropriate balance between supporting growth, M&A and returning capital to our shareholders. We recently announced a 9% increase in our quarterly dividend, reflecting our confidence in earnings and cash flow and our sensitivity to balancing those 3 constituent uses. Our share repurchase program was authorized by the board in June of this year, and we'll revisit with the board on the topic as appropriate. The level of redeployment and the use of redeployment will -- can vary. And that is, in essence, reflected in the range of guidance that we've given of the $9.60 to $10.10, depending on when and how that capital is redeployed.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And I'm assuming you're not assuming any additional pension risk transfer deals in the guidance, only the -- kind of the completion of the deals announced at this point?\n\n---\n\nErik, this is Steve. We do expect the pension risk transfer market to continue to develop in 2015 because of some of the same drivers we've talked about before: maintenance of healthy funding levels, new mortality tables and increasing PBGC premiums. We saw some of those developments in 2014, where, as Rob mentioned, we announced several deals that, because of their timing, had little benefit in 2014 and will mainly benefit 2015. In terms of new transactions in 2015, well, as I said, we expect the market to continue to develop. And we continue -- we will continue to have a part in that development. Given the inherent difficulty in forecasting this business, either in respect of magnitude or timing, we're not relying on jumbo deals to meet our guidance range.\n\n---\n\nMy first question is, the $3 billion deployable capital figure, does that include any benefit from your capital hedge in -- that you have against the yen?\n\n---\n\nTom, it's Rob. The way the capital hedge works is there's -- there are 2 -- think of it as having 2 components. And if you'd like, we can revisit on this. But there is a mark-to-market on the hedge, and then there are settlements associated with the hedge. Only the settlements actually work their way into our deployable capital. The market on -- the mark-to-market on those hedges are not a component of our readily deployable.\n\n---\n\nAnd Rob, that number, that -- the settlements year-to-date was $350 million, $360 million? Is that right?\n\n---\n\nActually, yes. The settlements year-to-date were probably closer to around $400 million. The mark-to-market on a year-to-date basis was probably close to the number you're thinking about, Tom. It's about $350 million on a -- on a cumulative basis, we've got about $1.1 billion of unrealized gains in those hedges.\n\n---\n\nAnd is that as of the end of 3Q? And if so, have you updated that? Because the yen's weakened pretty considerably since the end of the quarter, as well.\n\n---\n\nYes, that is only as of September 30. Obviously, we can't speak to what's happened post September 30, but you could assume that with -- the historical pattern of the reaction of the mark-to-market and the settlements on those hedges would continue to manifest itself as the yen depreciated further.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then, can you give any color around the core growth expectation that's embedded in your guidance? Whether that's -- which businesses are you assuming better growth from? Any -- can you bracket it between the core growth expectation between the Japanese business versus the U.S. business at all?\n\n---\n\nTom, this is John. Let me start with that. The way we think about this is we really have 3 components of growth. The first is the core growth, meaning the organic piece. The second is step function growth. And then the third is market-related growth. The core growth is, and has been, relatively consistent year-on-year without even getting into the individual lines of business. And from an overall company point of view, that's a pretty consistent experience. The second piece, the step function growth, is, just by its nature, opportunistic and not that easy to foresee. The forms of that can be M&A or -- like a Star/Edison or Hartford, or they can be outsized organic like  pension risk transfer. From our point of view, we tend to think of both the identification of those opportunities and the execution around them as being part of our distinctive competence. We also think we have the capital capacity to pursue them. But by their nature, they're unpredictable, particularly the shorter the time interval you use in terms of how to think about it. And then the third one is the market factors, which Rob's talked about, which are naturally variable in nature. And there are going to be headwinds in some years and tailwinds in others. But overall, our feeling is we've got a good picture. And it's a healthy comparison arising from both relatively predictable core aspects to it, as well as sort of the opportunistic and market overlays that, inevitably, are harder to foresee.\n\n---\n\nTom, it's Rob. I would probably just jump in and add just a couple of thoughts, which is that we don't provide segment-level guidance, but I think you could expect to see a continuation of the recent themes that you've seen in our businesses. We benefit from core organic growth in our Insurance businesses and our Asset Management businesses, while some of our other businesses, like Retirement, can be a little bit more episodic. But as John indicated, we see core growth at a fundamental level across our businesses.\n\n---\n\nGot you. And then just one follow-up overall. And this -- I guess this is a bit of a broader question specific to Japan. I think there's been a considerable increase in concerns over the market becoming a lot more competitive and that it's pressuring both margins and growth for that business for most of the non-Japanese companies that operate over there. Can you talk about whether that's a trend that you're seeing and if that's embedded in your guidance? Or you're not seeing that impact?\n\n---\n\nSure. Tom, this is Charlie. At the risk of seeming a little overly optimistic or naïve, we think our business model will hold. So let me take a little while and explain why. And if we take a step back, we've been in Japan for 25 years. And we've really focused on 3 key aspects of our business. The first, of course, is proprietary distribution. And through that distribution, we've focused on needs-based selling. And by virtue of that, we've focused on the third component, which is Death Protection. And the result's been the creation of an earnings stream comprised mainly of M&E margins or insurance margins and not of investment margin, specifically because we focus on Death Protection and not savings products. And that's led to steady growth and low volatility over about -- over the 25 years we've been there, through the lost decade of stagnation and deflation, through earthquakes and tsunamis, even a nuclear meltdown but, as importantly, through the ups and downs of the yen-dollar rate. So the yen was $1.23, and we tend to forget this, in August 2007 and has gone up and down and was going up and down before that. So you can contrast this to other firms that use either part-time or third-party sales forces selling savings products or third-sector products. And then sales have gotten harder, you're right. Some of these firms are looking outside of Japan. But our strategy couldn't be more different. And it really focuses on proprietary distribution, and that started with the LP model long ago. We expanded that into middle market and affinity groups. And don't forget that the Teachers' group represents 25% of Gibraltar sales, and that's not going away anytime soon. And that enables us to maintain healthy margins as we go forward. The second aspect is, as we did get into some third-party distribution, we did it within a proprietary fashion. So banks have secondees, which are proprietary to us, and we really started that model. And now, with the IA channel, we have proprietary wholesalers. And these 2 channels are additive to us. We're not dependent upon them. They represent maybe 1/3 of our sales, so most of our sales are still from proprietary distribution. So the question is, then, how do we continue to grow in Japan's current economic condition? And I think there are three ways, as we think about it. The first, obviously, is the normal LP and Life Consultant growth. And we've seen some of that growth in both systems. The second, we flagged the inheritance market during our investor call -- or our Investor Day, and we're conducting specific training in both Prudential Japan and Gibraltar to take advantage of this when it -- when the tax rates go up at the beginning of next year. And the third is by increasing our penetration in the third-party distribution markets: one, by the number of agents selling within the institutions by whom we have relationships; and the second is by the number of type of products offered. And we're beginning to make real headway with recurring premium insurance products. So is it easy? Absolutely not. We have a bunch of headwinds. And as we said on Investor Day, we won't enjoy some of the tailwinds. But is this what we've been doing for 25 years? You bet. And that's why we think the business model will hold because, while we are changing and adapting to the market and with the market, we're also holding on to the core attributes of what we think is a non-replicable model that provides us with a sustainable competitive advantage going forward.\n\n---\n\nAnd Tom, it's Rob again. Let me jump in and just finish off the Japan story with sort of 2 other observations. The first is, you asked about the value of our hedges earlier. And let me give a sort of a more complete view of that because I think it's important to understand how we're managing that FX risk that we have in the form of our concentration of earnings in yen. First, recall that less than half the earnings are actually yen denominated. We have U.S. dollar and Aussie dollar-related earnings in that business. And our expenses are all yen based, so it means that our earnings coming out of that are less than you might otherwise think in terms of yen exposure. But importantly, we have the income hedge, and I know the market is generally very familiar with that. It's a rolling 3-year income hedge. And we've married that with an equity hedge, the notional value of which is about $14 billion. And the overall theory is that, that hedge generates assets in a yen weakening environment that can be deployed to mitigate the earnings and ROE impacts of that depreciation of the yen. And we, in fact, calibrate the equity hedge that -- such that, in conjunction with our income hedges, it achieves that outcome. So that $14 billion that has $1.1 billion of unrealized gains in it, those gains, as they're realized, as they settle, become available for us to invest at a return, which will allow us to replace the earnings that we've lost by virtue of the depreciation in the yen. And we think that, that will work effectively to the benefit of shareholders going forward to mitigate any yen exposure that we've got. The second thing I want to highlight is that we've undertaken some structural changes within our Japan operations that will largely mitigate the GAAP-driven volatility in net income and book value from FX remeasurement on a go-forward basis but commencing in the first quarter of 2015. So we will have a noisy fourth quarter by virtue of the ongoing depreciation of the yen, but that restructuring will then substantially mitigate that beginning in 2015.\n\n---\n\nThat was helpful from both Charlie and Rob. Just one last quick follow-up. Rob, what are -- this capital hedge, how long has this been in place for? And have you significantly grown or reduced it in size in response to the recent movement in changes in currency?\n\n---\n\nSo the hedge has been in place for several years. I want to say it goes back to 2000 -- earlier than 2010. I don't remember when we first began -- Mark -- it was a lot earlier.\n\n---\n\nIt was a different policy approach, but we've had a structural short yen on the balance sheet, meaning U.S. dollars in assets funded with yen liabilities. And that actually goes back to more like 2003.\n\n---\n\nThank you. What happened in around 2010 is that we began to calibrate that in a way that we -- that I just described to you, which is we began to be more disciplined around the size of that hedge against the economic value that we were getting out of Japan such that we could replace the ROE and earnings in the way that I just described it. And so the answer to your question is, yes, we're adjusting that all the time to reflect both the change in the yen and the change in the earning -- yen-based earnings that are coming out of our business. And during the course of this year -- or between last year and this year, that has gone up by a couple of billion dollars.\n\n---\n\nBut maybe just one qualifier. It's not a trading position. So when we talk about current circumstances, we're calibrating and implementing around a more structural theme related to the value of the franchise in Japan as opposed to a view on the yen.\n\n---\n\nI had a question on the Closed Block restructuring deal, specifically how it may be contributing to next year's EPS. And I guess the way I'm thinking about it is that you highlighted $1.5 billion of greater deployable capital, but I believe that there may be even a greater amount of capital that, while not readily deployable, is now generating earnings for common shareholders that wasn't before a part of the Financial Services business. So maybe if you could help us think about how much that capital position is and how that may be contributing to common shareholders' earnings per share and what type of return you're assuming?\n\n---\n\nSeth, the way I would -- it's Rob again. The way I would characterize it is that the way we described the available capital for the -- coming out of the Closed Block restructuring, there are no sort of other hidden sources of capital. The $3 billion reflects, fully, the readily deployable that comes out of that transaction. That did come both from PICA and from surplus and related assets that we had outside the insurance company, if that's what you might be referring to. So the full benefit has been reflected in our capital capacity and in the readily deployable. The accretion that results from that, which is some combination of reduced costs and earnings on cash, and then -- and that ultimately -- the redeployment of that capital is reflected in the guidance that we've given. And how it is redeployed will influence whether we're at the higher or lower end of that guidance.\n\n---\n\nOkay. That's helpful. So I suppose my calculations before had been about $2.5 billion of new capital when I think of what was $5.3 billion of statutory resources that I believe were in the Closed Block. And if you subtract out the $2.8 billion that you highlighted, that's how I get to the $2.5 billion. Is that not the right way to think about it?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think the math that you've done, if you look at sort of the capital capacity, that -- if you follow the math that's outlined in the K, there are really only 2 items that you don't have in order to get you to sort of the right number. So if you think about, we started at about $5 billion of on balance sheet capacity. The uses -- all of the surplus and related, substantially the surplus and related that is -- that is which disclosed in the 8-K, was already in our balance sheet capacity numbers because they were in PICA and they were in our RBC calculations. And so what happens is that $5 billion goes down by the use of proceeds that are articulated in the 8-K, which is about $2.5 billion on an after-tax basis. The 2 pieces that you don't have -- or that there are certain surplus and related assets that were not part of our capital capacity is your question you asked earlier, that's about $0.5 billion or so. That gets freed up and gets added to the capacity. And then you've got another about $0.5 billion that, call it, sort of fourth quarter effects because we're benchmarking this off the third quarter. So the combination of those 2 takes that $2.5 billion down to about $1.5 billion. We started at $5 billion. We wind up at around $3.5 billion. That's the math. Now of the $3.5 billion, we estimate that around $3 billion of that is readily deployable because a substantial portion of the net proceeds from that transaction become readily deployable but not all of it.\n\n---\n\nOkay, that's helpful. And one very quick follow-up. Just unrelated, you didn't highlight anything on increases to your own pension expenses for next year. I just wanted to verify that there is no headwind from pension expenses for your own obligation.\n\n---\n\nWell, in fact, Seth, they're -- we built it into our guidance, but yes, there were some headwinds from our pension obligation. The new mortalities tables came out that will be used for GAAP purposes, and we will be reflecting those new mortality tables in our pension liability. That will cause the liability to go up. We're estimating -- I don't want to give any precise numbers, but it's somewhere between -- depending on the finalization of those mortality tables and the review of our liability, it's going to be somewhere between 4% and 7% of that liability will go up as a result of that mortality change. And then that will have to be -- that change in that liability will be amortized in over some period of time. But that's been built into our guidance.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Are you able to help us out in terms of what the EPS impact is there and if it's ongoing or onetime?\n\n---\n\nIt is ongoing in the form of amortization. But no, I don't have a specific EPS impact for you on that.\n\n---\n\nJust wanted to go back to the readily deployable excess capital and make sure I'm thinking about it correctly. So the starting point is $3 billion. I think you said in the past that you normally like to keep $1.5 billion as a buffer, a cushion. And I think you have roughly $600 million for the Chilean acquisition or Chilean investment, I should say. So that would get me to roughly $900 million of readily deployable that is above and beyond the cushion. Is that the right way to think about that?\n\n---\n\nSuneet, it's Rob again. No, actually, your starting point would not be correct. The $1.5 billion you're thinking about is the minimum cash number, largely backed by capital, that we keep available to handle liquidity issues and potential stresses. That is not included in our capital capacity, that is -- or readily deployable. That is actually deducted out of both those numbers. So when we give you a $3 billion number for readily deployable, it is the amount in excess of the $1.5 billion that you're thinking of.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Because I thought, on a prior call, maybe it was Mark said, in normal cases, we like to keep $1.5 billion of -- or we have been running with $1.5 billion of readily deployable. But I guess you're saying that, that's -- I'm mistaken there?\n\n---\n\nWell, we have, in the past, generally said that we would typically be above the bare minimum threshold. But the cushion notion that you're talking about is not as rigid as a rule that we're following.\n\n---\n\nOkay, got it. And then the second question is on -- I guess, a follow-up to Ryan's question on expenses and the multiyear investments that you're making. I think he had asked if you could help us size it. I don't know if you did. I think you gave us the 3 buckets. But should we think about any of those 3 buckets -- well, first, should we think about it as almost split evenly across those 3 buckets? And is there any one that you think -- any one of those buckets that you think will be just an ongoing cost of business for the foreseeable future?\n\n---\n\nWell, they are multiyear. And so for purposes of, I think, this discussion, we should assume that it will repeat year-to-year. I think, if you're looking for quantums on that, the guidance I can give you, if we compare the level of net spending that we're doing in 2015 against the net spending that we did in 2014, it's an increment of about $0.15 a share if that's helpful.\n\n---\n\nOkay, got it. And then just the last definitional question. I mean, I think a lot of these life insurance companies talk about cash flow a little bit differently. So when you're giving us this 60% long-term average as a percentage of operating income, is that before or after holding company expenses, including the dividend?\n\n---\n\nAfter.\n\n---\n\nSo that's after interest expense and dividends?\n\n---\n\nCorrect.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Ryan Krueger (Analysts)】\nI had a question about the free cash flow guidance. Can you give us a sense for if -- some more specifics on what drove the increased expectation to 60% versus the historical 50% you had guided to?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert Falzon (Executives)】\nSure, Ryan. It's Rob. Our expectation for the higher percentage of deployable capital reflects both the mix of our businesses and the evolution of those businesses to a state where they're generating more cash flow. By way of example, our Asset Management business, which is a high cash flow generator, has grown in significance over the last couple of years. And we're benefiting from the cash flow characteristics of the pension risk transfer business in the transactions that we've done in recent years, including this year. In addition, the businesses like Annuities, which were growing more rapidly earlier, have moderated in their growth. And as a result of that, they're generating more cash flow. We've seen, across our businesses, a trend toward generating more deployable capital, and we feel that, that 60% guidance number is now the appropriate number for us to be using, recognizing that it is an average over a multiyear time period.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ryan Krueger (Analysts)】\nGot it. And then, can you give us any sense of, magnitude wise, the systems and infrastructure type of investments you're making over time? How should we think about the magnitude of that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert Falzon (Executives)】\nSure. The -- let me start first by characterizing the investments. First, they're aimed at enhancing or retaining our competitiveness and improving efficiencies, just to make the point that cost savings do emerge on these, but they're not the driver. To answer specifically your question, I would bucket them into 3 areas: the first is systems and processes, which are aimed at improving efficiencies; the second would be technology enhancements to our customer experience and analytics; and the third would be infrastructure for responsiveness to enhanced supervision.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Erik Bass (Analysts)】\nCan you just discuss a little bit more how you're thinking about deploying the excess capital? And then just, I guess, is there any level of capital deployment that is assumed in your guidance, kind of, in aggregate for 2015?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert Falzon (Executives)】\nErik, it's Rob again. I think what you can assume is that we will continue to maintain an appropriate balance between supporting growth, M&A and returning capital to our shareholders. We recently announced a 9% increase in our quarterly dividend, reflecting our confidence in earnings and cash flow and our sensitivity to balancing those 3 constituent uses. Our share repurchase program was authorized by the board in June of this year, and we'll revisit with the board on the topic as appropriate. The level of redeployment and the use of redeployment will -- can vary. And that is, in essence, reflected in the range of guidance that we've given of the $9.60 to $10.10, depending on when and how that capital is redeployed.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Erik Bass (Analysts)】\nOkay. And I'm assuming you're not assuming any additional pension risk transfer deals in the guidance, only the -- kind of the completion of the deals announced at this point?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Pelletier (Executives)】\nErik, this is Steve. We do expect the pension risk transfer market to continue to develop in 2015 because of some of the same drivers we've talked about before: maintenance of healthy funding levels, new mortality tables and increasing PBGC premiums. We saw some of those developments in 2014, where, as Rob mentioned, we announced several deals that, because of their timing, had little benefit in 2014 and will mainly benefit 2015. In terms of new transactions in 2015, well, as I said, we expect the market to continue to develop. And we continue -- we will continue to have a part in that development. Given the inherent difficulty in forecasting this business, either in respect of magnitude or timing, we're not relying on jumbo deals to meet our guidance range.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thomas Gallagher (Analysts)】\nMy first question is, the $3 billion deployable capital figure, does that include any benefit from your capital hedge in -- that you have against the yen?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert Falzon (Executives)】\nTom, it's Rob. The way the capital hedge works is there's -- there are 2 -- think of it as having 2 components. And if you'd like, we can revisit on this. But there is a mark-to-market on the hedge, and then there are settlements associated with the hedge. Only the settlements actually work their way into our deployable capital. The market on -- the mark-to-market on those hedges are not a component of our readily deployable.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thomas Gallagher (Analysts)】\nAnd Rob, that number, that -- the settlements year-to-date was $350 million, $360 million? Is that right?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert Falzon (Executives)】\nActually, yes. The settlements year-to-date were probably closer to around $400 million. The mark-to-market on a year-to-date basis was probably close to the number you're thinking about, Tom. It's about $350 million on a -- on a cumulative basis, we've got about $1.1 billion of unrealized gains in those hedges.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thomas Gallagher (Analysts)】\nAnd is that as of the end of 3Q? And if so, have you updated that? Because the yen's weakened pretty considerably since the end of the quarter, as well.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert Falzon (Executives)】\nYes, that is only as of September 30. Obviously, we can't speak to what's happened post September 30, but you could assume that with -- the historical pattern of the reaction of the mark-to-market and the settlements on those hedges would continue to manifest itself as the yen depreciated further.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thomas Gallagher (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then, can you give any color around the core growth expectation that's embedded in your guidance? Whether that's -- which businesses are you assuming better growth from? Any -- can you bracket it between the core growth expectation between the Japanese business versus the U.S. business at all?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Strangfeld (Executives)】\nTom, this is John. Let me start with that. The way we think about this is we really have 3 components of growth. The first is the core growth, meaning the organic piece. The second is step function growth. And then the third is market-related growth. The core growth is, and has been, relatively consistent year-on-year without even getting into the individual lines of business. And from an overall company point of view, that's a pretty consistent experience. The second piece, the step function growth, is, just by its nature, opportunistic and not that easy to foresee. The forms of that can be M&A or -- like a Star/Edison or Hartford, or they can be outsized organic like  pension risk transfer. From our point of view, we tend to think of both the identification of those opportunities and the execution around them as being part of our distinctive competence. We also think we have the capital capacity to pursue them. But by their nature, they're unpredictable, particularly the shorter the time interval you use in terms of how to think about it. And then the third one is the market factors, which Rob's talked about, which are naturally variable in nature. And there are going to be headwinds in some years and tailwinds in others. But overall, our feeling is we've got a good picture. And it's a healthy comparison arising from both relatively predictable core aspects to it, as well as sort of the opportunistic and market overlays that, inevitably, are harder to foresee.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert Falzon (Executives)】\nTom, it's Rob. I would probably just jump in and add just a couple of thoughts, which is that we don't provide segment-level guidance, but I think you could expect to see a continuation of the recent themes that you've seen in our businesses. We benefit from core organic growth in our Insurance businesses and our Asset Management businesses, while some of our other businesses, like Retirement, can be a little bit more episodic. But as John indicated, we see core growth at a fundamental level across our businesses.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thomas Gallagher (Analysts)】\nGot you. And then just one follow-up overall. And this -- I guess this is a bit of a broader question specific to Japan. I think there's been a considerable increase in concerns over the market becoming a lot more competitive and that it's pressuring both margins and growth for that business for most of the non-Japanese companies that operate over there. Can you talk about whether that's a trend that you're seeing and if that's embedded in your guidance? Or you're not seeing that impact?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Lowrey (Executives)】\nSure. Tom, this is Charlie. At the risk of seeming a little overly optimistic or naïve, we think our business model will hold. So let me take a little while and explain why. And if we take a step back, we've been in Japan for 25 years. And we've really focused on 3 key aspects of our business. The first, of course, is proprietary distribution. And through that distribution, we've focused on needs-based selling. And by virtue of that, we've focused on the third component, which is Death Protection. And the result's been the creation of an earnings stream comprised mainly of M&E margins or insurance margins and not of investment margin, specifically because we focus on Death Protection and not savings products. And that's led to steady growth and low volatility over about -- over the 25 years we've been there, through the lost decade of stagnation and deflation, through earthquakes and tsunamis, even a nuclear meltdown but, as importantly, through the ups and downs of the yen-dollar rate. So the yen was $1.23, and we tend to forget this, in August 2007 and has gone up and down and was going up and down before that. So you can contrast this to other firms that use either part-time or third-party sales forces selling savings products or third-sector products. And then sales have gotten harder, you're right. Some of these firms are looking outside of Japan. But our strategy couldn't be more different. And it really focuses on proprietary distribution, and that started with the LP model long ago. We expanded that into middle market and affinity groups. And don't forget that the Teachers' group represents 25% of Gibraltar sales, and that's not going away anytime soon. And that enables us to maintain healthy margins as we go forward. The second aspect is, as we did get into some third-party distribution, we did it within a proprietary fashion. So banks have secondees, which are proprietary to us, and we really started that model. And now, with the IA channel, we have proprietary wholesalers. And these 2 channels are additive to us. We're not dependent upon them. They represent maybe 1/3 of our sales, so most of our sales are still from proprietary distribution.

And the third is by increasing our penetration in the third-party distribution markets: one, by the number of agents selling within the institutions by whom we have relationships; and the second is by the number of type of products offered. And we're beginning to make real headway with recurring premium insurance products. So is it easy? Absolutely not. We have a bunch of headwinds. And as we said on Investor Day, we won't enjoy some of the tailwinds. But is this what we've been doing for 25 years? You bet.

So the combination of those 2 takes that $2.5 billion down to about $1.5 billion. We started at $5 billion. We wind up at around $3.5 billion. That's the math. Now of the $3.5 billion, we estimate that around $3 billion of that is readily deployable because a substantial portion of the net proceeds from that transaction become readily deployable but not all of it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Seth Weiss (Analysts)】\nOkay, that's helpful. And one very quick follow-up. Just unrelated, you didn't highlight anything on increases to your own pension expenses for next year. I just wanted to verify that there is no headwind from pension expenses for your own obligation.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert Falzon (Executives)】\nWell, in fact, Seth, they're -- we built it into our guidance, but yes, there were some headwinds from our pension obligation. The new mortalities tables came out that will be used for GAAP purposes, and we will be reflecting those new mortality tables in our pension liability. That will cause the liability to go up. We're estimating -- I don't want to give any precise numbers, but it's somewhere between -- depending on the finalization of those mortality tables and the review of our liability, it's going to be somewhere between 4% and 7% of that liability will go up as a result of that mortality change. And then that will have to be -- that change in that liability will be amortized in over some period of time. But that's been built into our guidance.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Seth Weiss (Analysts)】\nOkay. Are you able to help us out in terms of what the EPS impact is there and if it's ongoing or onetime?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert Falzon (Executives)】\nIt is ongoing in the form of amortization. But no, I don't have a specific EPS impact for you on that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Suneet Kamath (Analysts)】\nJust wanted to go back to the readily deployable excess capital and make sure I'm thinking about it correctly. So the starting point is $3 billion. I think you said in the past that you normally like to keep $1.5 billion as a buffer, a cushion. And I think you have roughly $600 million for the Chilean acquisition or Chilean investment, I should say. So that would get me to roughly $900 million of readily deployable that is above and beyond the cushion. Is that the right way to think about that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert Falzon (Executives)】\nSuneet, it's Rob again. No, actually, your starting point would not be correct. The $1.5 billion you're thinking about is the minimum cash number, largely backed by capital, that we keep available to handle liquidity issues and potential stresses. That is not included in our capital capacity, that is -- or readily deployable. That is actually deducted out of both those numbers. So when we give you a $3 billion number for readily deployable, it is the amount in excess of the $1.5 billion that you're thinking of.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Suneet Kamath (Analysts)】\nOkay. Because I thought, on a prior call, maybe it was Mark said, in normal cases, we like to keep $1.5 billion of -- or we have been running with $1.5 billion of readily deployable. But I guess you're saying that, that's -- I'm mistaken there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Grier (Executives)】\nWell, we have, in the past, generally said that we would typically be above the bare minimum threshold. But the cushion notion that you're talking about is not as rigid as a rule that we're following.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Suneet Kamath (Analysts)】\nOkay, got it. And then the second question is on -- I guess, a follow-up to Ryan's question on expenses and the multiyear investments that you're making. I think he had asked if you could help us size it. I don't know if you did. I think you gave us the 3 buckets. But should we think about any of those 3 buckets -- well, first, should we think about it as almost split evenly across those 3 buckets? And is there any one that you think -- any one of those buckets that you think will be just an ongoing cost of business for the foreseeable future?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert Falzon (Executives)】\nWell, they are multiyear. And so for purposes of, I think, this discussion, we should assume that it will repeat year-to-year. I think, if you're looking for quantums on that, the guidance I can give you, if we compare the level of net spending that we're doing in 2015 against the net spending that we did in 2014, it's an increment of about $0.15 a share if that's helpful.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Suneet Kamath (Analysts)】\nOkay, got it. And then just the last definitional question. I mean, I think a lot of these life insurance companies talk about cash flow a little bit differently. So when you're giving us this 60% long-term average as a percentage of operating income, is that before or after holding company expenses, including the dividend?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert Falzon (Executives)】\nAfter.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Suneet Kamath (Analysts)】\nSo that's after interest expense and dividends?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert Falzon (Executives)】\nCorrect.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are Hock Tan, President and CEO; and Tony Maslowski, Chief Financial Officer of Avago Technologies.\r\nAfter the market closed today, Avago distributed a press release and financial tables describing our financial performance for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2014. If you did not receive a copy, you may obtain the information from the Investors section of Avago's website at www.avagotech.com.\r\nThis conference call is being webcast live, and a recording will be available via telephone playback for 1 week. It will also be archived in the Investors section of our website at avagotech.com.\r\nDuring the prepared comments section of this call, Hock and Tony will be providing details of our fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal year 2014 results, background to our first fiscal quarter 2015 outlook and some commentary regarding the business environment. We will take questions after the end of our prepared comments.\r\nIn addition to U.S. GAAP reporting, Avago reports certain financial measures on a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is included in the tables attached to today's press release. Comments made during today's call will primarily refer to our non-GAAP financial results. Please refer to our press release today and our recent filings with the SEC for information on the specific risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made on this call.\r\nAt this time, I would like to turn the call over to Hock Tan. Hock?\n\n---\n\nThank you, Ashish, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us. We are going to start today by reviewing recent business highlights and then Tony will provide a summary of our fourth quarter and fiscal 2014 financial results.\r\nSo revenue for our fourth quarter was $1.61 billion, an increase of 25% from the prior quarter. The sequential revenue increase was above the upper end of our guidance, which was 18% to 22%. Wireless growth was better than expectations with revenue growing 73% sequentially, driven largely by product ramp of a new smartphone generation at a large OEM. Enterprise Storage also performed significantly better than expected even without considering contribution from our recent acquisition, PLX.\r\nNow before I provide more color on each of our segments, let me quickly provide a short update on the integration of the Avago and LSI operations. As you know, we have completed the sale of 2 non-core businesses, the LSI flash and Axxia businesses, which had annualized operating spend of approximately $200 million. This has been a key contributor to the significant improvement in our operating model. We have also made great progress in extracting synergies from integrating LSI onto the Avago platform. We are now more than halfway through this process and expect to complete the balance of the integration program as we exit our fiscal 2015. Clearly, the financial benefits from the integration program and the divestiture of non-core businesses have been achieved faster than we had originally planned and has definitely given us flexibility to step up R&D investments in certain core businesses.\r\nNow turning to the discussion of our various segments, starting with Wireless. In the fourth quarter, revenue from Wireless was much better than expectations said earlier, growing 73% sequentially. Wireless represented 39% of our total revenue from continuing operations. And on a year-on-year basis, grew 83%. Within the quarter, growth was largely driven by the ramp of a new smartphone generation at the north -- at a large North American smartphone OEM. We also benefited in this from a significant increase in our content.\r\nWe also saw strong double-digit sequential revenue growth from our FBAR-related products across the board and, in particular, from multiple Chinese LTE smartphone OEMs. In fact, over 80% of our Wireless revenue is now FBAR-related, which has driven significant improvements in Wireless gross margins.\r\nNot surprisingly though, we continue to be very capacity constrained even as we have been investing in additional capacity to meet demand. Looking towards first quarter fiscal 2015, we expect sustained demand from our large North American smartphone OEM to mostly offset broad-based seasonal declines from many other global handset OEMs. We're not sure how this will play out in the quarter, so for now we expect Wireless revenue in Q1 fiscal '15 to be flat to perhaps slightly down on a sequential basis.\r\nMoving to Wired Infrastructure, which consists of our SerDes-based ASIC business and our fiber optics business. Here, the Wired segment performed close to expectation in the fourth quarter, with revenue growing 1% sequentially. Wired revenue represented 22% of our total revenue from continuing operations. You may recall, we saw very significant strength in our ASIC business in the third quarter and that strength sustained into this fourth quarter. Overall, ASIC revenue was fairly flat on a sequential basis, with growth in Ethernet switching and routing products largely offset by declines in base station and high-performance computing.\r\nIn fiber optics, we grew moderately from the prior quarter, in particular, with very strong shipments of our 40G -- 40 gigabit, I should say, BiDi fiber products as the customer, the exclusive customer, built up their supply chain to support their new product launch. We also benefited from stronger demand for 16G fibre channel transceivers in storage markets and very strong Fiber to the Home deployment in China. Against this, we see declines in 10 gigabit and other standard transceivers.\r\nLooking forward to first quarter 2015, we expect growth in our ASIC business to resume, partially offset by softness in our fiber optics business. In ASICs, we expect a strong ramp of next-generation LTE base station ASIC at a large Chinese OEM. And we expect a stable enterprise and data center Ethernet switching market. However, in fiber optics, we expect recovery in parallel optic shipments into routers, core routers, to be more than offset, however, by declines from our other Ethernet transceiver products, especially as 40G takes a pause. As a result, we do expect low-single digit sequential revenue growth for our Wired segment.\r\nOn to Enterprise Storage. Here, in this segment, our Enterprise segment -- our Enterprise Storage products include our hard disk drive business and our server and storage connectivity product lines. Starting this fourth quarter, this segment will also include products from our recent PLX acquisitions, which will be part of our server and storage connectivity business. In this fourth quarter, Enterprise Storage revenue, including contribution from PLX, came in stronger than expected and grew 15% sequentially. To provide you with some continuity from the prior quarter, Enterprise Storage revenue without PLX grew 8% sequentially. This segment represented 29% of our total revenues from continuing operations. The HDD or hard disk drive end market had a seasonally strong quarter, with a large increase in Enterprise shipments and our HDD revenue grew mid-single digit sequentially on a percentage basis.\r\nIn server and storage connectivity, we also had a very strong fourth quarter with revenue growing double digits sequentially on a percentage basis. This growth was driven by our server customers staging supply lines in anticipation of a strong tri-annually-driven server refresh cycle, and they accordingly purchased significantly high amount of our 12G SAS and RAID solutions this quarter.\r\nLooking forward to Q1 fiscal '15, we expect data center and enterprise demand to continue driving growth in server and storage connectivity business. We also expect this similar trend to also drive growth in our HDD business. As a result, we expect mid-single digit sequential revenue growth for our Enterprise Storage business.\r\nFinally, moving on to Industrial. Fourth quarter, our Industrial segment performed below expectation with revenue declining by 2% sequentially. Industrial represented 10% of our total revenues from continuing operations. Resales were weaker here than expected in all regions except the Americas, as we saw a cautionary stance from customers in those various other countries. On a sequential basis, in fact, resales in America were up 2%, but declined 9% in Asia-Pacific, 6% in Europe and 13% in Japan. Regardless, our industrial product inventory at our distributors remain very tight. In Q4, we were also expecting some revenue related to a last-time purchase for a legacy program which is now expected to push out to the first fiscal quarter.\r\nAnd looking into the first quarter fiscal of 2015, we expect mid-single-digit decline on a percentage basis in Industrial product revenue due to planned customer shutdowns late half of December. But to be -- however, this we expect to be more than offset by the anticipated last-time buy I referenced earlier. As a result, we expect low- to mid-single digit sequential growth on a percentage basis for Industrial segment.\r\nSo in summary, for Q4 and for fiscal 2015, we have a very strong finish with 25% sequential revenue growth in the fourth quarter, driven by strong growth in Wireless, robust demand in Enterprise Storage, flattish Wired and a small decline in Industrial. For our first fiscal quarter 2015, we are expecting mid-single-digit growth in Enterprise Storage, low- to mid-single-digit growth in Industrial. However, low growth -- low-single-digit growth in Wired, offset by a flat to down Wireless segment. As a result, we expect consolidated revenue growth in the low-single digit sequential growth -- sequentially on a percentage basis.\r\nWith that, let me now turn the call over to Tony for a more detailed review of our fourth quarter and fiscal 2014 financials.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Hock, and good afternoon, everyone. Before reviewing the fourth quarter and fiscal 2014 financial results, I want to remind you that my comments today will focus primarily on our non-GAAP results from continuing operations unless otherwise specifically noted. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP data is included with the earnings release issued today and is also available on our website at www.avagotech.com.\r\nIn prior quarters, we have provided revenue results for our 4 target markets, Wireless, Enterprise Storage, Wired Infrastructure and Industrial & Other. Starting with this quarter and going forward, these 4 target markets will become our reportable segments, aligning our financial reporting with how our management views the business. We will provide certain segment-level results in our SEC filings starting with our upcoming Form 10-K. The business composition of our reportable segments remains the same as previously defined target markets. Please note that our fourth quarter results include contributions from the PLX acquisition, which closed on August 12, 2014.\r\nRevenue of $1.61 billion in the fourth quarter represents an increase of 25% from the prior quarter and came in higher than the upper end of our guidance. Revenue from our Wireless and Enterprise Storage segments came in better than our expectations. The Wired segment performed close to expectations, and we saw weaker-than-expected revenue from the Industrial & Other segment.\r\nFoxconn was a greater than 10% customer in the fourth fiscal quarter. Our fourth quarter gross margin from continuing operations was 58%, which was above our guidance range of 55% to 57%, primarily due to better revenue mix and fab utilization.\r\nTurning to operating expenses. R&D expenses were $214 million and SG&A expenses were $89 million, driving total operating expenses for Q4 to $303 million, $4 million below guidance, primarily because of some anticipated spending in R&D, which is not expected in the first quarter. As a percentage of sales, R&D was 13% and SG&A was 6% of net revenue, respectively.\r\nIncome from operations for the quarter was $636 million and represented 40% of net revenue. Taxes came in at $42 million for the fourth quarter, $4 million above our guidance. This was primarily due to higher income than forecast. Fourth quarter net income was $556 million and earnings per diluted share were $1.99.\r\nFourth quarter interest expense was $54 million. The other income and expense line was $16 million, resulting primarily from gains on the sale of non-core LSI portfolio investments, which had a positive impact on EPS.\r\nOur share-based compensation in the fourth quarter was $49 million. The breakdown of the expense for the fourth quarter include $6 million in cost of goods sold, $19 million in R&D and $24 million in SG&A. In the first quarter fiscal 2015, we anticipate share-based compensation will be approximately $51 million.\r\nJust as a reminder, our definition of non-GAAP net income excludes share-based compensation expense.\r\nMoving on to the balance sheet. Our days sales outstanding were 42 days, an increase from the prior quarter's 39 days, primarily due to linearity of revenue during the quarter. Our inventory ended at $519 million. Days on hand were 70 days, which decreased 9 days from the third quarter as we reduced inventory in our Wireless segment, which had built up in prior quarters to support the strong ramp in fourth quarter shipment.\r\nWe ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.6 billion, and we generated $381 million in operational cash flow. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter, we closed the PLX acquisition, which consumed approximately $308 million in cash, and we closed the sale of our flash business for which we received approximately $450 million in cash. On November 18, 2014, in our first fiscal quarter of 2015, we also closed the sale of the Axxia business and received approximately $650 million in cash.\r\nIn the fourth quarter, we spent $189 million on capital expenditures. For the full year fiscal 2015, we expect CapEx to be approximately $600 million, of which approximately $200 million is expected to occur in the first quarter. As a reminder, our first quarter is generally a weaker quarter for cash generation due to the payment of our annual employee bonuses related to the prior fiscal year.\r\nAs you may recall, last quarter, we mentioned our intent to use a significant amount of our net proceeds from the sales of the flash and Axxia businesses towards paying down a portion of our outstanding term loan before the end of this calendar year. We are still evaluating our capital needs over the next 12 months and, for now, we see investment of these proceeds in the business as a better short-term use of our cash, including potential investment in our internal fab capacity to support continued demand for our Wireless products.\r\nOn September 30, 2014, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.32 per ordinary share, which consumed $81 million of cash. This dividend was raised by $0.03 from the prior quarters. Since the inception of our dividend program in the second quarter of 2011. To-date, our financial performance has allowed us to increase our dividend each quarter. As a reminder, our board reviews and determines our dividend policy on a quarterly basis, based on our financial performance and condition, the contractual provisions related to our outstanding indebtedness and other factors deemed relevant by our board. During the quarter, we did not repurchase any shares.\r\nNow let me briefly recap our fiscal 2014 full year results. Net revenues increased by 71% year-over-year to $4.3 billion, benefiting primarily from 2 quarters of contributions from continuing operations of the LSI businesses as well as strength in our Wireless business. Gross margin increased by 5% year-over-year to 56%, driven by an improvement in product mix, with higher contributions from our FBAR-related wireless products in the classic Avago side, as well as comparatively higher gross margins from the LSI continuing operations. Net income for 2014 increased to $1.343 billion or $4.90 per diluted share as compared to $731 million or $2.89 per diluted share in fiscal 2013.\r\nNow let me turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the first quarter of 2015. This guidance reflects our current assessment of business conditions, and we do not intend to update this guidance. This guidance is for results from continuing operations only.\r\nNet revenue is expected to be flat to up 4% from the fourth quarter. Gross margin is expected to be 57.5%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. Operating expenses are estimated to be approximately $301 million. Taxes are forecasted to be approximately $38 million. Net interest expense and other is expected to be approximately $56 million. And finally, the diluted share count forecast is for 283 million shares.\r\nThat concludes my prepared remark. Operator, please open the call for questions.",

But to be -- however, this we expect to be more than offset by the anticipated last-time buy I referenced earlier. As a result, we expect low- to mid-single digit sequential growth on a percentage basis for Industrial segment.\r\nSo in summary, for Q4 and for fiscal 2015, we have a very strong finish with 25% sequential revenue growth in the fourth quarter, driven by strong growth in Wireless, robust demand in Enterprise Storage, flattish Wired and a small decline in Industrial. For our first fiscal quarter 2015, we are expecting mid-single-digit growth in Enterprise Storage, low- to mid-single-digit growth in Industrial. However, low growth -- low-single-digit growth in Wired, offset by a flat to down Wireless segment. As a result, we expect consolidated revenue growth in the low-single digit sequential growth -- sequentially on a percentage basis.\r\nWith that, let me now turn the call over to Tony for a more detailed review of our fourth quarter and fiscal 2014 financials.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Anthony Maslowski (Executives)】\nThank you, Hock, and good afternoon, everyone. Before reviewing the fourth quarter and fiscal 2014 financial results, I want to remind you that my comments today will focus primarily on our non-GAAP results from continuing operations unless otherwise specifically noted. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP data is included with the earnings release issued today and is also available on our website at www.avagotech.com.\r\nIn prior quarters, we have provided revenue results for our 4 target markets, Wireless, Enterprise Storage, Wired Infrastructure and Industrial & Other. Starting with this quarter and going forward, these 4 target markets will become our reportable segments, aligning our financial reporting with how our management views the business. We will provide certain segment-level results in our SEC filings starting with our upcoming Form 10-K. The business composition of our reportable segments remains the same as previously defined target markets. Please note that our fourth quarter results include contributions from the PLX acquisition, which closed on August 12, 2014.\r\nRevenue of $1.61 billion in the fourth quarter represents an increase of 25% from the prior quarter and came in higher than the upper end of our guidance. Revenue from our Wireless and Enterprise Storage segments came in better than our expectations. The Wired segment performed close to expectations, and we saw weaker-than-expected revenue from the Industrial & Other segment.\r\nFoxconn was a greater than 10% customer in the fourth fiscal quarter. Our fourth quarter gross margin from continuing operations was 58%, which was above our guidance range of 55% to 57%, primarily due to better revenue mix and fab utilization.\r\nTurning to operating expenses. R&D expenses were $214 million and SG&A expenses were $89 million, driving total operating expenses for Q4 to $303 million, $4 million below guidance, primarily because of some anticipated spending in R&D, which is not expected in the first quarter. As a percentage of sales, R&D was 13% and SG&A was 6% of net revenue, respectively.\r\nIncome from operations for the quarter was $636 million and represented 40% of net revenue. Taxes came in at $42 million for the fourth quarter, $4 million above our guidance. This was primarily due to higher income than forecast. Fourth quarter net income was $556 million and earnings per diluted share were $1.99.\r\nFourth quarter interest expense was $54 million. The other income and expense line was $16 million, resulting primarily from gains on the sale of non-core LSI portfolio investments, which had a positive impact on EPS.\r\nOur share-based compensation in the fourth quarter was $49 million. The breakdown of the expense for the fourth quarter include $6 million in cost of goods sold, $19 million in R&D and $24 million in SG&A. In the first quarter fiscal 2015, we anticipate share-based compensation will be approximately $51 million.\r\nJust as a reminder, our definition of non-GAAP net income excludes share-based compensation expense.\r\nMoving on to the balance sheet. Our days sales outstanding were 42 days, an increase from the prior quarter's 39 days, primarily due to linearity of revenue during the quarter. Our inventory ended at $519 million. Days on hand were 70 days, which decreased 9 days from the third quarter as we reduced inventory in our Wireless segment, which had built up in prior quarters to support the strong ramp in fourth quarter shipment.\r\nWe ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.6 billion, and we generated $381 million in operational cash flow. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter, we closed the PLX acquisition, which consumed approximately $308 million in cash, and we closed the sale of our flash business for which we received approximately $450 million in cash. On November 18, 2014, in our first fiscal quarter of 2015, we also closed the sale of the Axxia business and received approximately $650 million in cash.\r\nIn the fourth quarter, we spent $189 million on capital expenditures. For the full year fiscal 2015, we expect CapEx to be approximately $600 million, of which approximately $200 million is expected to occur in the first quarter. As a reminder, our first quarter is generally a weaker quarter for cash generation due to the payment of our annual employee bonuses related to the prior fiscal year.\r\nAs you may recall, last quarter, we mentioned our intent to use a significant amount of our net proceeds from the sales of the flash and Axxia businesses towards paying down a portion of our outstanding term loan before the end of this calendar year. We are still evaluating our capital needs over the next 12 months and, for now, we see investment of these proceeds in the business as a better short-term use of our cash, including potential investment in our internal fab capacity to support continued demand for our Wireless products.\r\nOn September 30, 2014, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.32 per ordinary share, which consumed $81 million of cash. This dividend was raised by $0.03 from the prior quarters. Since the inception of our dividend program in the second quarter of 2011. To-date, our financial performance has allowed us to increase our dividend each quarter. As a reminder, our board reviews and determines our dividend policy on a quarterly basis, based on our financial performance and condition, the contractual provisions related to our outstanding indebtedness and other factors deemed relevant by our board. During the quarter, we did not repurchase any shares.\r\nNow let me briefly recap our fiscal 2014 full year results. Net revenues increased by 71% year-over-year to $4.3 billion, benefiting primarily from 2 quarters of contributions from continuing operations of the LSI businesses as well as strength in our Wireless business. Gross margin increased by 5% year-over-year to 56%, driven by an improvement in product mix, with higher contributions from our FBAR-related wireless products in the classic Avago side, as well as comparatively higher gross margins from the LSI continuing operations. Net income for 2014 increased to $1.343 billion or $4.90 per diluted share as compared to $731 million or $2.89 per diluted share in fiscal 2013.\r\nNow let me turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the first quarter of 2015. This guidance reflects our current assessment of business conditions, and we do not intend to update this guidance. This guidance is for results from continuing operations only.\r\nNet revenue is expected to be flat to up 4% from the fourth quarter. Gross margin is expected to be 57.5%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. Operating expenses are estimated to be approximately $301 million. Taxes are forecasted to be approximately $38 million. Net interest expense and other is expected to be approximately $56 million. And finally, the diluted share count forecast is for 283 million shares.\r\nThat concludes my prepared remark. Operator, please open the call for questions.",
      "transcript_text3": "I was wondering if you could just comment on the Wireless business. You were looking for a very -- a flat guidance. You saw flat guidance last year. I was wondering if you could just, looking at the inventory levels and the ramps, how -- if you had to relate it to a normal seasonal, I know it's hard in Wireless, how would you compare? Then you probably don't want to give guidance for April, but how does it relate as you look into April in terms of normal or not?\n\n---\n\nWell, we don't really have visibility that far out, Blayne, all the way out to April. But we do have pretty clear visibility, frankly, in this Q1 fiscal '15 in terms of backlog from customers, forecast from certain customers. And particularly when you have a fab that's running full, you do get pretty good -- you get very good visibility for the quarter, out that period. So right now, Q1, as we see it, we plan -- we see sustaining the levels pretty much of what we saw in Wireless of Q4. And that's not dissimilar from what we saw a year ago.\n\n---\n\nAnd then just the outlook. The gross margin is very strong in the quarter and the outlook is also very strong. Obviously, you're running your fabs fully utilized, but also adding capacity. I was wondering if you could talk about when do you get back to some normal supply/demand with FBAR? And then if you could just comment on the competitive landscape. Obviously, others are trying to chase this market that's been so good for you in terms of TC-SAW or others pursuing BAW. Can you just comment on both of those?\n\n---\n\nWell, I guess to try to give you -- to try to answer your question in a few -- in a couple of sentences, again, the answer is the demand for, I guess, high-performance filters is the best way to describe it, very high-performance filter, especially into LTE bands, be they China or beyond China is very strong, has been very strong since last quarter. It continues to be extremely strong, particularly with the full launch in late Q4 -- in Q4 -- our Q4 that is, of the next-generation smartphone from the North America -- that certain North American OEM. And that demand has continued -- as far as we see, continues to sustain. So that said, the strong demand for high-performance filters. And we know the competitors out there, be they Ball or on a limited basis, TC, temperature-compensated SAWs. And I mentioned that on a limited basis. Because, obviously, we have our fab full, we can only supply so much for short term. Though our plan to increase the fab will enable us, as time progresses fairly rapidly, to be able to address the markets in a normal basis. But short term, it's not -- for us, the seasonal uptick is not happening, which basically leads some of our -- some certain other customers, potential customers, to perhaps look for alternatives. And they do. Having said that, we believe the performance of our FBAR far surpasses anybody else. And if there's a choice, we do get selected. If not, good enough might do.\n\n---\n\nYour Wireless business for this calendar year, it looks like it will exceed 50%. And Hock, we know that content was a major force behind that. Looking into next year and the platforms that you're designed into, how do you think your content will improve into 2015?\n\n---\n\nWell, the overall trend towards PAD architecture, that's RF architecture using PADs, as you all know, power amplifier duplex modules, that is increasing. The trend towards this will occur more and more and won't be just restricted to any particular phone maker. And the simple reason is simply because while the overall number of phones out there are kind of flattish to maybe single-digit growth, the conversion of feature phones, low-end phones towards smartphones is happening fairly rapidly. And especially smartphones which goes higher and higher end, it requires roaming features, which means you put in bands that are not just unique to a particular local country or carrier, but multiple carriers globally. And the content in every smartphone will have to increase. And so RF components, as we all know, and has been evident the last 12 months, RF component demand has been very strong. And even within RF components, filter demand is particularly strong because while in semiconductor processes or in semiconductor typical trend, you can -- you do -- you can and do integrate chips functionality together. For instance, multiple -- one power amplifier can support multiple modes, multiple bands. In filters, you only -- you need one separate filter for every single band. And as more and more bands enter smartphones, which are expected to roam multiple continents, multiple carriers, the share content of filters in each smartphone will increase, especially when you go 2G, 3G, 4G now and potentially forward in the future. So the trend is towards more and more content increase.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And second question on operating margin. I might have missed it, Tony, but have you -- do you guys have a new long-term target model for operating margin? I think you came in at slightly below 40% this quarter. And the prior target of 28% to 32% feels like it's a bit stale.\n\n---\n\nYes, again, remember, like I said, we're going to update it after we get a couple more quarters under our belt. So it's still a little early for us to kind of do the long-term model. So just...\n\n---\n\nWe don't want to be premature, Romit, okay? I mean, this thing's outrunning us.\n\n---\n\nWell, I mean, I guess tied into that, how do you -- I guess, how do you guys get away with spending 13% of your revenues on R&D? Is it that enterprise networking or Enterprise Storage and Industrial don't require much R&D? Because if I look at some of your networking comparables, nobody is spending less than 20% on R&D. Analog is a little bit better than that, but you could argue the model is different. So maybe you can just talk about R&D here at 13%. Can you sustain that without compromising future growth?\n\n---\n\nWell, let me get your first point first. You think our 13% is too low, right?\n\n---\n\nIt's low compared to most of your networking comparables, most analog companies with the exception of TI, which we would argue is a totally different model.\n\n---\n\nYes, we are. And we are quite totally different model from the rest of the world, too, by the way, Romit. And to answer you seriously, we have a range. We have 4 end markets as you know. And give you a sense, one extreme side, which is Wired or Enterprise -- from the enterprise networking on the ASIC side, especially on SerDes side. Of course, we'll be spending R&D in the mid-20s, really not much different from many of our peers in that area. We do spend there. And then on the other extreme, Industrial, which tends to be very analog, in our case, extremely III-V compound semiconductor analog, not just silicon analog, we spend single digits in R&D of revenue. So -- and the others are somewhere in between. And by -- and so we average out 13%, 14%. A big part of it, frankly, is -- on the standard products we drive in Wireless, as an example, we get huge revenue scale up, a real operating leverage in the -- in specific areas where demand -- the volume is high. So when you look at this range of products we are in and, obviously, Enterprise Storage and Wireless falls in between the extremes of Industrial and networking ASICs, especially, all the rest falls in between, we just average out 13%, 14% R&D spend. And we believe we are spending at a fairly comfortable level because the comment I made at the beginning of my remarks, we are running ahead of our financials, achieving financial synergies with this integration. We're running ahead of it and it's also because of that allows us a lot of flexibility, not that we need that to do it because we always have the habit of reinvesting a lot more even into our core businesses to defend it and strengthen it even more. We have not been -- we have never been cheap about doing it. Where the difference is, if we don't see a business as being core, we divest it. Then we don't spend it anymore. But where the business that are core, believe me, we will invest what we need to continue to lead in technological leadership, which is central to this entire business model.\n\n---\n\nMaybe, Hock, the first one for you. I know you're not guiding to Q2 Wireless. But in general, given the large contribution from your North American customer, do you expect your Wireless segment to show more volatility or more seasonality going forward? Because I'm trying to offset that against some of the content growth you are seeing in China. So the question really is, do you see your Wireless segment being more or less seasonal than before? And if it is more seasonal, what does that do to your FBAR capacity utilization and gross margins?\n\n---\n\nTo be direct, and I made a comment right upfront when I talked about Wireless. We don't know. We don't have that clear visibility. It's -- I like to say that last -- this year repeats from last year. And you know how last year's cycle is. And I guess that's why you're driving this particular question. And so keeping that in mind, I'll answer you this, which by itself tells you something, we don't know. We don't really know. And that's why even in Q1, as we forecast Wireless, and please don't read too much in what I'm trying to tell you then, when I purposely stated in my Q1 -- Wireless for Q1 -- this particular quarter. Right now, our sense is, Wireless is flattish. It could be down slightly, but you're talking about a fairly substantial number either way. And right now, sitting here right now, we think it's flattish. I could be wrong even then, even sitting here right now. And I definitely would be in no position to give you a sense of what Q2 is at this point.\n\n---\n\nGot it. And then as a follow-up, maybe one for you, Tony. Can you remind us what your target debt leverage ratio is? And what do you plan to do with the cash that's coming in and the cash flow that you are generating? I know that you have been increasing your dividend consistently. You are investing in CapEx. But do you see leverage getting to a point where you feel comfortable expanding the buyback plan or considering more M&A? Maybe another home run like an LSI?\n\n---\n\nYes. So just to be very clear that our priorities on cash usage hasn't changed. So it's number one, it's internal investments. And that includes, as Hock mentioned, some of the things that we're opportunistic with or strengthening our product portfolio. Second is really the dividend and then also the debt paydown. And the debt paydown, I want to be clear, is that our leverage ratio at the beginning of the transaction was roughly a little over 3x. And if you look at some of the models you guys have out there, we could end up in the 2s quite easily this year. So really, once we hit around 2x is that when we'll go back to our board and say, “Hey, do we -- I want to change our capital structure and put some longer-term debt on the balance sheet.\" The pause that I talked about in my speech was really just to say, “Hey, we're thinking about it still.\" So think about it more as a one or two quarter pause only in kind of the debt paydown that we're thinking about. And of course, we don't comment on any M&A.\n\n---\n\nOr buyback? Is that also...\n\n---\n\nBuyback is like fourth or fifth.\n\n---\n\nCould we get a little bit more color on the onetime item or nonrecurring item or end-of-life item that's impacting the Industrial sequentials?\n\n---\n\nIt's really -- not really significant, material and in fact, all of the foregoing. We just have to say, it's a onetime nonrecurring thing. It's a last-time buy on a legacy program by a customer, which won't recur. It's just significant enough for Industrial to tweak the thing, which is why I took pains to explain that for Industrial, we expect Q1 to be declining low-single digit sequentially. Instead, with this thing thrown in, becomes increasing single digit sequential. So you can probably guess at the size of the number of this particular item. And I really don't mean it to be anything, to be misleading or anything else. This -- it's just not worth talking about.\n\n---\n\nThat's very helpful. And for a follow-up, understanding you're capacity constrained, the fabs are full. Have the lead times changed meaningfully over the course of the last couple of quarters? Because obviously your business has been terrific for a while now. Are you seeing any change in the lead times or capacity constraints recognizing that you're running full out?\n\n---\n\nAnd you're referring, I assume, just to our FBAR-related products, right, wireless products?\n\n---\n\nCorrect, correct, yes.\n\n---\n\nWe are on product allocation, as we sit here right now. So I guess, yes, the lead times have changed pretty significantly. It has extended up.\n\n---\n\nAnd do you think that's causing -- do you worry at all about double ordering that sometimes happens when folks are on allocation? Or how are you managing that?\n\n---\n\nWell, we are managing that very closely and managing that very tightly because we have pretty good sense for -- one of the benefits is that a lot of our -- a large part of our revenues are coming from a few large guys. And we, believe me, we support these few large guys extremely well. We know what they need precisely. It has also other portion of it that might not be so well managed simply because they're more fragmented. And that's the area, obviously, that we do worry about. It's just our own -- the positive side to it is, it's a relatively set of minority in terms of the size of business rather than the larger part of our business.\n\n---\n\nHock, wanted to switch gears away from Wireless onto the Wired side momentarily. With the combination of your ASIC business with LSIs and then one other big player in that space getting out, I just wanted to see roughly what your expectations are for the growth potential of that business. And has there been any lash back from your customers because the combination of Avago and LSI now can be so dominant?\n\n---\n\nSo let me rephrase, we are not dominant. We're just -- we have a scale now. And we suddenly have scale that allows us to benefit from investing in a lot more capabilities than we had previously. I mean, we -- our claim to fame used to be in Avago, SerDes, we now have very, very strong IP, still in SerDes, but beyond SerDes into memory, embedded processing, all that nice stuff that many of our ASIC customers love to have in communications, wired and wireless infrastructure. That's why we tend to focus our ASIC business in networking, but also wired and wireless infrastructure on a more focused basis, but still very much ASIC. And yes, that business, as I reported over the last couple of quarters, has been growing very nicely. A big part of it, having said that, is product ramps. Product ramps on -- in new generation edge routers, new generation of this software-defined network switches like the Nexus 9000. We're in those very much. We're in couple -- we are in all the edge routers that I'm aware of, almost. And we even have ASIC baseband in one Chinese base station OEM. And all that is driving very nice growth, not huge growth. That's not the nature of this kind of business. But it's more, and best call it, moderate growth. And that's the way we like it. So we do see potential growth opportunity on a very moderate basis that is more sustainable over the next 2, 3 years.\n\n---\n\nGreat. My follow-up question really quickly for Tony is on the OpEx side of things. Can you just remind us where we are in the integration path as far as getting to the $200 million originally you talked about? And I guess the angle I would put on it is more on an absolute basis. At the $301 million you're guiding to, is that the new base off of which we increase or decrease according to revenue? Or do you still have some of those, I guess, after last quarter, 1,100 people that had yet to exit the company and therefore, that would make OpEx actually decline?\n\n---\n\nSo we still have some opportunities for OpEx decline. And remember that the original base was like this $390 million number on the combined company. And so the goal would have been $290 million, but then you got to add in PLX, a couple of million. So really, as Hock mentioned in his speech, we're done with the divestitures, which contributed that $50 million a quarter. And we're probably about, as you can do the math yourself, $40 million toward the $50 million of the other. But as Hock mentioned as well, it gives us great flexibility to beef up other areas of R&D as these final stages happen. So those will happen as we combine the systems, the IT systems, which again is planned for kind of the end of the first half, beginning of the second half of this current fiscal year.\n\n---\n\nThis is Vinayak calling in for Craig. I had a question on gross margin. Gross margins are benefiting from strong growth in FBAR, like are you seeing any benefit or any improvement in other segments of your business as well?\n\n---\n\nAs we mentioned, there are other improvements. We saw -- when we started with the whole LSI acquisition, we're quite surprised that we've seen some upside to their businesses as well. So again, we always focus on FBAR because that's kind of the headline you guys want to hear about. But we also do mention the other things that there's kind of a constant improvement here across most of the divisions.\n\n---\n\nThere are 2 -- there have been -- there were 2 supply chains from 2 companies that is now one single supply chain organization. So that -- that probably, and that -- and we call that manufacturing overhead. That has significantly reduced for the combined company, and that does add to the gross margin improvement.\n\n---\n\nGot it. That's helpful. And my follow-up is on Wired Infrastructure. In your view, right, post LSI, how do you feel about your portfolio when you're trying to attack the ASIC market and fiber optics? And how do you feel about the competitive dynamics in both business?\n\n---\n\nWell, it's good -- this combination, as I mentioned earlier, has given us a lot more capabilities in terms of normal capabilities, lots more IP to offer key customers as we compete for ASIC -- for ASIC programs at major OEMs. And if anything else, you're right, one concern might be customers thinking, with certainly larger and a larger percentage of the ASIC spend, silicon spend. But on the other side, there's a lot of ASSP, FPGA out there that definitely provide very strong competition for us, not just ASICs. And it's just that we are very good at ASICs, and we focus on that. And by natural self-selection, customers wants their own differentiated product fixes. Having more capabilities, obviously, makes us a more formidable competitor, as against the FPGA guys or against standard products. But we do see all the competition out there.\n\n---\n\nAnd if I could dig into a little bit on the $600 million in CapEx. Can you give us some sense of how much capacity addition that is buying you?\n\n---\n\nWell, again, of the $600 million, the majority is going to the continued build out in the FBAR facility and including some of our attempt to go from 8-inch to 12-inch. So again, it's hard -- it's a hard -- it's hard to tell the actual capacity add because, again, depending on the success of that 8 to 12.\n\n---\n\n6 to 8.\n\n---\n\nI'm sorry, 6 to 8, sorry. I apologize. 6 to 8 conversion that we're going through. So again, I think it's difficult to give kind of an exact percentage. These will depend on how successful that is and how quickly that ramps.\n\n---\n\nThere'll be a substantial increase in our capacity. For competitive reasons, we hesitate to give you specifics on that, but it will be a fairly substantial increase in capacity that we will achieve by end of fiscal '15 compared to where we are today.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And if I could for my follow-up, just talking about maybe some of your other businesses. There is a lot of concern in the broader semiconductor market this quarter about linearity of bookings and maybe if you can give us some sense of what you've seen in your other businesses in terms of trends in the overall business and booking patterns. And maybe what you might expect for the quarter you're presently in?\n\n---\n\nWell, a good question. And taking -- moving aside wireless for a second, we still have the rest of our 3 end markets, which are very large. And the best way to describe it is, bookings for those 3 other end markets, which is wired, largely enterprise, enterprise storage and industrial, best description I'll put of it is very stable. It has grown from Q3. Q4 showed a sharp growth, especially late Q3, early Q4 was a sharp ramp in bookings, increase in bookings, stabilized and remain fairly stable.\n\n---\n\nThis is Ryan Carver in for John. Appreciate you taking the question. Can -- not a lot of mention, I think a lot of focus on the Cupertino customer. Can you talk about what you're seeing out of your large Korean customer? I think, obviously, a lot of understanding about their weakness in units kind of end part of this year. Are you seeing any indications as you guys see the January month of any new flagship ramp? And I guess maybe more broadly on that Korean customer, they've talked about potentially reducing SKUs going forward. Does that trend potentially benefit you guys as sort of fewer SKUs are required for you to support, maybe more territories around the world?\n\n---\n\nJohn, I'm loathe to answer that question because we usually don't want to comment on any particular customer. And I appreciate it if you accept that as basically my answer. I've heard about them coming down to lesser SKUs. And that is true, I believe, from all indications I have seen. And they are doing all they can, obviously, to recover ground. And I assure you, they are. And they are very big, important customer, which we love dearly. But other than that, I can't comment anything more than that.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Maybe I can ask a different way. Kind of relative to what is a typical expectation for new product launches seasonally in the first part of the year. Are you guys starting to see any indication of what was normal -- what is a normal sort of seasonal trend for you guys there?\n\n---\n\nOh, well, nothing unusual about that from that Korean customer you're talking about. It's well known that they do 2 large product launches, as you know, on their 2 flagship products of interest to us a year. They do the Galaxy S series in the spring. And they do the Note, the Note series in the fall. And all indications and all our engagements are, they're planning to do exactly that.\n\n---\n\nGot it. Great. If I could squeeze one more in. You mentioned seeing some ASIC ramp within some of the base station customers. Can you comment a little more about the application of those ASICs? I think that there's a general understanding that...\n\n---\n\nFor base station you mean that I was referring to that is helping drive our Q1 revenue in ASIC? Yes, we have an ASIC that is pretty much in the baseband of the base station. It's basically the -- it's a baseband and nothing much more than that, but it's unique and differentiated for that particular customer.\n\n---\n\nThank you, operator. Thank you for participating in today's earnings call. We look forward to talking with you again when we report our first quarter fiscal year 2015 financial results.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Blayne Curtis (Analysts)】\nI was wondering if you could just comment on the Wireless business. You were looking for a very -- a flat guidance. You saw flat guidance last year. I was wondering if you could just, looking at the inventory levels and the ramps, how -- if you had to relate it to a normal seasonal, I know it's hard in Wireless, how would you compare?

But we do have pretty clear visibility, frankly, in this Q1 fiscal '15 in terms of backlog from customers, forecast from certain customers. And particularly when you have a fab that's running full, you do get pretty good -- you get very good visibility for the quarter, out that period. So right now, Q1, as we see it, we plan -- we see sustaining the levels pretty much of what we saw in Wireless of Q4. And that's not dissimilar from what we saw a year ago.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Blayne Curtis (Analysts)】\nAnd then just the outlook. The gross margin is very strong in the quarter and the outlook is also very strong. Obviously, you're running your fabs fully utilized, but also adding capacity. I was wondering if you could talk about when do you get back to some normal supply/demand with FBAR? And then if you could just comment on the competitive landscape. Obviously, others are trying to chase this market that's been so good for you in terms of TC-SAW or others pursuing BAW. Can you just comment on both of those?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hock Tan (Executives)】\nWell, I guess to try to give you -- to try to answer your question in a few -- in a couple of sentences, again, the answer is the demand for, I guess, high-performance filters is the best way to describe it, very high-performance filter, especially into LTE bands, be they China or beyond China is very strong, has been very strong since last quarter. It continues to be extremely strong, particularly with the full launch in late Q4 -- in Q4 -- our Q4 that is, of the next-generation smartphone from the North America -- that certain North American OEM. And that demand has continued -- as far as we see, continues to sustain. So that said, the strong demand for high-performance filters. And we know the competitors out there, be they Ball or on a limited basis, TC, temperature-compensated SAWs. And I mentioned that on a limited basis. Because, obviously, we have our fab full, we can only supply so much for short term. Though our plan to increase the fab will enable us, as time progresses fairly rapidly, to be able to address the markets in a normal basis. But short term, it's not -- for us, the seasonal uptick is not happening, which basically leads some of our -- some certain other customers, potential customers, to perhaps look for alternatives. And they do. Having said that, we believe the performance of our FBAR far surpasses anybody else. And if there's a choice, we do get selected. If not, good enough might do.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Romit Shah (Analysts)】\nYour Wireless business for this calendar year, it looks like it will exceed 50%. And Hock, we know that content was a major force behind that. Looking into next year and the platforms that you're designed into, how do you think your content will improve into 2015?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hock Tan (Executives)】\nWell, the overall trend towards PAD architecture, that's RF architecture using PADs, as you all know, power amplifier duplex modules, that is increasing. The trend towards this will occur more and more and won't be just restricted to any particular phone maker. And the simple reason is simply because while the overall number of phones out there are kind of flattish to maybe single-digit growth, the conversion of feature phones, low-end phones towards smartphones is happening fairly rapidly. And especially smartphones which goes higher and higher end, it requires roaming features, which means you put in bands that are not just unique to a particular local country or carrier, but multiple carriers globally. And the content in every smartphone will have to increase. And so RF components, as we all know, and has been evident the last 12 months, RF component demand has been very strong. And even within RF components, filter demand is particularly strong because while in semiconductor processes or in semiconductor typical trend, you can -- you do -- you can and do integrate chips functionality together. For instance, multiple -- one power amplifier can support multiple modes, multiple bands. In filters, you only -- you need one separate filter for every single band. And as more and more bands enter smartphones, which are expected to roam multiple continents, multiple carriers, the share content of filters in each smartphone will increase, especially when you go 2G, 3G, 4G now and potentially forward in the future. So the trend is towards more and more content increase.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Romit Shah (Analysts)】\nOkay. And second question on operating margin. I might have missed it, Tony, but have you -- do you guys have a new long-term target model for operating margin? I think you came in at slightly below 40% this quarter. And the prior target of 28% to 32% feels like it's a bit stale.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Anthony Maslowski (Executives)】\nYes, again, remember, like I said, we're going to update it after we get a couple more quarters under our belt. So it's still a little early for us to kind of do the long-term model. So just...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hock Tan (Executives)】\nWe don't want to be premature, Romit, okay? I mean, this thing's outrunning us.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Romit Shah (Analysts)】\nWell, I mean, I guess tied into that, how do you -- I guess, how do you guys get away with spending 13% of your revenues on R&D? Is it that enterprise networking or Enterprise Storage and Industrial don't require much R&D? Because if I look at some of your networking comparables, nobody is spending less than 20% on R&D. Analog is a little bit better than that, but you could argue the model is different. So maybe you can just talk about R&D here at 13%. Can you sustain that without compromising future growth?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hock Tan (Executives)】\nWell, let me get your first point first. You think our 13% is too low, right?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Romit Shah (Analysts)】\nIt's low compared to most of your networking comparables, most analog companies with the exception of TI, which we would argue is a totally different model.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hock Tan (Executives)】\nYes, we are. And we are quite totally different model from the rest of the world, too, by the way, Romit. And to answer you seriously, we have a range. We have 4 end markets as you know. And give you a sense, one extreme side, which is Wired or Enterprise -- from the enterprise networking on the ASIC side, especially on SerDes side. Of course, we'll be spending R&D in the mid-20s, really not much different from many of our peers in that area. We do spend there. And then on the other extreme, Industrial, which tends to be very analog, in our case, extremely III-V compound semiconductor analog, not just silicon analog, we spend single digits in R&D of revenue. So -- and the others are somewhere in between. And by -- and so we average out 13%, 14%. A big part of it, frankly, is -- on the standard products we drive in Wireless, as an example, we get huge revenue scale up, a real operating leverage in the -- in specific areas where demand -- the volume is high. So when you look at this range of products we are in and, obviously, Enterprise Storage and Wireless falls in between the extremes of Industrial and networking ASICs, especially, all the rest falls in between, we just average out 13%, 14% R&D spend. And we believe we are spending at a fairly comfortable level because the comment I made at the beginning of my remarks, we are running ahead of our financials, achieving financial synergies with this integration. We're running ahead of it and it's also because of that allows us a lot of flexibility, not that we need that to do it because we always have the habit of reinvesting a lot more even into our core businesses to defend it and strengthen it even more. We have not been -- we have never been cheap about doing it. Where the difference is, if we don't see a business as being core, we divest it. Then we don't spend it anymore. But where the business that are core, believe me, we will invest what we need to continue to lead in technological leadership, which is central to this entire business model.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Vivek Arya (Analysts)】\nMaybe, Hock, the first one for you. I know you're not guiding to Q2 Wireless. But in general, given the large contribution from your North American customer, do you expect your Wireless segment to show more volatility or more seasonality going forward? Because I'm trying to offset that against some of the content growth you are seeing in China. So the question really is, do you see your Wireless segment being more or less seasonal than before? And if it is more seasonal, what does that do to your FBAR capacity utilization and gross margins?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hock Tan (Executives)】\nTo be direct, and I made a comment right upfront when I talked about Wireless. We don't know. We don't have that clear visibility. It's -- I like to say that last -- this year repeats from last year. And you know how last year's cycle is. And I guess that's why you're driving this particular question. And so keeping that in mind, I'll answer you this, which by itself tells you something, we don't know. We don't really know. And that's why even in Q1, as we forecast Wireless, and please don't read too much in what I'm trying to tell you then, when I purposely stated in my Q1 -- Wireless for Q1 -- this particular quarter. Right now, our sense is, Wireless is flattish. It could be down slightly, but you're talking about a fairly substantial number either way. And right now, sitting here right now, we think it's flattish. I could be wrong even then, even sitting here right now. And I definitely would be in no position to give you a sense of what Q2 is at this point.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Vivek Arya (Analysts)】\nGot it. And then as a follow-up, maybe one for you, Tony. Can you remind us what your target debt leverage ratio is? And what do you plan to do with the cash that's coming in and the cash flow that you are generating? I know that you have been increasing your dividend consistently. You are investing in CapEx. But do you see leverage getting to a point where you feel comfortable expanding the buyback plan or considering more M&A? Maybe another home run like an LSI?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Anthony Maslowski (Executives)】\nYes. So just to be very clear that our priorities on cash usage hasn't changed. So it's number one, it's internal investments. And that includes, as Hock mentioned, some of the things that we're opportunistic with or strengthening our product portfolio. Second is really the dividend and then also the debt paydown. And the debt paydown, I want to be clear, is that our leverage ratio at the beginning of the transaction was roughly a little over 3x. And if you look at some of the models you guys have out there, we could end up in the 2s quite easily this year. So really, once we hit around 2x is that when we'll go back to our board and say, “Hey, do we -- I want to change our capital structure and put some longer-term debt on the balance sheet.\" The pause that I talked about in my speech was really just to say, “Hey, we're thinking about it still.\" So think about it more as a one or two quarter pause only in kind of the debt paydown that we're thinking about. And of course, we don't comment on any M&A.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Vivek Arya (Analysts)】\nOr buyback? Is that also...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Anthony Maslowski (Executives)】\nBuyback is like fourth or fifth.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Covello (Analysts)】\nCould we get a little bit more color on the onetime item or nonrecurring item or end-of-life item that's impacting the Industrial sequentials?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hock Tan (Executives)】\nIt's really -- not really significant, material and in fact, all of the foregoing. We just have to say, it's a onetime nonrecurring thing. It's a last-time buy on a legacy program by a customer, which won't recur. It's just significant enough for Industrial to tweak the thing, which is why I took pains to explain that for Industrial, we expect Q1 to be declining low-single digit sequentially. Instead, with this thing thrown in, becomes increasing single digit sequential. So you can probably guess at the size of the number of this particular item. And I really don't mean it to be anything, to be misleading or anything else. This -- it's just not worth talking about.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Covello (Analysts)】\nThat's very helpful. And for a follow-up, understanding you're capacity constrained, the fabs are full. Have the lead times changed meaningfully over the course of the last couple of quarters? Because obviously your business has been terrific for a while now. Are you seeing any change in the lead times or capacity constraints recognizing that you're running full out?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hock Tan (Executives)】\nAnd you're referring, I assume, just to our FBAR-related products, right, wireless products?\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Covello (Analysts)】\nCorrect, correct, yes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hock Tan (Executives)】\nWe are on product allocation, as we sit here right now. So I guess, yes, the lead times have changed pretty significantly. It has extended up.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Covello (Analysts)】\nAnd do you think that's causing -- do you worry at all about double ordering that sometimes happens when folks are on allocation? Or how are you managing that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hock Tan (Executives)】\nWell, we are managing that very closely and managing that very tightly because we have pretty good sense for -- one of the benefits is that a lot of our -- a large part of our revenues are coming from a few large guys. And we, believe me, we support these few large guys extremely well. We know what they need precisely. It has also other portion of it that might not be so well managed simply because they're more fragmented. And that's the area, obviously, that we do worry about. It's just our own -- the positive side to it is, it's a relatively set of minority in terms of the size of business rather than the larger part of our business.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ross Seymore (Analysts)】\nHock, wanted to switch gears away from Wireless onto the Wired side momentarily. With the combination of your ASIC business with LSIs and then one other big player in that space getting out, I just wanted to see roughly what your expectations are for the growth potential of that business. And has there been any lash back from your customers because the combination of Avago and LSI now can be so dominant?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hock Tan (Executives)】\nSo let me rephrase, we are not dominant. We're just -- we have a scale now. And we suddenly have scale that allows us to benefit from investing in a lot more capabilities than we had previously. I mean, we -- our claim to fame used to be in Avago, SerDes, we now have very, very strong IP, still in SerDes, but beyond SerDes into memory, embedded processing, all that nice stuff that many of our ASIC customers love to have in communications, wired and wireless infrastructure. That's why we tend to focus our ASIC business in networking, but also wired and wireless infrastructure on a more focused basis, but still very much ASIC. And yes, that business, as I reported over the last couple of quarters, has been growing very nicely. A big part of it, having said that, is product ramps. Product ramps on -- in new generation edge routers, new generation of this software-defined network switches like the Nexus 9000. We're in those very much. We're in couple -- we are in all the edge routers that I'm aware of, almost. And we even have ASIC baseband in one Chinese base station OEM. And all that is driving very nice growth, not huge growth. That's not the nature of this kind of business. But it's more, and best call it, moderate growth. And that's the way we like it. So we do see potential growth opportunity on a very moderate basis that is more sustainable over the next 2, 3 years.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ross Seymore (Analysts)】\nGreat. My follow-up question really quickly for Tony is on the OpEx side of things. Can you just remind us where we are in the integration path as far as getting to the $200 million originally you talked about? And I guess the angle I would put on it is more on an absolute basis. At the $301 million you're guiding to, is that the new base off of which we increase or decrease according to revenue? Or do you still have some of those, I guess, after last quarter, 1,100 people that had yet to exit the company and therefore, that would make OpEx actually decline?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Anthony Maslowski (Executives)】\nSo we still have some opportunities for OpEx decline. And remember that the original base was like this $390 million number on the combined company. And so the goal would have been $290 million, but then you got to add in PLX, a couple of million. So really, as Hock mentioned in his speech, we're done with the divestitures, which contributed that $50 million a quarter. And we're probably about, as you can do the math yourself, $40 million toward the $50 million of the other. But as Hock mentioned as well, it gives us great flexibility to beef up other areas of R&D as these final stages happen. So those will happen as we combine the systems, the IT systems, which again is planned for kind of the end of the first half, beginning of the second half of this current fiscal year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Vinayak Rao (Analysts)】\nThis is Vinayak calling in for Craig. I had a question on gross margin. Gross margins are benefiting from strong growth in FBAR, like are you seeing any benefit or any improvement in other segments of your business as well?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Anthony Maslowski (Executives)】\nAs we mentioned, there are other improvements. We saw -- when we started with the whole LSI acquisition, we're quite surprised that we've seen some upside to their businesses as well. So again, we always focus on FBAR because that's kind of the headline you guys want to hear about. But we also do mention the other things that there's kind of a constant improvement here across most of the divisions.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hock Tan (Executives)】\nThere are 2 -- there have been -- there were 2 supply chains from 2 companies that is now one single supply chain organization. So that -- that probably, and that -- and we call that manufacturing overhead. That has significantly reduced for the combined company, and that does add to the gross margin improvement.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Vinayak Rao (Analysts)】\nGot it. That's helpful. And my follow-up is on Wired Infrastructure. In your view, right, post LSI, how do you feel about your portfolio when you're trying to attack the ASIC market and fiber optics? And how do you feel about the competitive dynamics in both business?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hock Tan (Executives)】\nWell, it's good -- this combination, as I mentioned earlier, has given us a lot more capabilities in terms of normal capabilities, lots more IP to offer key customers as we compete for ASIC -- for ASIC programs at major OEMs. And if anything else, you're right, one concern might be customers thinking, with certainly larger and a larger percentage of the ASIC spend, silicon spend. But on the other side, there's a lot of ASSP, FPGA out there that definitely provide very strong competition for us, not just ASICs. And it's just that we are very good at ASICs, and we focus on that. And by natural self-selection, customers wants their own differentiated product fixes. Having more capabilities, obviously, makes us a more formidable competitor, as against the FPGA guys or against standard products. But we do see all the competition out there.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Doug Freedman (Analysts)】\nAnd if I could dig into a little bit on the $600 million in CapEx. Can you give us some sense of how much capacity addition that is buying you?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Anthony Maslowski (Executives)】\nWell, again, of the $600 million, the majority is going to the continued build out in the FBAR facility and including some of our attempt to go from 8-inch to 12-inch. So again, it's hard -- it's a hard -- it's hard to tell the actual capacity add because, again, depending on the success of that 8 to 12.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hock Tan (Executives)】\n6 to 8.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Anthony Maslowski (Executives)】\nI'm sorry, 6 to 8, sorry. I apologize. 6 to 8 conversion that we're going through. So again, I think it's difficult to give kind of an exact percentage. These will depend on how successful that is and how quickly that ramps.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hock Tan (Executives)】\nThere'll be a substantial increase in our capacity. For competitive reasons, we hesitate to give you specifics on that, but it will be a fairly substantial increase in capacity that we will achieve by end of fiscal '15 compared to where we are today.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Doug Freedman (Analysts)】\nGreat. And if I could for my follow-up, just talking about maybe some of your other businesses. There is a lot of concern in the broader semiconductor market this quarter about linearity of bookings and maybe if you can give us some sense of what you've seen in your other businesses in terms of trends in the overall business and booking patterns. And maybe what you might expect for the quarter you're presently in?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hock Tan (Executives)】\nWell, a good question. And taking -- moving aside wireless for a second, we still have the rest of our 3 end markets, which are very large. And the best way to describe it is, bookings for those 3 other end markets, which is wired, largely enterprise, enterprise storage and industrial, best description I'll put of it is very stable. It has grown from Q3. Q4 showed a sharp growth, especially late Q3, early Q4 was a sharp ramp in bookings, increase in bookings, stabilized and remain fairly stable.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ryan Carver (Analysts)】\nThis is Ryan Carver in for John. Appreciate you taking the question. Can -- not a lot of mention, I think a lot of focus on the Cupertino customer. Can you talk about what you're seeing out of your large Korean customer? I think, obviously, a lot of understanding about their weakness in units kind of end part of this year. Are you seeing any indications as you guys see the January month of any new flagship ramp? And I guess maybe more broadly on that Korean customer, they've talked about potentially reducing SKUs going forward. Does that trend potentially benefit you guys as sort of fewer SKUs are required for you to support, maybe more territories around the world?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hock Tan (Executives)】\nJohn, I'm loathe to answer that question because we usually don't want to comment on any particular customer. And I appreciate it if you accept that as basically my answer. I've heard about them coming down to lesser SKUs. And that is true, I believe, from all indications I have seen. And they are doing all they can, obviously, to recover ground. And I assure you, they are. And they are very big, important customer, which we love dearly. But other than that, I can't comment anything more than that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ryan Carver (Analysts)】\nOkay. Maybe I can ask a different way. Kind of relative to what is a typical expectation for new product launches seasonally in the first part of the year. Are you guys starting to see any indication of what was normal -- what is a normal sort of seasonal trend for you guys there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hock Tan (Executives)】\nOh, well, nothing unusual about that from that Korean customer you're talking about. It's well known that they do 2 large product launches, as you know, on their 2 flagship products of interest to us a year. They do the Galaxy S series in the spring. And they do the Note, the Note series in the fall. And all indications and all our engagements are, they're planning to do exactly that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ryan Carver (Analysts)】\nGot it. Great. If I could squeeze one more in. You mentioned seeing some ASIC ramp within some of the base station customers. Can you comment a little more about the application of those ASICs? I think that there's a general understanding that...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hock Tan (Executives)】\nFor base station you mean that I was referring to that is helping drive our Q1 revenue in ASIC? Yes, we have an ASIC that is pretty much in the baseband of the base station. It's basically the -- it's a baseband and nothing much more than that, but it's unique and differentiated for that particular customer.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ashish Saran (Executives)】\nThank you, operator. Thank you for participating in today's earnings call. We look forward to talking with you again when we report our first quarter fiscal year 2015 financial results.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you, and good morning, everybody. We appreciate you joining us today to discuss our outlook for 2014 and our initial guidance for 2015. Before we begin, I would like to remind you of our cautionary statements.\r\nThis call will contain forward-looking management comments and other statements, reflecting our outlook for future periods. These comments should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary language contained in this morning's release, as well as the detailed cautionary statements found in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. A copy of this information is available on our website at www.cokecce.com.\r\nThis morning's prepared remarks will be made by John Brock, our CEO; and Nik Jhangiani, our CFO. Hubert Patricot, President of our European Group, is also with us on the call this morning. Following prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions.\r\n[Operator Instructions] Now I'll turn the call over to John Brock.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Thor. And we welcome each of you to our business update, as we discuss our expectations for full year 2014 and our outlook for 2015. Joining me today are Nik Jhangiani, our Chief Financial Officer; and Hubert Patricot, President of our European Group. As you know, throughout the year, we have faced a combination of challenges, including persistent macroeconomic softness and evolving customer landscape and consumer sector and a dynamic competitive environment. These factors have limited our results for 2014 and are expected to continue to impact our results next year. As always, we will continue to focus on efficiency, effectiveness and execution, as we manage each element of our business, our brands, customer service, costs, operating expenses and our balance sheet, all with the goal of reigniting top and bottom line growth, and ultimately, delivering value for our shareowners. A key element of our work is day-to-day executional excellence, an area we continue to focus on at every level of our business, as we support some of the world's most popular brands and meet the evolving needs of our customers and our consumers. \r\nOur portfolio, anchored by our flagship, Coca-Cola trademark brand, includes innovative new products and packages such as Coca-Cola Life, Finley and smartwater, as well as numerous new packages and multi-pack combinations. This type of product and package innovation is essential, as we work to return our company to sustained topline growth. \r\nWe also remain focused on cash generation, as well as the optimization of our capital structure to continue to return cash to shareowners and to drive shareowner value. Since the creation of CCE 4 years ago, we have returned approximately $8 billion to shareowners through share repurchase and dividends, including over $1.1 billion by the end of 2014. We have committed to continue this focus and expect to return at least $850 million to shareowners in 2015 through a combination of share repurchase and dividends. This would represent approximately 8% of our recent market capitalization. As we work to deliver our long-term commitment to shareowner value, we will continue to gauge each business decision, including merger and acquisition opportunities by the value it would create for our shareowners.\r\nNow let's review our outlook for full year 2014. We continue to expect comparable and currency neutral earnings per diluted share growth of approximately 10%. Based on recent rates, currency translation would benefit full year 2014 earnings per diluted share by approximately 3%. We continue to expect net sales for 2014 to be essentially flat, with low single-digit operating income growth, both on a currency, neutral and comparable basis. \r\nLooking forward to 2015, we expect earnings per diluted share to grow in a range of 6% to 8% on a comparable and currency neutral basis. We expect both net sales and operating income to be slightly positive, both, again, on a comparable and currency neutral basis. These objectives reflect the expected impact of ongoing marketplace and macroeconomic challenges and a balanced business plan. \r\nOur plan for 2015 include several key initiatives which include: Building on the popularity of our core brands, including the expansion of Coca-Cola Life across our markets; seizing opportunities in high-growth categories such as Energy; executing against focused marketplace strategies, including brand and pack innovation and expanding our presence in high-value immediate consumption channels; and finally, maximizing our effectiveness, while continuing to provide world-class service to our customers. To build on the advantages of our core brands, we are working closely with The Coca-Cola Company to enhance each aspect of our connection with our customers and our consumers. This includes targeted programs to improve our store by store presence in the marketplace and to build on the connection between consumers and Coca-Cola. In addition, specific brand initiatives will strengthen support of individual core brands, including Coca-Cola Zero, Fanta and Sprite. We will also continue the expansion of new products, such as Coca-Cola Life and Finley, to additional territories. And in the Energy, we will build on our partnership with Monster to accelerate growth in this high-value segment. \r\nWe will also benefit from our support of the Rugby World Cup, which takes place in Great Britain next fall. Our marketplace strategies reflect a broad approach that encompasses both the home market and cold immediate consumption channels. For example, in the home channel, we will implement a price and package diversification strategy that includes new price specific strategies for large PET, new value building multipacks offering additional consumer value, and then specific small basket PET packages and multipack cans. In immediate consumption channels, we will focus on ways to increase visibility and enhance our presence with consumers. This includes more storefront coolers, new vending fronts and more focused activation, outlet by outlet. And finally, we will work to maximize effectiveness, while continuing to fully support our customers with the highest levels of service. This is a broad program that continues to focus on the combination of category planning, shopper insight and supply chain efficiency. At the heart of this effort and at the heart of our day-to-day success, are the employees who work directly with our customers, and who make our success possible. Our goal is to provide the tools, technology and leadership to allow them to maximize their own potential, and in turn, create an even more agile and effective field sales operation. In total, these programs and initiatives are the foundation of our work to return to a level of sustained operating growth that will drive continued increases and shareowner value. To accomplish this, we continue to focus on our 3 strategic priorities: which are centered on leading category growth, excelling at customer service, and driving an inclusive and passionate culture. We also remain fully committed to sustainability. There is a solid business case for our CRS work, particularly at a time when our category and our industry are under scrutiny. \r\nSince 2007, we're on track to reduce our absolute carbon footprint, that is the carbon we use in manufacturing, transportation and cold drinks processes by 25%, significantly outpacing our 15% target. One of the major factors driving this reductions are investment in energy, efficient lines, as well as next generation cold drink equipment, which as seen, our energy use ratio improved by 18% since 2007. Most importantly, we continue to have confidence in our ability to deliver long-term shareowner value. This confidence is based on the strong connection between consumers and our brands and products, the strength of our operating strategies, the skill and dedication of our employees and the resilience of the beverage market. As I mentioned, we also have a solid partnership with The Coca-Cola Company. We are working closely on brand and operating initiatives, all with a goal of executing a shared vision of the future for the Coca-Cola business and our territories. Together, we continue to believe we will achieve sustained value building growth, as we utilize each of these assets to deliver on our most important objective, creating shareowner value. \r\nNow in closing, let me leave you with a few key points. First, we recognize that we need to enable our company to return to the levels of performance that we believe are achievable. It is essential that we adapt and work beyond the impact of the operating headwinds that we will continue to face next year. We are committed to improving our outlook, strengthening our top line results and creating bottom line growth. Second, we will continue generating solid free cash flow, managing our balance sheet and making certain that each investment we make in our business delivers value building returns. And finally, along with restoring growth and generating cash, we will continue to focus on creating shareowner value. Thank you for joining us today.  And now I'll turn it over to Nik, who will provide a more detailed discussion of our financial outlook for 2014 and 2015.\n\n---\n\nThank you, John. We appreciate each of you taking the time to be with us today. First, let's look at our outlook for the remainder of 2014. As John reviewed with you, we have affirmed our guidance for earnings per diluted share, with growth of approximately 10% on a comparable and currency neutral basis. As he highlighted in the release, currency translation would benefit full year 2014 earnings per diluted share by approximately 3%, based on recent rates. We also continue to expect full year net sales to be essentially flat and operating income growth in a low single digit range both -- versus prior year on a comparable and currency neutral basis. Our 2014 free cash flow will total approximately $650 million. We now expect full year 2014 capital expenditures of less than $325 million, reflecting our disciplined capital approach, as well as timing. Weighted average cost of debt is expected to be approximately 3%, and the comparable effective tax rate for 2014 is expected to be approximately 27%. Let me note that given our strong solid free cash flow and our target to be near the midpoint of our net debt to EBITDA range of 2.5x to 3x, we now expect to repurchase $925 million of our shares for the full year. \r\nNow let's look at our expectations for next year. As John discussed, we believe 2015 operating conditions will remain challenging, with soft consumer buying trends and a dynamic competitive environment. These economic and marketplace trends will continue to impact our results and limit our growth, even as we benefit from a continued benign cost environment. As always, however, we remain committed to managing the elements of our business efficiently and utilizing the strength of our balance sheet effectively, all with 1 clear overriding goal: creating shareowner value. After combining these factors into our 2015 business plan, we expect earnings per diluted share to grow in a range of 6% to 8% on a comparable and currency neutral basis. \r\nThough it is very early, currency translation will have a negative impact of approximately 7% on our full year 2015 earnings per diluted share, based on recent rates. We expect both net sales and operating income to be slightly positive, both on a comparable and currency neutral basis. As we look at cost of goods throughout 2014, commodity cost have continued to ease, most notably for PET and sugar. As a result, we now expect a slight decline in our cost of sales per case this year. In 2015, we expect cost of sales per case to be essentially flat. This favorability will continue to allow us some flexibility, as we work to reignite growth and remain competitive in the marketplace. \r\nFor 2015, we expect net sales per case to be slightly above cost of sales per case, enabling some gross margin expansion. Given our focus on reigniting growth and the challenging operating environment, we expect net sales growth to be driven more by volume than pricing next year. As for pricing, annual discussions are currently taking place per our usual timetables, including with our customers in Great Britain and France. While the environment also remains difficult for our customers, we are working with them to combine innovation and solid marketing programs into mutually beneficial plans. Further, we plan to make incremental investments in key areas, including product and package innovation and digital sales. As a result, we expect our operating margin to be flat in 2015. Our work in these areas is ongoing, and we look forward to sharing more details with you as the year progresses. \r\nNow reviewing other 2015 guidance. Our weighted average cost of debt is expected to remain at approximately 3%, and the comparable effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 27% to 28%. As you may note, this is slightly higher than the range in 2014, and primarily reflects the impact of country mix. We will continue to focus on driving cash from operations next year. We expect to achieve free cash flow in a range of $650 million to $700 million. This includes a negative impact of currency translation, which in recent rates, is a mid-single-digit headwind to operating income and cash from operations. Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $325 million to $350 million. We expect to remain within our long term capital target range of 2.5x to 3x net debt to EBITDA. As always, this leverage may be impacted by decisions we make, as we continue to explore ways to best manage the flexibility of our balance sheet. However, absent merger or acquisition activity, we anticipate maintaining this leverage ratio and returning additional cash to shareowners through a combination of dividends and share repurchase. \r\nAs John shared with you, we currently expect to continue share repurchases in 2015, with a target of at least $600 million for the full year. It is important to note that our Board of Directors has authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program. This supports our ongoing commitment to return cash to shareowners. \r\nIn closing, let me share a couple of points. First, we're continuing to work through the significant operating challenges that are limiting our results, and we are seeking ways to improve top and bottom line growth. Second, we continue to drive cash from operations and maximize the utilization of our assets. As we face a tough operating environment that will limit operating income growth, we continue to expect free cash flow to grow meaningfully in 2015, and third, we will sustain our ongoing commitment to shareowner value. Through a combination of share repurchase and dividends, we expect to return approximately 8% of our current market capitalization to shareowners in 2015. \r\nThank you for joining us today, and now, John, Hubert and I will be happy to answer your questions.

We appreciate you joining us today to discuss our outlook for 2014 and our initial guidance for 2015. Before we begin, I would like to remind you of our cautionary statements.\r\nThis call will contain forward-looking management comments and other statements, reflecting our outlook for future periods. These comments should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary language contained in this morning's release, as well as the detailed cautionary statements found in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. A copy of this information is available on our website at www.cokecce.com.\r\nThis morning's prepared remarks will be made by John Brock, our CEO; and Nik Jhangiani, our CFO. Hubert Patricot, President of our European Group, is also with us on the call this morning. Following prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions.\r\n[Operator Instructions] Now I'll turn the call over to John Brock.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: John Brock (Executives)】\nThank you, Thor. And we welcome each of you to our business update, as we discuss our expectations for full year 2014 and our outlook for 2015. Joining me today are Nik Jhangiani, our Chief Financial Officer; and Hubert Patricot, President of our European Group. As you know, throughout the year, we have faced a combination of challenges, including persistent macroeconomic softness and evolving customer landscape and consumer sector and a dynamic competitive environment. These factors have limited our results for 2014 and are expected to continue to impact our results next year. As always, we will continue to focus on efficiency, effectiveness and execution, as we manage each element of our business, our brands, customer service, costs, operating expenses and our balance sheet, all with the goal of reigniting top and bottom line growth, and ultimately, delivering value for our shareowners. A key element of our work is day-to-day executional excellence, an area we continue to focus on at every level of our business, as we support some of the world's most popular brands and meet the evolving needs of our customers and our consumers. \r\nOur portfolio, anchored by our flagship, Coca-Cola trademark brand, includes innovative new products and packages such as Coca-Cola Life, Finley and smartwater, as well as numerous new packages and multi-pack combinations. This type of product and package innovation is essential, as we work to return our company to sustained topline growth. \r\nWe also remain focused on cash generation, as well as the optimization of our capital structure to continue to return cash to shareowners and to drive shareowner value. Since the creation of CCE 4 years ago, we have returned approximately $8 billion to shareowners through share repurchase and dividends, including over $1.1 billion by the end of 2014. We have committed to continue this focus and expect to return at least $850 million to shareowners in 2015 through a combination of share repurchase and dividends. This would represent approximately 8% of our recent market capitalization. As we work to deliver our long-term commitment to shareowner value, we will continue to gauge each business decision, including merger and acquisition opportunities by the value it would create for our shareowners.\r\nNow let's review our outlook for full year 2014. We continue to expect comparable and currency neutral earnings per diluted share growth of approximately 10%. Based on recent rates, currency translation would benefit full year 2014 earnings per diluted share by approximately 3%. We continue to expect net sales for 2014 to be essentially flat, with low single-digit operating income growth, both on a currency, neutral and comparable basis. \r\nLooking forward to 2015, we expect earnings per diluted share to grow in a range of 6% to 8% on a comparable and currency neutral basis. We expect both net sales and operating income to be slightly positive, both, again, on a comparable and currency neutral basis. These objectives reflect the expected impact of ongoing marketplace and macroeconomic challenges and a balanced business plan. \r\nOur plan for 2015 include several key initiatives which include: Building on the popularity of our core brands, including the expansion of Coca-Cola Life across our markets; seizing opportunities in high-growth categories such as Energy; executing against focused marketplace strategies, including brand and pack innovation and expanding our presence in high-value immediate consumption channels; and finally, maximizing our effectiveness, while continuing to provide world-class service to our customers.

In addition, specific brand initiatives will strengthen support of individual core brands, including Coca-Cola Zero, Fanta and Sprite. We will also continue the expansion of new products, such as Coca-Cola Life and Finley, to additional territories. And in the Energy, we will build on our partnership with Monster to accelerate growth in this high-value segment. \r\nWe will also benefit from our support of the Rugby World Cup, which takes place in Great Britain next fall.

As you may note, this is slightly higher than the range in 2014, and primarily reflects the impact of country mix. We will continue to focus on driving cash from operations next year. We expect to achieve free cash flow in a range of $650 million to $700 million.

Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $325 million to $350 million. We expect to remain within our long term capital target range of 2.5x to 3x net debt to EBITDA.

Operator?",
      "transcript_text3": "I guess, Nik, just following up on your comments on gross margin. Is it fair to assume more favorability on that metric earlier in the year and less, as the year progresses?\n\n---\n\nWell, what I would say to you at this point, we're still working through the exact phasing of our quarters and as we finalize our plans, I think we'll share more with you around that in February.\n\n---\n\nOkay. I guess, taking the same metric, different angle, on the flat comps per case outlook, is there any differentiation between sweetener and packaging cost in '15 versus concentrate cost versus -- they're all about flat per case or are there moving parts there?\n\n---\n\nNo. They're definitely moving parts. Again, just as a reminder, if you look at COGS, the first big element is concentrate, and that's about 45% of our COGS. So we work on an incidents model there. We have the agreement in place through the end of '15 and how our 2015 concentrate price increase was determined is really based on the rate that we have realized on a unit case basis, not a physical case. So again, I won't go into too many details on that, but we can go into off-line discussions, but there is an impact in terms of a concentrate price increase. And then if you look at commodities, which you'll know, makes up about 30% of our overall COGS, with about roughly half being pure commodity cost and half being conversion cost, the 2 big elements over there are really around PET and sugar. I would say to you we have similar hedge levels, like we've had about this time last year, and we've built that into our current forecast.\n\n---\n\nOkay. That's very helpful. And then I guess, just lastly, on the capital structure and leverage ratio, you're basically, as outlook implies, I think, a tick up in leverage for '15, and if my math's right, probably towards the higher end of your 2.5x to 3x range. I guess, just maybe some color on how you think about flexibility for M&A in that context. How to think about how far north of the 3.0 level you might be willing to go, before you look at other levers like reducing the buyback or using equity to finance the deal?\n\n---\n\nYes, sure. Well, first, I would say to you, if you look at where we are right now in our calculations, at the end of 2014, we'll be close to the midpoint of our range. So I wouldn't necessarily see a slight pickup. I think it's more just in the rounding, and we remain committed to being within that range and circle around that midpoint. Now if you look at it from a perspective of flexibility around M&A, I think this continues to offer us the flexibility that we need. We have continued to say that we can temporarily go above that range as needed for strategic investment, and I think our credit rating agencies would see that, too. Plus keep in mind, whatever we would do from an M&A perspective would also bring in EBITDA and cash flows. So we might have to pause share repurchase for a period of time, depending on where that is, before we get back to that range, but I don't think that's going to in any way limit our ability to do M&A if it provides strategic opportunity for us.\n\n---\n\nJohn, you mentioned you expect to expand your partnership with Monster next year. So I was hoping you could give us a few more details on this. And then could you remind us what percentage Energy is today of your portfolio? And then what percentage you think it can become in the next couple of years?\n\n---\n\nLet me, Bonnie, make a macro comment, and then I'll ask Hubert to talk a little bit more on some of those details. We're just very excited about the Coca-Cola transaction with Monster and the focus that I think that's going to bring from the Monster team on the Energy category in general. Monster itself is just an outstanding brand, and now having the Monster team in charge of all the energy brands, because we have a multi-brand strategy, which has historically worked very well, I think it will bring even more energy enthusiasm and focus to that category, which is among our fastest growing categories, and again, which remains relatively low compared to the kind of energy development we have in the United States. So we're pleased. We're excited, and I'll have Hubert talk a little bit about some of those specifics.\n\n---\n\nBonnie, as John said, the categories -- energy category continue to be the fastest-growing segment in the NARTD. It's growing 5% in value of this year. We are growing 8%,  so we are gaining share. We think we have the right portfolio and we are now engaged with Monster to see which brand we can expand in other countries, and there is a joint commitment to accelerate on the energy category. So our gross today is 2% to 3% of our volume. It's already more 4% to 5% in revenue, but we're seeing in terms of gross contribution, it can be much bigger in the years to come, and we really think that with Monster and with this new agreement, we have the right platform for continuing growth of energy in the future.\n\n---\n\nI think this is the last year or '15 is the last year of the Business Transformation Program, but still there should be something like $35 million of benefit to come. I just wonder what was happening to that? Is that going to be reinvested? Or should some of that come through to the bottom line?\n\n---\n\nI'll ask Nik to give you a kind of a total description of Business Transportation Program and how it's going.\n\n---\n\nSure. Ian, yes, you're spot on. If you recall, we had talked about the restructuring charge of about $240 million all in, and then the benefit's about $110 million, so roughly 1/3 each. So that is spot on. I would say to you, again, as we look at ways to be able to reignite top line growth, particularly from a price and mix perspective, we will continue to reinvest a significant portion of that back into the business into areas such as digital, innovation, et cetera. So that's been factored into the guidance we provided.\n\n---\n\nThat's very useful, Nik. Look, are there any plans for an extension of that program over the next few years?\n\n---\n\nI think we continue to look at ways to challenge our business model and to pull costs out of our business. I think it would be too early for me to comment on anything more around that, but we will continue to challenge our business model.\n\n---\n\nAnd we also focus on that day in and day out. We have a program called Ownership Cost Management, which is not a specific program like the $200 million plus restructuring program, but it's all about making sure all of our employees and associates around treat the company's money as if it there were their own, and that really is -- it's a way of life. It's part of our culture, and so we constantly are looking at how we can better manage our OpEx, and frankly, it's one of the reasons we've been as successful as we have over the last 3 years in traversing what has been a continuing tough environment, yet, through particularly, our focus on OpEx control, day in and day out, and it's to achieve some respectable results. But as Nik said, we're always looking at are there bigger programs to do? We certainly don't have anything right now that we're ready to talk about, though.\n\n---\n\nAnd just the final question, really, I think if we think about the GB market, from what we hear at the moment, is not so much the quantity of discounting or promotional activity. Perhaps, the debt has gone -- has increased a bit. Do you think that is setting the tone for 2015? Or is that just a little bit of a one-off, ahead of the Christmas period here?\n\n---\n\nHubert, would you like to comment on GB?\n\n---\n\nYes. So the environment remains quite competitive in GB. And as you point out, the Christmas time is always a very intense activity within -- in the stores. A good point for us is, as you know, we launched a new packaging strategy in 2014 by combining the 175, the 125 for frequency and the multipack of our 1.5-liter bottles. And then she's offering us distinct point in market for different pricing, and frankly, we can update and we are building on that for the future. And I'm really pleased to report that after a slow start of this strategy, we are seeing a real traction behind this strategy and our penetration with large PET in GB will have increased this year.\n\n---\n\nSo maybe just following up on Ian's question a bit and just more in the context of your pricing outlook. Obviously, I think your gross margin guidance implies you are going to get a bit more pricing and some of that will flow through the gross margin expansion. As you're having conversation with retailers, both in the U.K. and your other markets, can you just talk about how that's going, your confidence in seeing that pricing in the marketplace? And to what extent does your flat operating margin guidance have some flex, where if the competitive environment does get even worse from here on, that you do have the flexibility to sort of meet that challenge?\n\n---\n\nHubert?\n\n---\n\nYes, Judy, as you know, our tariff negotiation were completed in the Benelux in the third quarter. As you just said, we are now starting our discussion both in France and in GB as usual. I think we are cautiously optimistic, while we approach it, because the context remains challenging for our customer in both countries. However, we think we have a strong program combining what they are looking for, which is also a new product innovation, in tune with shoppers' expectation and strong marketing platform of our program, and John mentioned the Rugby World Cup, which is really important both in GB and France. Obviously, we just have this conversation, and we will share more details when we meet in February. And as you know, talking about flexibility, as the year goes on, promotional programs and business plans may be adjusted to react to marketplace dynamics, as we have done, in fact, this year, utilizing the pricing flexibility we have, thanks to the cost of goods favorability. So we will remain flexible.\n\n---\n\nAnd Judy, I would just add, again, I think, as we've continued to demonstrate, we will continue to look at ways of managing our OpEx base as well as what might potentially, hopefully, be some continued favorability on the COGS line, depending on how oil prices continue to trend. So I would say to you, we will do everything to manage each of the levers of our business to make sure that we can deliver against our commitments.\n\n---\n\nYes. That's fair. I guess it's just on the context of, obviously, this is the first year where we're likely to, based on your guidance, see your OpEx actually step-up more meaningfully. So wanted to just better understand what the nature of those step-up in terms of what the buckets of increases are, how does that sort of differ, as you think about some of those marketplace investments.\n\n---\n\nYes, and I think, quite honestly, it's really about focus around reigniting top line growth because that's ultimately what we need to be driving. So there's a lot of investments around additional programs around innovation. We continue to see digital grow, and as we need to invest in that fear of the world, we do expect that, over time, that will lead to an opportunity to grow top lines. So those are some of the areas that we continue to be focused in on, Judy.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then just my last question, so your expectation about top line growth this year being more volume-oriented, as opposed to pricing oriented, and clearly, the first half of the year, you do have an easier comp in terms of volume. So I know you're not giving us any sort of phasing in terms of the line items. But just thinking about volume expectations, again, sort of lapping that easy comps, would you expect to see better volume pickup more in the earlier part of the year versus later part of the year?\n\n---\n\nWell, again, just on phasing, keep in mind, too, that there will be a bit of an anomaly in terms of our number of days. We'll actually have an extra 4 days in Q1, and that will come out in Q4. So net-net, for the full year, that will be zero. So again, I would say to you, hear your point around the comps. We're actually working, as we finalize our plan, with each of the BUs to make sure they're taken to account the phasing of the days, Easter timing, some of the promotional activity timing, and clearly, we'll give you more of that in February.\n\n---\n\nJust 2 quick ones for me, was wondering if maybe you can provide a little bit of context on Coke Life and some of the early learnings there in terms of are new consumers coming into the category. Is it cannibalizing Diet? So any thoughts there would be helpful. And then the second question is when we think about the guidance for 2015, and certainly, the retail environment is just as bad as the competitive environment across a lot of your territories, with France now going into deflationary territory. So just was wondering if you can give us an update on what's going on at retail and if your guidance really embeds things getting worse at that front.\n\n---\n\nHubert, you want to talk about Coke Life, as well as the retail environment?\n\n---\n\nYes. Nik, we introduced, with The Coca-Cola Company, Coke Life in September, as you remember, both in GB and Sweden, and it is now, in fact, available since test months in France. It's a naturally sweet blend cola with a blend of sugar and stevia with 1/3 less calorie, and this product has been received very well and early indicators from both customers and consumers are positive. And you mentioned cannibalization. Yes, we are experiencing expected level of cannibalization to our other trademark Coca-Cola variants, but net, Coca-Cola Life is contributed gains to our overall Cola portfolio, and the trial rate is really encouraging in both countries. And in fact, in addition of funds, we are planning to expand Coca-Cola Life and to roll out the product in all our territories: Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Norway in the coming months, so starting in 2015.\n\n---\n\nYes, just to add to that, we really, I think, in total, are pleased with the way Coke Life has gone. I think it's been a terrific launch across the board. Hubert and our business units have done an excellent job of end market execution, and -- but because of that, we see expanding it into the balance of our territories, and we think it's going to continue to provide some really exciting levels of consumer choice around a new brand. On the retail environment...\n\n---\n\nYes, retail environment, overall, I guess the economy is slightly improving. But consumer spending, power remains constrained and the arbitrage overall is not generally favorable to food and beverage sales, and our retailers today are navigating through these challenges, and therefore, to some growth areas, like immediate consumption and specking convenience store, convenience format and online sales, as Nik said. And they are also very keen in carrying new product, new innovation, which the shoppers are looking for. And we are partnering with them, reignite the category gross on these areas, and we are just, as we said, working on a joint business plan for the future. It's tough environment, but we see clearly some area for growth.\n\n---\n\nAnd just one further comment. I wouldn't -- I don't -- we wouldn't characterize it as getting worse. I think it's a challenging environment, clearly, as Hubert just said, but we understand and we're working with our major retail customers on those areas where there are clear areas of growth and where we can tie in with them, like convenience, like digital. So yes, it's a very challenging retail landscape. There are pockets of consolidation that are also potentially going to be taking place, but I think we would characterize it more as a continuation of the way it's been rather than getting worse. And frankly, with our kind of category, some real opportunities to work with them on some areas of growth for them, which they need so badly.\n\n---\n\nSo first on the guidance, I was hoping you could maybe clarify what you're assuming for industry growth from a volume and value share perspective. So in other words, you guys are guiding to up slightly from a value perspective. What do you anticipate from an industry growth perspective?\n\n---\n\nAs John said, we are preaching a continuation of what we have seen this year for the industry. So you are talking 1% volume, 1.2, 1.3 in value, but again, with variation to our country, but this is overall the picture, so around the 1%.\n\n---\n\nOkay. All right, that's helpful. And then with respect to the spending behind price. How good do you feel like your visibility is, and in particular, sort of vis-a-vis relative to what the competition may do. So that's part one of the question. And secondarily, how much cushion do you have left in your guidance? Because I guess the prior commentary was that the business transformation spending, which would be 3% to 3.5% contribution to OI, that seems like it's already committed to price investment. So how much flexibility do you sort of have left should the promotional environment get worse?\n\n---\n\nLet me make a comment on the business transformation piece, and then ask Hubert to talk about the price increase. I think we've been pretty consistent since we've started the Business Transformation Program 3 years ago, saying that the principal objectives of it were going to be able to reinvest in the business, and to the degree we had extra funds, we'd use it to de-risk our budget. But the principal plan was to be able to invest significantly in digital and innovation, and honestly, in protecting our license to operate. You'll recall, the debacle we had in France with the excise tax, we, in The Coca-Cola Company and the industry, have really put ourselves in a totally different position today to be ready to deal with those kinds of things. Hubert, of course, is President of UNESDA, which is a major Trade Association in Europe, which has been completely revitalized, and put us in a far stronger position to deal with various kinds of legislative, regulatory or tax threats. And some of the money that we needed to be able to invest in that came from our business transformation programs. So we never really considered that it was going to be a major profit generator. It was really all about digital, innovation and our license to operate, and I think that's clearly -- we're seeing the third year of that in 2015. And as you said, it does gives us a little bit of a cushion in terms of de-risking the budget, but that was not of principal focus of it. Pricing?\n\n---\n\nYes, pricing, it starts as a global joint business plans. We are working with our customers as we engage with them, and we always see and still see the category as growing in value and expendables for both them and us. And we continue, as we said, to see the overall environment to be a bit challenging and competitive. However, what matters to us is to start with the shoppers in each country, and to come with the right tag price architecture, and this is really what we have been doing in the past months and years, and for example, this moment, we are engaging in France and GB. In France, it's really critical to reignite the growth of the value of the category, and this is what we have been doing in this past year and we plan to continue. So yes, taking some pride, building some value in the category in unison with our customers. So again, it's a shopper tag price architecture in each market.\n\n---\n\nAnd technically, I would just characterize our guidance is it's really what we would, for a lack of better word, just say middle-of-the-road. We missed guidance last year, and as John said earlier, we're looking at ways to improve that for this year, too. So we are focused on that. And we're not pleased with where it is, and we'll do everything to try and focus on improving that.\n\n---\n\nNo. I think that makes sense, Nik, and just one more if I may. John, would you care to further your comments at all? You've mentioned pockets of consolidation taking place this year. Would you care to further that at all, even just broadly?\n\n---\n\nI was -- when I talked about consolidation, I was talking about retailers. They're continuing to discuss, and could you comment on...\n\n---\n\nYes, we think consolidation, for example, in Norway, we are the #3 retailer or the #4. You see some purchasing alliance in France. So you see still a trend, which is not totally new news, but a trend for retailer consolidation is going on.\n\n---\n\nSo a couple of things. One is I guess I'm still having trouble with the no leverage between top line growth and operating profit growth on a kind of comparable country neutral basis, especially within the flexibility you're talking about on the business transformation, on, I think, the commodities, to amount of pricing a little bit. And I guess, if it is all being reinvested, maybe so the core of the question, if it is at all being reinvested, we're not really seeing a pickup in your guidance from a top line perspective. So I guess, I'm trying to square the gap there in terms of, if it all is going back into the business, why are we not seeing anything better from a top line perspective than what you're guiding to?\n\n---\n\nSure, I mean, Ali, I think the point here is that we are making investments and this is really for the mid- to long-term. This isn't about make the investment and get the return in the same year. We'd love to see that, again, as I said, and I think John has continued to reiterate, we will continue to look at flexed items to be able to improve some of that leverage as well, and we're hoping some of those will come in our favor. But this is really investments that we're making in areas such as innovation, convenience, which is a growing channel, and we're looking at small basket-sized types of offerings, et cetera. These are things that will come through in the ensuing years. And I would say to you, we are continuing to look at ways to challenge our plans, and we'll continue to update you guys as that changes improve, hopefully, during the course of the year.\n\n---\n\nOkay. From a competitive perspective, can you give us a little bit more on what you're expecting there, and perhaps, how that influences the guidance? But really, what you're expecting from competitors? And the angle I want to ask on is are they, competitors, more levered to the pure commodity cost declines, given your kind of very large and relatively immutable concentrated pricing within your COGS? So would the commodity declines benefit them more than you, and perhaps, put them at a little bit of an advantage in the short term? Or is that not the right way to think about it?\n\n---\n\nYes, I mean, I'm not necessarily sure that's the right way to think about it. Again, if you look at it from an overall COGS perspective in the commodities element only, right, yes, we do hedge and we do cover. But some of that is actually hedges that we put into place now, right, where we've been able to actually lock in some of that favorability that we've seen. I think the big area that we have on hedge, as would most of our competitors, is on PET. And clearly, from that angle, we will benefit, as market dynamics change for that commodity as well, and the other area is sugar. Sugar is very much a part of the EU sugar regime. I think if we look at what we've been able to do, both in '14 and what we see in '15, the supplier is already looking to increase their relationships with some of their key customers and gaining market share with them prior to the change in the regime. So I think we have continued to benefit from that already in '14, and we'll see that in '15 as well. So I wouldn't necessarily read into that too much. Hubert, I don't know if you have any point on additional pricing.\n\n---\n\nYes, our assumption, Ali, moving forward, is that the level of competitive activity will probably remain a bit the same as it was this year. So we don't see a big shift for the year -- for the months to come.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then just last question, if I may. Have you started discussions over the post-2015 concentrate pricing agreement? And what are kind of the puts and takes, how do you work through that with Coke?\n\n---\n\nNik is kind of driving our team in this project. So let me ask Nik to comment on that.\n\n---\n\nYes, I mean, we have clearly started up discussions with them, and I would say to you, those are going well. There is nothing in our discussions today that would indicate that there is any change, as a system that we have, in terms of that incidence based type of agreement. I think there's puts and takes when we look at time lag issues and stuff like that, that we'd like to get resolved. But I think that actually works in favor for the system to be much more aligned on a real-time basis. So I think we're both focused on what do we need to do to grow that business profitably? What do we need to do to grow that system high, so to speak? And again, constructive dialogue, and I think we'll provide you the necessary updates when appropriate, but nothing in our view that's going to change that dramatically.\n\n---\n\nAnd so what timing does it usually come in? What timing should we think about hearing more from you?\n\n---\n\nI think we will continue to work through that during 2015. We'd obviously like to be able to build that into our plan. So I would say more towards the end of next year is when we'd be able to give you an update on that.\n\n---\n\nTwo questions, I guess, the first is I think you said you're looking for 1% volume growth and slightly faster value growth in the category. I think you said that, that's for next year. And I guess sort of what's the run rate, as you're exiting 2014? Can you give us sort of a view in terms of what you think the category growth is right now and how much you need to accelerate that? And then the second question is on the share repurchase program, where you say sort of, at least, $600 million. It sounds like if cash flow comes in better, you could raise that. And I guess, what are the levers that you have from a cash flow standpoint? Is it just basically the operating environment needs to get better and operating income goes up? Or do you feel like there's a decent slice of working capital that you could potentially also tap into to raise the share repurchase number?\n\n---\n\nJust prepare a few comments on category.\n\n---\n\nYes, John, just to clarify, there are some -- the figures we shared were the figures for the category, and what we said is that the year-to-date figures, which are roughly 1% in volume, 1.3% in value, we see this continuing into next year.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And is that what the category is doing right now? Is that a good number for the fourth quarter from a category standpoint, not you guys?\n\n---\n\nThere is some variation in the fourth quarter, but overall, the picture is not so much different.\n\n---\n\nAnd on share repurchase?\n\n---\n\nSure. John, as you -- I think, as you've seen this year as well, we have remained flexible with our ability to execute more on share repurchase, depending on free cash flow, and we had a strong focus on that this year, and I think we will continue to have that next year. Clearly, obviously, the biggest impact's going to be from getting more OI growth. But I would say, obviously, what's been factored in today is also currency, and depending on how that moves or trends, that will have an implication, and the other big element that you've touched upon is working capital. I would say to you, we have started up a concerted program through the company, which is focused on operating working capital, and I think we've seen good traction in that in '14, but definitely more to come in '15, and we'll update you during the course of the year.\n\n---\n\nOkay, operator, we have time for one more question.\n\n---\n\nThis is Brendan for Robert Ottenstein. You guys touched on immediate consumption multiple times on the call today, and it seems like a bit of a new emphasis. Could you maybe dig into that a little bit and tell us, is -- how much of that is incremental to what you have been doing? And what -- how large is it in terms of your overall business? And where do you see the pockets of opportunity across your geographies?\n\n---\n\nLet me just make a general comment that immediate consumption has been an area that we wanted to grow, and has been focusing on for a number of years, so a continued emphasis in 2015. I don't think I've really characterized it as a major new program, rather just a continuing focus that is really important to us because of that. It's a recruitment area and it's also a profitable area. So continuing focus on it. Hubert, if you'd like to comment on some of the things we're specifically doing in '15, that would be useful.\n\n---\n\nI think that's always been a focus for us. What's maybe a bit more new with that, in view of the challenges that our retailers, our customer are facing there, they clearly now see also this as an area for growth and a great opportunity, and our plan is really to enlarge our portfolio. This is what we have been doing with the small can, the 250 ml, with a very affordable pricing. And also, this is why we have been moving with the launch of smartwater, and we are pretty encouraged with the launch of smartwater as a premium IC product. And then in term of acceleration, we're going to place much more coolers and equipments as part of the investment we mentioned in our plan next year.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Well, thanks to all of you for joining us today. We really appreciate your time and interest, and we'd like to wish all of you the very happiest of holiday seasons. Thanks, again, and have a great day.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Stephen Powers (Analysts)】\nI guess, Nik, just following up on your comments on gross margin. Is it fair to assume more favorability on that metric earlier in the year and less, as the year progresses?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Manik Jhangiani (Executives)】\nWell, what I would say to you at this point, we're still working through the exact phasing of our quarters and as we finalize our plans, I think we'll share more with you around that in February.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Stephen Powers (Analysts)】\nOkay. I guess, taking the same metric, different angle, on the flat comps per case outlook, is there any differentiation between sweetener and packaging cost in '15 versus concentrate cost versus -- they're all about flat per case or are there moving parts there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Manik Jhangiani (Executives)】\nNo. They're definitely moving parts. Again, just as a reminder, if you look at COGS, the first big element is concentrate, and that's about 45% of our COGS. So we work on an incidents model there. We have the agreement in place through the end of '15 and how our 2015 concentrate price increase was determined is really based on the rate that we have realized on a unit case basis, not a physical case. So again, I won't go into too many details on that, but we can go into off-line discussions, but there is an impact in terms of a concentrate price increase. And then if you look at commodities, which you'll know, makes up about 30% of our overall COGS, with about roughly half being pure commodity cost and half being conversion cost, the 2 big elements over there are really around PET and sugar. I would say to you we have similar hedge levels, like we've had about this time last year, and we've built that into our current forecast.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Stephen Powers (Analysts)】\nOkay. That's very helpful. And then I guess, just lastly, on the capital structure and leverage ratio, you're basically, as outlook implies, I think, a tick up in leverage for '15, and if my math's right, probably towards the higher end of your 2.5x to 3x range. I guess, just maybe some color on how you think about flexibility for M&A in that context. How to think about how far north of the 3.0 level you might be willing to go, before you look at other levers like reducing the buyback or using equity to finance the deal?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Manik Jhangiani (Executives)】\nYes, sure. Well, first, I would say to you, if you look at where we are right now in our calculations, at the end of 2014, we'll be close to the midpoint of our range. So I wouldn't necessarily see a slight pickup. I think it's more just in the rounding, and we remain committed to being within that range and circle around that midpoint. Now if you look at it from a perspective of flexibility around M&A, I think this continues to offer us the flexibility that we need. We have continued to say that we can temporarily go above that range as needed for strategic investment, and I think our credit rating agencies would see that, too. Plus keep in mind, whatever we would do from an M&A perspective would also bring in EBITDA and cash flows. So we might have to pause share repurchase for a period of time, depending on where that is, before we get back to that range, but I don't think that's going to in any way limit our ability to do M&A if it provides strategic opportunity for us.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Bonnie Herzog (Analysts)】\nJohn, you mentioned you expect to expand your partnership with Monster next year. So I was hoping you could give us a few more details on this. And then could you remind us what percentage Energy is today of your portfolio? And then what percentage you think it can become in the next couple of years?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Brock (Executives)】\nLet me, Bonnie, make a macro comment, and then I'll ask Hubert to talk a little bit more on some of those details. We're just very excited about the Coca-Cola transaction with Monster and the focus that I think that's going to bring from the Monster team on the Energy category in general. Monster itself is just an outstanding brand, and now having the Monster team in charge of all the energy brands, because we have a multi-brand strategy, which has historically worked very well, I think it will bring even more energy enthusiasm and focus to that category, which is among our fastest growing categories, and again, which remains relatively low compared to the kind of energy development we have in the United States. So we're pleased. We're excited, and I'll have Hubert talk a little bit about some of those specifics.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hubert Patricot (Executives)】\nBonnie, as John said, the categories -- energy category continue to be the fastest-growing segment in the NARTD. It's growing 5% in value of this year. We are growing 8%,  so we are gaining share. We think we have the right portfolio and we are now engaged with Monster to see which brand we can expand in other countries, and there is a joint commitment to accelerate on the energy category. So our gross today is 2% to 3% of our volume. It's already more 4% to 5% in revenue, but we're seeing in terms of gross contribution, it can be much bigger in the years to come, and we really think that with Monster and with this new agreement, we have the right platform for continuing growth of energy in the future.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ian Shackleton (Analysts)】\nI think this is the last year or '15 is the last year of the Business Transformation Program, but still there should be something like $35 million of benefit to come. I just wonder what was happening to that? Is that going to be reinvested? Or should some of that come through to the bottom line?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Brock (Executives)】\nI'll ask Nik to give you a kind of a total description of Business Transportation Program and how it's going.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Manik Jhangiani (Executives)】\nSure. Ian, yes, you're spot on. If you recall, we had talked about the restructuring charge of about $240 million all in, and then the benefit's about $110 million, so roughly 1/3 each. So that is spot on. I would say to you, again, as we look at ways to be able to reignite top line growth, particularly from a price and mix perspective, we will continue to reinvest a significant portion of that back into the business into areas such as digital, innovation, et cetera. So that's been factored into the guidance we provided.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ian Shackleton (Analysts)】\nThat's very useful, Nik. Look, are there any plans for an extension of that program over the next few years?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Manik Jhangiani (Executives)】\nI think we continue to look at ways to challenge our business model and to pull costs out of our business. I think it would be too early for me to comment on anything more around that, but we will continue to challenge our business model.\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Brock (Executives)】\nAnd we also focus on that day in and day out. We have a program called Ownership Cost Management, which is not a specific program like the $200 million plus restructuring program, but it's all about making sure all of our employees and associates around treat the company's money as if it there were their own, and that really is -- it's a way of life. It's part of our culture, and so we constantly are looking at how we can better manage our OpEx, and frankly, it's one of the reasons we've been as successful as we have over the last 3 years in traversing what has been a continuing tough environment, yet, through particularly, our focus on OpEx control, day in and day out, and it's to achieve some respectable results. But as Nik said, we're always looking at are there bigger programs to do? We certainly don't have anything right now that we're ready to talk about, though.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ian Shackleton (Analysts)】\nAnd just the final question, really, I think if we think about the GB market, from what we hear at the moment, is not so much the quantity of discounting or promotional activity. Perhaps, the debt has gone -- has increased a bit. Do you think that is setting the tone for 2015? Or is that just a little bit of a one-off, ahead of the Christmas period here?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Brock (Executives)】\nHubert, would you like to comment on GB?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hubert Patricot (Executives)】\nYes. So the environment remains quite competitive in GB. And as you point out, the Christmas time is always a very intense activity within -- in the stores. A good point for us is, as you know, we launched a new packaging strategy in 2014 by combining the 175, the 125 for frequency and the multipack of our 1.5-liter bottles. And then she's offering us distinct point in market for different pricing, and frankly, we can update and we are building on that for the future. And I'm really pleased to report that after a slow start of this strategy, we are seeing a real traction behind this strategy and our penetration with large PET in GB will have increased this year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Judy Hong (Analysts)】\nSo maybe just following up on Ian's question a bit and just more in the context of your pricing outlook. Obviously, I think your gross margin guidance implies you are going to get a bit more pricing and some of that will flow through the gross margin expansion. As you're having conversation with retailers, both in the U.K. and your other markets, can you just talk about how that's going, your confidence in seeing that pricing in the marketplace? And to what extent does your flat operating margin guidance have some flex, where if the competitive environment does get even worse from here on, that you do have the flexibility to sort of meet that challenge?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Manik Jhangiani (Executives)】\nHubert?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hubert Patricot (Executives)】\nYes, Judy, as you know, our tariff negotiation were completed in the Benelux in the third quarter. As you just said, we are now starting our discussion both in France and in GB as usual. I think we are cautiously optimistic, while we approach it, because the context remains challenging for our customer in both countries. However, we think we have a strong program combining what they are looking for, which is also a new product innovation, in tune with shoppers' expectation and strong marketing platform of our program, and John mentioned the Rugby World Cup, which is really important both in GB and France. Obviously, we just have this conversation, and we will share more details when we meet in February. And as you know, talking about flexibility, as the year goes on, promotional programs and business plans may be adjusted to react to marketplace dynamics, as we have done, in fact, this year, utilizing the pricing flexibility we have, thanks to the cost of goods favorability. So we will remain flexible.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Manik Jhangiani (Executives)】\nAnd Judy, I would just add, again, I think, as we've continued to demonstrate, we will continue to look at ways of managing our OpEx base as well as what might potentially, hopefully, be some continued favorability on the COGS line, depending on how oil prices continue to trend. So I would say to you, we will do everything to manage each of the levers of our business to make sure that we can deliver against our commitments.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Judy Hong (Analysts)】\nYes. That's fair. I guess it's just on the context of, obviously, this is the first year where we're likely to, based on your guidance, see your OpEx actually step-up more meaningfully. So wanted to just better understand what the nature of those step-up in terms of what the buckets of increases are, how does that sort of differ, as you think about some of those marketplace investments.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Manik Jhangiani (Executives)】\nYes, and I think, quite honestly, it's really about focus around reigniting top line growth because that's ultimately what we need to be driving. So there's a lot of investments around additional programs around innovation. We continue to see digital grow, and as we need to invest in that fear of the world, we do expect that, over time, that will lead to an opportunity to grow top lines. So those are some of the areas that we continue to be focused in on, Judy.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Judy Hong (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then just my last question, so your expectation about top line growth this year being more volume-oriented, as opposed to pricing oriented, and clearly, the first half of the year, you do have an easier comp in terms of volume. So I know you're not giving us any sort of phasing in terms of the line items. But just thinking about volume expectations, again, sort of lapping that easy comps, would you expect to see better volume pickup more in the earlier part of the year versus later part of the year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Manik Jhangiani (Executives)】\nWell, again, just on phasing, keep in mind, too, that there will be a bit of an anomaly in terms of our number of days. We'll actually have an extra 4 days in Q1, and that will come out in Q4. So net-net, for the full year, that will be zero. So again, I would say to you, hear your point around the comps. We're actually working, as we finalize our plan, with each of the BUs to make sure they're taken to account the phasing of the days, Easter timing, some of the promotional activity timing, and clearly, we'll give you more of that in February.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Nik Modi (Analysts)】\nJust 2 quick ones for me, was wondering if maybe you can provide a little bit of context on Coke Life and some of the early learnings there in terms of are new consumers coming into the category. Is it cannibalizing Diet? So any thoughts there would be helpful. And then the second question is when we think about the guidance for 2015, and certainly, the retail environment is just as bad as the competitive environment across a lot of your territories, with France now going into deflationary territory. So just was wondering if you can give us an update on what's going on at retail and if your guidance really embeds things getting worse at that front.\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Brock (Executives)】\nHubert, you want to talk about Coke Life, as well as the retail environment?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hubert Patricot (Executives)】\nYes. Nik, we introduced, with The Coca-Cola Company, Coke Life in September, as you remember, both in GB and Sweden, and it is now, in fact, available since test months in France. It's a naturally sweet blend cola with a blend of sugar and stevia with 1/3 less calorie, and this product has been received very well and early indicators from both customers and consumers are positive. And you mentioned cannibalization. Yes, we are experiencing expected level of cannibalization to our other trademark Coca-Cola variants, but net, Coca-Cola Life is contributed gains to our overall Cola portfolio, and the trial rate is really encouraging in both countries. And in fact, in addition of funds, we are planning to expand Coca-Cola Life and to roll out the product in all our territories: Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Norway in the coming months, so starting in 2015.\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Brock (Executives)】\nYes, just to add to that, we really, I think, in total, are pleased with the way Coke Life has gone. I think it's been a terrific launch across the board. Hubert and our business units have done an excellent job of end market execution, and -- but because of that, we see expanding it into the balance of our territories, and we think it's going to continue to provide some really exciting levels of consumer choice around a new brand. On the retail environment...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hubert Patricot (Executives)】\nYes, retail environment, overall, I guess the economy is slightly improving. But consumer spending, power remains constrained and the arbitrage overall is not generally favorable to food and beverage sales, and our retailers today are navigating through these challenges, and therefore, to some growth areas, like immediate consumption and specking convenience store, convenience format and online sales, as Nik said. And they are also very keen in carrying new product, new innovation, which the shoppers are looking for. And we are partnering with them, reignite the category gross on these areas, and we are just, as we said, working on a joint business plan for the future. It's tough environment, but we see clearly some area for growth.\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Brock (Executives)】\nAnd just one further comment. I wouldn't -- I don't -- we wouldn't characterize it as getting worse. I think it's a challenging environment, clearly, as Hubert just said, but we understand and we're working with our major retail customers on those areas where there are clear areas of growth and where we can tie in with them, like convenience, like digital. So yes, it's a very challenging retail landscape. There are pockets of consolidation that are also potentially going to be taking place, but I think we would characterize it more as a continuation of the way it's been rather than getting worse. And frankly, with our kind of category, some real opportunities to work with them on some areas of growth for them, which they need so badly.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kevin Grundy (Analysts)】\nSo first on the guidance, I was hoping you could maybe clarify what you're assuming for industry growth from a volume and value share perspective. So in other words, you guys are guiding to up slightly from a value perspective. What do you anticipate from an industry growth perspective?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hubert Patricot (Executives)】\nAs John said, we are preaching a continuation of what we have seen this year for the industry. So you are talking 1% volume, 1.2, 1.3 in value, but again, with variation to our country, but this is overall the picture, so around the 1%.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kevin Grundy (Analysts)】\nOkay. All right, that's helpful. And then with respect to the spending behind price. How good do you feel like your visibility is, and in particular, sort of vis-a-vis relative to what the competition may do. So that's part one of the question. And secondarily, how much cushion do you have left in your guidance? Because I guess the prior commentary was that the business transformation spending, which would be 3% to 3.5% contribution to OI, that seems like it's already committed to price investment. So how much flexibility do you sort of have left should the promotional environment get worse?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Brock (Executives)】\nLet me make a comment on the business transformation piece, and then ask Hubert to talk about the price increase. I think we've been pretty consistent since we've started the Business Transformation Program 3 years ago, saying that the principal objectives of it were going to be able to reinvest in the business, and to the degree we had extra funds, we'd use it to de-risk our budget. But the principal plan was to be able to invest significantly in digital and innovation, and honestly, in protecting our license to operate. You'll recall, the debacle we had in France with the excise tax, we, in The Coca-Cola Company and the industry, have really put ourselves in a totally different position today to be ready to deal with those kinds of things. Hubert, of course, is President of UNESDA, which is a major Trade Association in Europe, which has been completely revitalized, and put us in a far stronger position to deal with various kinds of legislative, regulatory or tax threats. And some of the money that we needed to be able to invest in that came from our business transformation programs. So we never really considered that it was going to be a major profit generator. It was really all about digital, innovation and our license to operate, and I think that's clearly -- we're seeing the third year of that in 2015. And as you said, it does gives us a little bit of a cushion in terms of de-risking the budget, but that was not of principal focus of it. Pricing?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hubert Patricot (Executives)】\nYes, pricing, it starts as a global joint business plans. We are working with our customers as we engage with them, and we always see and still see the category as growing in value and expendables for both them and us. And we continue, as we said, to see the overall environment to be a bit challenging and competitive. However, what matters to us is to start with the shoppers in each country, and to come with the right tag price architecture, and this is really what we have been doing in the past months and years, and for example, this moment, we are engaging in France and GB. In France, it's really critical to reignite the growth of the value of the category, and this is what we have been doing in this past year and we plan to continue. So yes, taking some pride, building some value in the category in unison with our customers. So again, it's a shopper tag price architecture in each market.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Manik Jhangiani (Executives)】\nAnd technically, I would just characterize our guidance is it's really what we would, for a lack of better word, just say middle-of-the-road. We missed guidance last year, and as John said earlier, we're looking at ways to improve that for this year, too. So we are focused on that. And we're not pleased with where it is, and we'll do everything to try and focus on improving that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kevin Grundy (Analysts)】\nNo. I think that makes sense, Nik, and just one more if I may. John, would you care to further your comments at all? You've mentioned pockets of consolidation taking place this year. Would you care to further that at all, even just broadly?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Brock (Executives)】\nI was -- when I talked about consolidation, I was talking about retailers. They're continuing to discuss, and could you comment on...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hubert Patricot (Executives)】\nYes, we think consolidation, for example, in Norway, we are the #3 retailer or the #4. You see some purchasing alliance in France. So you see still a trend, which is not totally new news, but a trend for retailer consolidation is going on.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ali Dibadj (Analysts)】\nSo a couple of things. One is I guess I'm still having trouble with the no leverage between top line growth and operating profit growth on a kind of comparable country neutral basis, especially within the flexibility you're talking about on the business transformation, on, I think, the commodities, to amount of pricing a little bit. And I guess, if it is all being reinvested, maybe so the core of the question, if it is at all being reinvested, we're not really seeing a pickup in your guidance from a top line perspective. So I guess, I'm trying to square the gap there in terms of, if it all is going back into the business, why are we not seeing anything better from a top line perspective than what you're guiding to?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Manik Jhangiani (Executives)】\nSure, I mean, Ali, I think the point here is that we are making investments and this is really for the mid- to long-term. This isn't about make the investment and get the return in the same year. We'd love to see that, again, as I said, and I think John has continued to reiterate, we will continue to look at flexed items to be able to improve some of that leverage as well, and we're hoping some of those will come in our favor. But this is really investments that we're making in areas such as innovation, convenience, which is a growing channel, and we're looking at small basket-sized types of offerings, et cetera. These are things that will come through in the ensuing years. And I would say to you, we are continuing to look at ways to challenge our plans, and we'll continue to update you guys as that changes improve, hopefully, during the course of the year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ali Dibadj (Analysts)】\nOkay. From a competitive perspective, can you give us a little bit more on what you're expecting there, and perhaps, how that influences the guidance? But really, what you're expecting from competitors? And the angle I want to ask on is are they, competitors, more levered to the pure commodity cost declines, given your kind of very large and relatively immutable concentrated pricing within your COGS? So would the commodity declines benefit them more than you, and perhaps, put them at a little bit of an advantage in the short term? Or is that not the right way to think about it?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Manik Jhangiani (Executives)】\nYes, I mean, I'm not necessarily sure that's the right way to think about it. Again, if you look at it from an overall COGS perspective in the commodities element only, right, yes, we do hedge and we do cover. But some of that is actually hedges that we put into place now, right, where we've been able to actually lock in some of that favorability that we've seen. I think the big area that we have on hedge, as would most of our competitors, is on PET. And clearly, from that angle, we will benefit, as market dynamics change for that commodity as well, and the other area is sugar. Sugar is very much a part of the EU sugar regime. I think if we look at what we've been able to do, both in '14 and what we see in '15, the supplier is already looking to increase their relationships with some of their key customers and gaining market share with them prior to the change in the regime. So I think we have continued to benefit from that already in '14, and we'll see that in '15 as well. So I wouldn't necessarily read into that too much. Hubert, I don't know if you have any point on additional pricing.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hubert Patricot (Executives)】\nYes, our assumption, Ali, moving forward, is that the level of competitive activity will probably remain a bit the same as it was this year. So we don't see a big shift for the year -- for the months to come.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ali Dibadj (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then just last question, if I may. Have you started discussions over the post-2015 concentrate pricing agreement? And what are kind of the puts and takes, how do you work through that with Coke?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Brock (Executives)】\nNik is kind of driving our team in this project. So let me ask Nik to comment on that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Manik Jhangiani (Executives)】\nYes, I mean, we have clearly started up discussions with them, and I would say to you, those are going well. There is nothing in our discussions today that would indicate that there is any change, as a system that we have, in terms of that incidence based type of agreement. I think there's puts and takes when we look at time lag issues and stuff like that, that we'd like to get resolved. But I think that actually works in favor for the system to be much more aligned on a real-time basis. So I think we're both focused on what do we need to do to grow that business profitably? What do we need to do to grow that system high, so to speak? And again, constructive dialogue, and I think we'll provide you the necessary updates when appropriate, but nothing in our view that's going to change that dramatically.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ali Dibadj (Analysts)】\nAnd so what timing does it usually come in? What timing should we think about hearing more from you?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Manik Jhangiani (Executives)】\nI think we will continue to work through that during 2015. We'd obviously like to be able to build that into our plan. So I would say more towards the end of next year is when we'd be able to give you an update on that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Faucher (Analysts)】\nTwo questions, I guess, the first is I think you said you're looking for 1% volume growth and slightly faster value growth in the category. I think you said that, that's for next year. And I guess sort of what's the run rate, as you're exiting 2014? Can you give us sort of a view in terms of what you think the category growth is right now and how much you need to accelerate that? And then the second question is on the share repurchase program, where you say sort of, at least, $600 million. It sounds like if cash flow comes in better, you could raise that. And I guess, what are the levers that you have from a cash flow standpoint? Is it just basically the operating environment needs to get better and operating income goes up? Or do you feel like there's a decent slice of working capital that you could potentially also tap into to raise the share repurchase number?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Brock (Executives)】\nJust prepare a few comments on category.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hubert Patricot (Executives)】\nYes, John, just to clarify, there are some -- the figures we shared were the figures for the category, and what we said is that the year-to-date figures, which are roughly 1% in volume, 1.3% in value, we see this continuing into next year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Faucher (Analysts)】\nOkay. And is that what the category is doing right now? Is that a good number for the fourth quarter from a category standpoint, not you guys?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hubert Patricot (Executives)】\nThere is some variation in the fourth quarter, but overall, the picture is not so much different.\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Brock (Executives)】\nAnd on share repurchase?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Manik Jhangiani (Executives)】\nSure. John, as you -- I think, as you've seen this year as well, we have remained flexible with our ability to execute more on share repurchase, depending on free cash flow, and we had a strong focus on that this year, and I think we will continue to have that next year. Clearly, obviously, the biggest impact's going to be from getting more OI growth. But I would say, obviously, what's been factored in today is also currency, and depending on how that moves or trends, that will have an implication, and the other big element that you've touched upon is working capital. I would say to you, we have started up a concerted program through the company, which is focused on operating working capital, and I think we've seen good traction in that in '14, but definitely more to come in '15, and we'll update you during the course of the year.\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Brock (Executives)】\nOkay, operator, we have time for one more question.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Brendan Metrano (Analysts)】\nThis is Brendan for Robert Ottenstein. You guys touched on immediate consumption multiple times on the call today, and it seems like a bit of a new emphasis. Could you maybe dig into that a little bit and tell us, is -- how much of that is incremental to what you have been doing? And what -- how large is it in terms of your overall business? And where do you see the pockets of opportunity across your geographies?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Brock (Executives)】\nLet me just make a general comment that immediate consumption has been an area that we wanted to grow, and has been focusing on for a number of years, so a continued emphasis in 2015. I don't think I've really characterized it as a major new program, rather just a continuing focus that is really important to us because of that. It's a recruitment area and it's also a profitable area. So continuing focus on it. Hubert, if you'd like to comment on some of the things we're specifically doing in '15, that would be useful.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hubert Patricot (Executives)】\nI think that's always been a focus for us. What's maybe a bit more new with that, in view of the challenges that our retailers, our customer are facing there, they clearly now see also this as an area for growth and a great opportunity, and our plan is really to enlarge our portfolio. This is what we have been doing with the small can, the 250 ml, with a very affordable pricing. And also, this is why we have been moving with the launch of smartwater, and we are pretty encouraged with the launch of smartwater as a premium IC product. And then in term of acceleration, we're going to place much more coolers and equipments as part of the investment we mentioned in our plan next year.\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Brock (Executives)】\nOkay. Well, thanks to all of you for joining us today. We really appreciate your time and interest, and we'd like to wish all of you the very happiest of holiday seasons. Thanks, again, and have a great day.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you, operator. A very eloquent operator today, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we reported financial and operating results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2015. We are very pleased with the strong same-store sales and strong financial and operating results. I will let Michael provide you with the details relating to the financial results and our operating initiatives for the quarter. \r\nFrom my perspective, this quarter was defined by strong same-store sales of 5.9% as we increased the number of transactions by 1.1% in the stores and benefited from the growing demand for our higher-priced point items, as evidenced by the 4.8% increase in the average basket size. \r\nOverall, we're very satisfied with our current price mix, as it continues to stimulate sales and drive traffic to our stores. Our sales this quarter were fueled also by very strong Halloween season sales, as our customers responded positively to our compelling range of Halloween products. The Halloween season was also benefited by -- from ideal sales conditions, including the fact that weather was very favorable compared to the prior year and the fact that Halloween fell on a Friday.\r\nOur sales also continued to rise as we grow our business organically through the opening of 11 net new stores across Canada. Although the pace was slightly lower than in recent quarters due to the timing of new store deliveries, you can rest assured that we can still anticipate the opening of 75 to 80 net new stores in fiscal 2015. These stores continue to be opened in quality retail locations across Canada, with the majority of new stores located in Ontario, British Columbia and Alberta, which are markets that continue to be underpenetrated with dollar stores. We continue to focus our efforts on densifying core urban centers in these markets as well as other markets across Canada.\r\nFollowing the success of the Halloween season, we are now focused on offering a great assortment of -- to our customers for the upcoming Christmas season. Having experienced very challenging weather conditions in December 2013, especially in the 2 weeks leading up to Christmas, we are now hoping that Mother Nature will be more cooperative this year. Let me now turn the call over to Michael. Michael?\n\n---\n\nThank you, Larry, and good morning, everyone. So during the third quarter, we increased our sales by 12.4% to $588 million from $522.9 million in the prior year. The increase in sales was fueled by the opening of 81 net new stores over the past 12 months and a same-store sales increase of 5.9% over and above a 4.8% increase reported for Q3 in the prior year. Same-store sales increase in Q3 consisted of 4.8% increase in basket size, which reflects the consumer demand for our higher price point items and a 1.1% increase in the number of transactions, which was boosted by strong Halloween sales.\r\nIn the third quarter, our gross margin was 36.8% of sales, compared to 37.1% of sales in Q3 last year. This decrease is partly attributable to slightly lower product margins as we absorb some of the cost increases in order to maintain the compelling value of our products. As we stated earlier this year, we have been managing our gross margin by continually reinvesting in the value proposition offered to our customers. We expect this trend to continue as we target a range between 36% and 37% in fiscal 2015 in order to stimulate continued sales growth.\r\nOur Q3 SG&A as a percentage of sales was 17.2% compared to 18.1% last year. This progression is the result of improved labor productivity achieved through initiatives implemented at store level, including refined labor scheduling and reduction of the number of manual inventory counts. We expect the SG&A to be between 17.1% and 17.5% for the full 2015 fiscal year. \r\nOur depreciation and amortization expense decreased by $2.5 million this year as a result of change in estimated useful life of our leasehold improvements in our store and warehouse equipment that was made effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. \r\nAs announced last quarter, the company completed a 2-for-1 share split by way of share dividend paid on November 17, 2014. The share split ensures that our common shares remain accessible to individual shareholders, potentially increasing and broadening our shareholder base and improving market liquidity for our common shares. Note that all share information and earnings per share data reported for the third quarter ended November 2, 2014 have been retrospectively restated to reflect the 2-for-1 share split. \r\nOur Q3 net earnings increased to $73 million or $0.55 per diluted share, taking into consideration the share split, compared to $61.7 million or $0.43 per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal 2014. \r\nDuring the quarter, we also repurchased for cancellation 1,233,590 shares on a post-split basis under our normal course issuer bid for consideration of $58.4 million at a weighted average price of $47.32 per common share. \r\nIn terms of our productivity initiatives, we continue to leverage off the benefits of several initiatives rolled out in the stores over the past year, including the Kronos scheduling solution and new point of sales terminal in all of our stores. The Kronos advanced scheduling solution has contributed to the improved labor productivity at store level by more efficiently allocating hours based on the volume and seasonality of sales in each store. This ensures that we have enough employees in stores to handle peak sales period, while reducing hours in lower sales period. \r\nWe are also increasing our reliance on scan data for replenishment purposes, thereby reducing the number of labor hours related to manually -- manual daily counts at store level. \r\nAdditional projects are being evaluated that could further leverage the investments previously made in the stores. This includes the use of new functionalities available on the point-of-sale terminals to streamline the cash management processes and use of the scanning technology to further reduce manual tasks in the store. \r\nOverall, we are very pleased with the performance of the company this quarter and the progress made on our key initiatives.\r\nThis ends our formal remarks, and we can now take questions. So operator, I'll turn the call over to you.",

We continue to focus our efforts on densifying core urban centers in these markets as well as other markets across Canada.\r\nFollowing the success of the Halloween season, we are now focused on offering a great assortment of -- to our customers for the upcoming Christmas season. Having experienced very challenging weather conditions in December 2013, especially in the 2 weeks leading up to Christmas, we are now hoping that Mother Nature will be more cooperative this year. Let me now turn the call over to Michael. Michael?\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nThank you, Larry, and good morning, everyone. So during the third quarter, we increased our sales by 12.4% to $588 million from $522.9 million in the prior year. The increase in sales was fueled by the opening of 81 net new stores over the past 12 months and a same-store sales increase of 5.9% over and above a 4.8% increase reported for Q3 in the prior year. Same-store sales increase in Q3 consisted of 4.8% increase in basket size, which reflects the consumer demand for our higher price point items and a 1.1% increase in the number of transactions, which was boosted by strong Halloween sales.\r\nIn the third quarter, our gross margin was 36.8% of sales, compared to 37.1% of sales in Q3 last year. This decrease is partly attributable to slightly lower product margins as we absorb some of the cost increases in order to maintain the compelling value of our products. As we stated earlier this year, we have been managing our gross margin by continually reinvesting in the value proposition offered to our customers. We expect this trend to continue as we target a range between 36% and 37% in fiscal 2015 in order to stimulate continued sales growth.\r\nOur Q3 SG&A as a percentage of sales was 17.2% compared to 18.1% last year. This progression is the result of improved labor productivity achieved through initiatives implemented at store level, including refined labor scheduling and reduction of the number of manual inventory counts. We expect the SG&A to be between 17.1% and 17.5% for the full 2015 fiscal year. \r\nOur depreciation and amortization expense decreased by $2.5 million this year as a result of change in estimated useful life of our leasehold improvements in our store and warehouse equipment that was made effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. \r\nAs announced last quarter, the company completed a 2-for-1 share split by way of share dividend paid on November 17, 2014. The share split ensures that our common shares remain accessible to individual shareholders, potentially increasing and broadening our shareholder base and improving market liquidity for our common shares. Note that all share information and earnings per share data reported for the third quarter ended November 2, 2014 have been retrospectively restated to reflect the 2-for-1 share split. \r\nOur Q3 net earnings increased to $73 million or $0.55 per diluted share, taking into consideration the share split, compared to $61.7 million or $0.43 per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal 2014. \r\nDuring the quarter, we also repurchased for cancellation 1,233,590 shares on a post-split basis under our normal course issuer bid for consideration of $58.4 million at a weighted average price of $47.32 per common share. \r\nIn terms of our productivity initiatives, we continue to leverage off the benefits of several initiatives rolled out in the stores over the past year, including the Kronos scheduling solution and new point of sales terminal in all of our stores. The Kronos advanced scheduling solution has contributed to the improved labor productivity at store level by more efficiently allocating hours based on the volume and seasonality of sales in each store. This ensures that we have enough employees in stores to handle peak sales period, while reducing hours in lower sales period. \r\nWe are also increasing our reliance on scan data for replenishment purposes, thereby reducing the number of labor hours related to manually -- manual daily counts at store level. \r\nAdditional projects are being evaluated that could further leverage the investments previously made in the stores. This includes the use of new functionalities available on the point-of-sale terminals to streamline the cash management processes and use of the scanning technology to further reduce manual tasks in the store. \r\nOverall, we are very pleased with the performance of the company this quarter and the progress made on our key initiatives.\r\nThis ends our formal remarks, and we can now take questions. So operator, I'll turn the call over to you.",
      "transcript_text3": "The increase in percentage of items over $1 was obviously the driver of the basket size increase. Just wondering if there were other drivers. Have you seen, for instance, more items in the basket? And -- or has the mix of categories changed in the basket?\n\n---\n\nNot from my perspective. Michael?\n\n---\n\nNo. It's -- there's no change, whether in that category or it's higher price point items penetration increase.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And on the gross margin side, given the level of the Canadian dollar and where rents have been trending, do you have a feel for the range of gross margins for next fiscal year? Is there any reason to believe that it should be different from the 36% to 37% range that you've -- that you're currently running at?\n\n---\n\nYes. For the moment, we're -- we still believe it's within 36% to 37%.\n\n---\n\nYes. I think that in spite of the Canadian dollar, we can manage and give the value we want to give between 36% and 37%.\n\n---\n\nWill rents pressure that at all?\n\n---\n\nNope.\n\n---\n\nAnd just my last question, if I could. You've survived several minimum wage increases by improving labor productivity. Is there more labor productivity improvement available to the business?\n\n---\n\nYes, there is, certainly. And you're right. I mean, we -- just in Q3, we have 5 provinces that implemented wage -- minimum wage increases, averaging about 2.5%. But, yes, we do strive to improve efficiency and reduce cost over time, and I believe that there's still room to improve. How much, we won't go there. We've got, obviously, our own estimates. But for the purpose of this call, we're certainly working to continue improving the G&A ratio.\n\n---\n\nSticking to the drivers of the basket growth, was there a higher number of items at the higher price points? Or really is it sort of the normal maturation process that's just getting better at understanding which products are going to sell through at that price?\n\n---\n\nIt's just normal -- there's nothing special that happened. We don't comment, obviously, on the details as to the unit content in basket. But I would say it's just normal progression. It's higher price point items penetration, but nothing special occurring at this point.\n\n---\n\nYes. I think I'd agree with that. We're not doing anything special, so our customers seem to be doing that for us.\n\n---\n\nYes, they are. And just, again, thinking ahead to the Q4 season, if memory serves me correctly, in the past, there is a reasonable proportion of seasonal items that are still at the lower range of those price points in Q4. Are you changing the mix of the Q4 price points for this year?\n\n---\n\nTricky. You'll see some of the lower price points. We're not doing it on purpose. I think, Neil, do you have anything to say on this subject?\n\n---\n\nNo.\n\n---\n\nNo? We react according to the products that are put in front of us, the value we can give and evaluate the assortment that should be offered. There's nothing extraordinary about what's happening. And certain lower price point -- let's say, dollar items, may have to go to $1.25. But we measure that very carefully and study that very carefully because we're still a dollar store and our -- from our perspective, and like to stay at -- to have certainly an assortment of items at that price point. So nothing special.\n\n---\n\nAnd just one final question, if I might. Clearly, the decline in oil prices is highly topical this at time. I'm just wondering whether if oil -- if prices stay in and around current levels whether that would have a meaningful and material impact on your transportation costs, recognizing that you do an awful lot by rail.\n\n---\n\nRight. So we'll see. If there -- if we can benefit from lower costs, so be it. But again, that will help us in the savings. And hopefully, we -- if there are savings, we can transfer that into the value proposition.\n\n---\n\nYes. I don't expect that to happen. As you know, when prices of oil goes up, transportation costs go up because they use that as the reason for increased prices. When they go down, you hear nothing from them. So -- and that's life. It's the same as negotiating prices in the Orient. We're hearing about even price increases on incoming inbound freight from the Orient. So -- and we're fighting that with the normal logic that should be used. Prices are down, oil is down, et cetera, et cetera. But they still come back and say, well, volume is up and this and that. So there's always that discussion, if you put it that way. So I don't expect huge savings coming from the reduction in oil prices. That's all.\n\n---\n\nAnd we're all going to stay focused on the same issues, I'm sure. But can you give us any idea as to what role the exchange rate played in the average basket inflation and what impact it might have had on gross margin?\n\n---\n\nNo. It's hard to measure it directly, Jim. But obviously, as we said, the more we manage the margin, the better chances we have at protecting that top line or stimulating the top line growth. So we did absorb part of that additional cost, but to say specifically what the impact is...\n\n---\n\nLook, the Canadian dollar will create inflation here in Canada, the reduction in its value, no question. So it's invariably creating some inflation in our prices, and that's to be expected. To what extent, how much, that's hard to measure. And we don't measure it, we just -- trying to work on certain margins, certain value. And -- but if your question is, is it creating some inflation, inflation in our concept as opposed to others? Yes, it is. Not as opposed to others, but it is within ours. And I would think that it's causing inflation throughout the retail market industry.\n\n---\n\nRight. We'd be all on the same level playing field.\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nYes. So would you have seen your average basket in Q3 being up versus Q2 or sequentially...\n\n---\n\nIt is...\n\n---\n\nIt is up compared to Q2.\n\n---\n\nAnd how much?\n\n---\n\nI don't know if that's normal. If you went back in history, if those 2 Qs are -- I don't know that.\n\n---\n\nYes. We don't have the -- to the -- your question, Jim, is what part of the currency management had an impact on the basket size in Q3 compared to Q2, for example.\n\n---\n\nMuch better worded than my question, yes.\n\n---\n\nNo. Well, the answer is the same though. So...\n\n---\n\nNo, I appreciate that.\n\n---\n\nOkay.\n\n---\n\nOkay. No, I appreciate the color.\n\n---\n\nYes, it's hard. Yes.\n\n---\n\nLooking out on your buyback activity, I think you made a comment last quarter that in terms of leverage, ideally, you'd like to maintain your current debt rating, and so adding more debt leverage is not necessarily a conscious intent at this time. How do you see the use of your free cash flow? I mean, you obviously are generating a decent amount. When you look into next year, do you see allocating more free cash flow to buyback or sort of maintaining current course of buyback intensity?\n\n---\n\nRight. Well, yes. So we continue to favor buybacks. So we do -- especially in Q4, that's a period where you do generate most of the cash flow -- free cash flow. And -- but as the EBITDA continues growing, that opens up more leverage opportunity, if you want. And the idea is to remain within BBB stable range. And -- but over time, we will be able to continue leveraging up, given the increase in EBITDA also.\n\n---\n\nAnd I know it's early, but FX 2016 -- 2015, 2016, do you still expect 70 to 80 stores a year and the majority of your CapEx being skewed to that? And the infamous question always gets asked about, what about -- do you see in Western Canada?\n\n---\n\nOkay.\n\n---\n\nNot yet. I can't see that for the next few years.\n\n---\n\nAnd just to be clear, for this year, Larry, we're talking about 70 to 80 stores. And next year, for F '16, also 70 to 80 stores.\n\n---\n\nThis year, yes, '15, 75 to 80 stores. Next year, well, it's hard to put an exact number, but certainly, 70 to 80 stores. Hopefully, closer to the 80, but 70 to 80.\n\n---\n\nNo extraordinary other items that would affect CapEx spend then?\n\n---\n\nNo. If we -- no. The average CapEx intensity ratio, excluding the growth CapEx, is pretty stable and should be expected for the years to come, unless we would announce something special, which we don't see right now. And no, so nothing special next year.\n\n---\n\nCan you guys comment on some of your SG&A initiatives, the Kronos labor management system, implementation of the POS and how the -- your sort of data analytics surrounding that are really driving or are they really driving this impressive SG&A leverage that we've seen in the last few quarters?\n\n---\n\nYes. We can comment, but, I mean, it's the same answers, really. It's with the same system. It's just that we're -- as we've stated in the past and as I've mentioned to you in the past, is that we continue to leverage our POS, turning on functionalities, just getting better and better at scheduling, working in stores. We -- there's a speed at which you roll out initiatives. There's so much that our employees can absorb at a time, and we do it cautiously and we take our time to do it correctly. And hopefully, we can sustain -- just from of the labor scheduling tool, hopefully continue to generate savings in the future. We've got other initiatives going on. Johanne is very involved in the stores and looking at and bringing ideas for new initiatives. So hopefully, we'll see that coming in into the future. But for the time being, it's the same -- more or less, the same tools that generate the savings that you've seen and that, hopefully, we can continue seeing it in the future.\n\n---\n\nMichael, have you done any more work on what the impact is going to be on your procurement when Canada changes its trade status with China? I think that's effective January 1, so duty is going to go up on a lot of the items you bring in. I mean, you've said that -- I think in the past when we've talked about this on the call, you said you haven't been able to quantify it yet. So I'm just wondering if you've done any work and what you can talk about.\n\n---\n\nYes. We -- when we have -- we were able to quantify it, we didn't want to disclose it. We know and we told you it wasn't material. What you can anticipate in Q4 will be a slight nonmaterial increase in inventory because we will be or have been prebuying just before the rates kick in. But after that, for the rest, it's business as usual. Nothing special going on. No words to have with that. I mean, the currency has been -- had a much, much larger impact than the duties with have.\n\n---\n\nYes, it's just simply another headwind like foreign exchange, and we manage them in the same way. So there's not -- we don't manage those duty increases in any different way. The buyers are well aware of them, well aware of what they have factor in for next year and that's what they do.\n\n---\n\nDo you think the imposition of the duties will cause your category mix to change at all?\n\n---\n\n0.\n\n---\n\nI was wondering, in terms of your suppliers in China, whether you're noticing any difference or whether they're being impacted by excess capacity or lack of capacity or just what the situation is there.\n\n---\n\nWell, I could give you the long answer to a very short one, 0. We've noticed 0. No impact, no change, no difference. Absolutely none. Neil?\n\n---\n\nNone.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And then just in terms of the freight situation. Some people have been mentioning tight situation in the West Coast. Have you pretty much already brought in all your inventory and so there's no issue?\n\n---\n\nI'm not aware of any issue. That was brought up to my attention this week by someone, are you -- are we having problems getting merchandise through Vancouver because of the problems they're having apparently in the States. So the answer is none. We're having 0 impact.\n\n---\n\nAnd then just on the Christmas season, is the gift card program a significant part of your business or is it sort of steady-state?\n\n---\n\nNo, it's steady. It's not -- nothing major.\n\n---\n\nYes, I'd agree.\n\n---\n\nAnd then just on the...\n\n---\n\nOkay. Last question, Keith, please.\n\n---\n\nYes. Just on the competitive landscape, are you noticing anything different on the party side of the business? Do you see some activity there by Party City and others? Are you feeling any change there on your sales pattern?\n\n---\n\nI'll answer that one. We haven't. And I've spoken to my -- to our party people and they haven't. So I guess the answer is no. Should we be? That's a question, Keith?\n\n---\n\nOh, well, I don't think so.\n\n---\n\nOkay, no. No, the answer is no.\n\n---\n\nJust a quick question for you, Michael, and I appreciate Larry clarifying for us that we would still have store openings this year of 75 to 80. Is there something that happened in the third quarter that saw you with a slight flowing of the openings or there was nothing unusual?\n\n---\n\nYou can speak to all the landlords that we deal with and that's the answer. It's as simple as that.\n\n---\n\nOkay. That's good clarification.\n\n---\n\nIt's just timing.\n\n---\n\nOkay.\n\n---\n\nYes, it's just timing.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Excellent. Great.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Patricia.\n\n---\n\nAnd Larry, you can ask me questions and make my job easier, if you want. New store contribution, I don't know if it was covered in the first few questions in the call, but I was just wondering if you can characterize what we're seeing in terms of new store contributions if it's fairly steady and is that on a per-store basis, per square foot basis? Because I do know that some of your new stores are maybe a bit smaller.\n\n---\n\nYes. They were last year. This year it happens not to be. And it's just -- it's not by design, it's just by opportunity. And I think we're back to a, more or less, normal size this year. We're close to 10,000-foot average. Last year may have been a little less because we got a bunch of stores in the metropolitan areas of Toronto and we took them. I think that answers your question. I'm not sure if there was something -- and as far as new stores, the pace was a little slower this year. We'll have a lot of stores in the fourth quarter because that's -- I just answered that question to the previous caller. But I think that the return on investment or the...\n\n---\n\nIt is more or less the same.\n\n---\n\nMore or less the same as it has been for the...\n\n---\n\nGreat. A pretty steady state. And so beautifully boring goes the story. And then just beyond this existing growth story, could you talk a little bit about -- maybe what the company thinks in terms of stepping out and looking for other growth opportunities? Obviously, Central America is something you're looking at and working on, maybe you can update us on that. And then have you thought about other retail formats or importing, exporting opportunities where you can use some of your core strengths and leverage them?\n\n---\n\nIs this where you want me to ask you the question? Michael, you want to make a comment on that?\n\n---\n\nYes, yes. Okay. So in terms of -- so again, there are 2 -- the answer is boringly the same. So it's steady as she goes. Central America, again, still not material. We continue to work our way there. Things are looking very good, in line with our expectations. So hopefully, we can sustain that over time. And for the rest, we do a lot of homework on a lot of stuff, but nothing to discuss at this time.\n\n---\n\nCentral America, basically we've concentrated in El Salvador. I think we're about to go into Guatemala. So if you want to come with me on the next trip, that would be fine, David. Yes, I know. I know. I know. You'd rather not, I understand.\n\n---\n\nI'll check the budget. And so you were at 15 stores, if I recall before, does this mean this -- if that's correct, is this number 16?\n\n---\n\nNo, no, no.\n\n---\n\nWe don't comment on that. But you can assume it's going to go up, obviously, but we're not going to comment on details.\n\n---\n\nNo details.\n\n---\n\nBoring.\n\n---\n\nI told you it would be boring. So...\n\n---\n\nI think I read somewhere that your company recently joined the United Grocers buying group. I'm just wondering if -- what type of benefits or if you can help us understand the rationale behind that and maybe quantify any substantial savings you expect from that group?\n\n---\n\nSure. Chris, it's Neil. We joined UGI basically for one reason alone, which was to take advantage of the greater buying power of the buying group. None of our costs are shared. We have no intentions of changing our product mix or our price point. And as you know, unlike the balance of our assortment, our food offering, they're sold only up to $2 as opposed to $3. So we just joined for that and only that reason. If there are other benefits over time, then they'll be icing on the cake.\n\n---\n\nOkay, that's helpful. And my second question is, I know that in the past you've said that as your company gets bigger, you have more clouts with the national suppliers. Are you able to share with us what is your national brand penetration currently versus, say, 12 months ago? And I guess my question is really trying to understand, there's no question you're getting more national products into your stores, is that having a material benefit with respect to attracting more traffic into your stores?\n\n---\n\nNo, we haven't seen that. We basically have kept the same buying philosophy, which is we have a sprinkling of national brands across as many categories as we can to add that option for our customer that has the luxury to pay the slightly higher costs that are associated with the national brand, even if they are at competitive prices within our stores. And we continue to buy them when the opportunities make sense. But there is no change in strategy.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And my last question is, can you comment on how your mature stores, say, older than 5 or 7 years, how are those stores performing from a same-store sales growth perspective versus your overall average? Are they comping positive? And so are they closer, similar to your average for the company?\n\n---\n\nYes. It's more or less similar.\n\n---\n\nIf I could, Michael, I would like -- given the -- your success of navigating some of the wage inflation headwinds, the amount of runway you've highlighted by way of initiatives or other, can you help me understand or walk us through what's stopping you or should stop us from thinking of your sort of G&A margins in more of a -- perhaps, a 16% to 17% than a 17% to 18% sort of range? I just look at the amount of runway you appear to have and how the ease with which, and I use the term cautiously, you've appeared to navigate the headwinds to date and I'm trying to reconcile sort of what would stop us thinking of the business as something of a further improvement even on your G&A leverage from where we are today or where you're sort of guiding to or thinking about today.\n\n---\n\nYes. The key word there is cautious and you used it. So go ahead, Michael.\n\n---\n\nRight. No, I think that, obviously, there's a minimum of hours that you need to work in-store, so there are some limits. But hopefully, we haven't reached that. We believe that there's still room to continue improving, and again, depending on headwinds. But there's also another element, is that as we implement new initiatives to sustain the efficiency in the future, these are costs that we have to record over time. These are new initiatives and the timing of the recording of those might impact some quarters more than others. So there's -- it's not just that we have finished spending money on initiatives and now we're just reaping the benefits of those in the future. We need to make further -- make future further investments to continue improving over time. There's at store level that's also on the logistics side that we're thinking about and doing homework on.\n\n---\n\nYes, let me add to that. You have to appreciate that the dollar store business is a labor-intensive business. We are placing items on our stores between $1 and $3 on our stores -- on our counters in our stores, and that's a lot of labor that is required. So there are only so many initiatives that we can do before -- unless you're working on some robotic replenishment system. We still have to open boxes, put the merchandise on the counters and then pass those -- pass that through the cash, and that's all labor that cannot be eliminated. Again, I don't know where technology is going, but it's unlikely. So to get these labor -- this SG&A down, it's going to get harder and harder and we have to be more and more careful and cautious. We have to check out our customers more rapidly, give them more satisfaction. Make it easier to shop at a Dollarama than it is at the competition, for example. And that will take more technology that we're working on. But that may not decrease the amount of labor, it just may increase our efficiency. So it will come out to 0 at the end. That's all I can say on the labor question, Kenric.\n\n---\n\nMuch appreciated. Makes a lot of sense. Just a quick follow-up with respect the competitive landscape, and you touched on it, your relative experience. Is it safe to assume that at this point the competitive landscape is such that there wouldn't be any need in the foreseeable future for increased spend by way of some of the more traditional options, marketing spend on flyers or otherwise? I mean, that proposition, to my mind, is still -- is that compelling relative to anything I see in the market that I don't believe that would be the case. Or is that a reasonable basis to be looking at sort of at least in the next couple of years?\n\n---\n\nNot looking at it. We don't think so. In 2 years, what can happen 2 years after that, we're up to 4 years now, I don't know. But I don't particularly like the idea. It brings a whole bureaucracy to the system and dissatisfaction that created for our customers because you can't advertise and not have, and that seems to be the history of advertising. So I think we're going to keep it, as long as possible, nice and simple and boring.",

Are you changing the mix of the Q4 price points for this year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nTricky. You'll see some of the lower price points. We're not doing it on purpose. I think, Neil, do you have anything to say on this subject?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Neil Rossy (Executives)】\nNo.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nNo? We react according to the products that are put in front of us, the value we can give and evaluate the assortment that should be offered. There's nothing extraordinary about what's happening. And certain lower price point -- let's say, dollar items, may have to go to $1.25. But we measure that very carefully and study that very carefully because we're still a dollar store and our -- from our perspective, and like to stay at -- to have certainly an assortment of items at that price point. So nothing special.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Irene Nattel (Analysts)】\nAnd just one final question, if I might. Clearly, the decline in oil prices is highly topical this at time. I'm just wondering whether if oil -- if prices stay in and around current levels whether that would have a meaningful and material impact on your transportation costs, recognizing that you do an awful lot by rail.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nRight. So we'll see. If there -- if we can benefit from lower costs, so be it. But again, that will help us in the savings. And hopefully, we -- if there are savings, we can transfer that into the value proposition.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nYes. I don't expect that to happen. As you know, when prices of oil goes up, transportation costs go up because they use that as the reason for increased prices. When they go down, you hear nothing from them. So -- and that's life. It's the same as negotiating prices in the Orient. We're hearing about even price increases on incoming inbound freight from the Orient. So -- and we're fighting that with the normal logic that should be used. Prices are down, oil is down, et cetera, et cetera. But they still come back and say, well, volume is up and this and that. So there's always that discussion, if you put it that way. So I don't expect huge savings coming from the reduction in oil prices. That's all.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Durran (Analysts)】\nAnd we're all going to stay focused on the same issues, I'm sure. But can you give us any idea as to what role the exchange rate played in the average basket inflation and what impact it might have had on gross margin?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nNo. It's hard to measure it directly, Jim. But obviously, as we said, the more we manage the margin, the better chances we have at protecting that top line or stimulating the top line growth. So we did absorb part of that additional cost, but to say specifically what the impact is...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nLook, the Canadian dollar will create inflation here in Canada, the reduction in its value, no question. So it's invariably creating some inflation in our prices, and that's to be expected. To what extent, how much, that's hard to measure. And we don't measure it, we just -- trying to work on certain margins, certain value. And -- but if your question is, is it creating some inflation, inflation in our concept as opposed to others? Yes, it is. Not as opposed to others, but it is within ours. And I would think that it's causing inflation throughout the retail market industry.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nRight. We'd be all on the same level playing field.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Durran (Analysts)】\nYes. So would you have seen your average basket in Q3 being up versus Q2 or sequentially...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nIt is...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nIt is up compared to Q2.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Durran (Analysts)】\nAnd how much?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nI don't know if that's normal. If you went back in history, if those 2 Qs are -- I don't know that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nYes. We don't have the -- to the -- your question, Jim, is what part of the currency management had an impact on the basket size in Q3 compared to Q2, for example.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Durran (Analysts)】\nMuch better worded than my question, yes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nNo. Well, the answer is the same though. So...\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Durran (Analysts)】\nNo, I appreciate that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nOkay.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Durran (Analysts)】\nOkay. No, I appreciate the color.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nYes, it's hard. Yes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Durran (Analysts)】\nLooking out on your buyback activity, I think you made a comment last quarter that in terms of leverage, ideally, you'd like to maintain your current debt rating, and so adding more debt leverage is not necessarily a conscious intent at this time. How do you see the use of your free cash flow? I mean, you obviously are generating a decent amount. When you look into next year, do you see allocating more free cash flow to buyback or sort of maintaining current course of buyback intensity?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nRight. Well, yes. So we continue to favor buybacks. So we do -- especially in Q4, that's a period where you do generate most of the cash flow -- free cash flow. And -- but as the EBITDA continues growing, that opens up more leverage opportunity, if you want. And the idea is to remain within BBB stable range. And -- but over time, we will be able to continue leveraging up, given the increase in EBITDA also.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Durran (Analysts)】\nAnd I know it's early, but FX 2016 -- 2015, 2016, do you still expect 70 to 80 stores a year and the majority of your CapEx being skewed to that? And the infamous question always gets asked about, what about -- do you see in Western Canada?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nOkay.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nNot yet. I can't see that for the next few years.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nAnd just to be clear, for this year, Larry, we're talking about 70 to 80 stores. And next year, for F '16, also 70 to 80 stores.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nThis year, yes, '15, 75 to 80 stores. Next year, well, it's hard to put an exact number, but certainly, 70 to 80 stores. Hopefully, closer to the 80, but 70 to 80.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Durran (Analysts)】\nNo extraordinary other items that would affect CapEx spend then?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nNo. If we -- no. The average CapEx intensity ratio, excluding the growth CapEx, is pretty stable and should be expected for the years to come, unless we would announce something special, which we don't see right now. And no, so nothing special next year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Derek Dley (Analysts)】\nCan you guys comment on some of your SG&A initiatives, the Kronos labor management system, implementation of the POS and how the -- your sort of data analytics surrounding that are really driving or are they really driving this impressive SG&A leverage that we've seen in the last few quarters?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nYes. We can comment, but, I mean, it's the same answers, really. It's with the same system. It's just that we're -- as we've stated in the past and as I've mentioned to you in the past, is that we continue to leverage our POS, turning on functionalities, just getting better and better at scheduling, working in stores. We -- there's a speed at which you roll out initiatives. There's so much that our employees can absorb at a time, and we do it cautiously and we take our time to do it correctly. And hopefully, we can sustain -- just from of the labor scheduling tool, hopefully continue to generate savings in the future. We've got other initiatives going on. Johanne is very involved in the stores and looking at and bringing ideas for new initiatives. So hopefully, we'll see that coming in into the future. But for the time being, it's the same -- more or less, the same tools that generate the savings that you've seen and that, hopefully, we can continue seeing it in the future.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Peter Sklar (Analysts)】\nMichael, have you done any more work on what the impact is going to be on your procurement when Canada changes its trade status with China? I think that's effective January 1, so duty is going to go up on a lot of the items you bring in. I mean, you've said that -- I think in the past when we've talked about this on the call, you said you haven't been able to quantify it yet. So I'm just wondering if you've done any work and what you can talk about.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nYes. We -- when we have -- we were able to quantify it, we didn't want to disclose it. We know and we told you it wasn't material. What you can anticipate in Q4 will be a slight nonmaterial increase in inventory because we will be or have been prebuying just before the rates kick in. But after that, for the rest, it's business as usual. Nothing special going on. No words to have with that. I mean, the currency has been -- had a much, much larger impact than the duties with have.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nYes, it's just simply another headwind like foreign exchange, and we manage them in the same way. So there's not -- we don't manage those duty increases in any different way. The buyers are well aware of them, well aware of what they have factor in for next year and that's what they do.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Peter Sklar (Analysts)】\nDo you think the imposition of the duties will cause your category mix to change at all?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\n0.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Keith Howlett (Analysts)】\nI was wondering, in terms of your suppliers in China, whether you're noticing any difference or whether they're being impacted by excess capacity or lack of capacity or just what the situation is there.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nWell, I could give you the long answer to a very short one, 0. We've noticed 0. No impact, no change, no difference. Absolutely none. Neil?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Neil Rossy (Executives)】\nNone.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Keith Howlett (Analysts)】\nGreat. And then just in terms of the freight situation. Some people have been mentioning tight situation in the West Coast. Have you pretty much already brought in all your inventory and so there's no issue?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nI'm not aware of any issue. That was brought up to my attention this week by someone, are you -- are we having problems getting merchandise through Vancouver because of the problems they're having apparently in the States. So the answer is none. We're having 0 impact.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Keith Howlett (Analysts)】\nAnd then just on the Christmas season, is the gift card program a significant part of your business or is it sort of steady-state?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nNo, it's steady. It's not -- nothing major.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nYes, I'd agree.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Keith Howlett (Analysts)】\nAnd then just on the...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nOkay. Last question, Keith, please.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Keith Howlett (Analysts)】\nYes. Just on the competitive landscape, are you noticing anything different on the party side of the business? Do you see some activity there by Party City and others? Are you feeling any change there on your sales pattern?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nI'll answer that one. We haven't. And I've spoken to my -- to our party people and they haven't. So I guess the answer is no. Should we be? That's a question, Keith?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Keith Howlett (Analysts)】\nOh, well, I don't think so.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nOkay, no. No, the answer is no.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Patricia Baker (Analysts)】\nJust a quick question for you, Michael, and I appreciate Larry clarifying for us that we would still have store openings this year of 75 to 80. Is there something that happened in the third quarter that saw you with a slight flowing of the openings or there was nothing unusual?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nYou can speak to all the landlords that we deal with and that's the answer. It's as simple as that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Patricia Baker (Analysts)】\nOkay. That's good clarification.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nIt's just timing.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Patricia Baker (Analysts)】\nOkay.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nYes, it's just timing.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Patricia Baker (Analysts)】\nOkay. Excellent. Great.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nThank you, Patricia.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Hartley (Analysts)】\nAnd Larry, you can ask me questions and make my job easier, if you want. New store contribution, I don't know if it was covered in the first few questions in the call, but I was just wondering if you can characterize what we're seeing in terms of new store contributions if it's fairly steady and is that on a per-store basis, per square foot basis? Because I do know that some of your new stores are maybe a bit smaller.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nYes. They were last year. This year it happens not to be. And it's just -- it's not by design, it's just by opportunity. And I think we're back to a, more or less, normal size this year. We're close to 10,000-foot average. Last year may have been a little less because we got a bunch of stores in the metropolitan areas of Toronto and we took them. I think that answers your question. I'm not sure if there was something -- and as far as new stores, the pace was a little slower this year. We'll have a lot of stores in the fourth quarter because that's -- I just answered that question to the previous caller. But I think that the return on investment or the...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nIt is more or less the same.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nMore or less the same as it has been for the...\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Hartley (Analysts)】\nGreat. A pretty steady state. And so beautifully boring goes the story. And then just beyond this existing growth story, could you talk a little bit about -- maybe what the company thinks in terms of stepping out and looking for other growth opportunities? Obviously, Central America is something you're looking at and working on, maybe you can update us on that. And then have you thought about other retail formats or importing, exporting opportunities where you can use some of your core strengths and leverage them?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nIs this where you want me to ask you the question? Michael, you want to make a comment on that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nYes, yes. Okay. So in terms of -- so again, there are 2 -- the answer is boringly the same. So it's steady as she goes. Central America, again, still not material. We continue to work our way there. Things are looking very good, in line with our expectations. So hopefully, we can sustain that over time. And for the rest, we do a lot of homework on a lot of stuff, but nothing to discuss at this time.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nCentral America, basically we've concentrated in El Salvador. I think we're about to go into Guatemala. So if you want to come with me on the next trip, that would be fine, David. Yes, I know. I know. I know. You'd rather not, I understand.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Hartley (Analysts)】\nI'll check the budget. And so you were at 15 stores, if I recall before, does this mean this -- if that's correct, is this number 16?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nNo, no, no.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nWe don't comment on that. But you can assume it's going to go up, obviously, but we're not going to comment on details.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Hartley (Analysts)】\nNo details.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nBoring.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nI told you it would be boring. So...\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chris Li (Analysts)】\nI think I read somewhere that your company recently joined the United Grocers buying group. I'm just wondering if -- what type of benefits or if you can help us understand the rationale behind that and maybe quantify any substantial savings you expect from that group?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Neil Rossy (Executives)】\nSure. Chris, it's Neil. We joined UGI basically for one reason alone, which was to take advantage of the greater buying power of the buying group. None of our costs are shared. We have no intentions of changing our product mix or our price point. And as you know, unlike the balance of our assortment, our food offering, they're sold only up to $2 as opposed to $3. So we just joined for that and only that reason. If there are other benefits over time, then they'll be icing on the cake.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chris Li (Analysts)】\nOkay, that's helpful. And my second question is, I know that in the past you've said that as your company gets bigger, you have more clouts with the national suppliers. Are you able to share with us what is your national brand penetration currently versus, say, 12 months ago? And I guess my question is really trying to understand, there's no question you're getting more national products into your stores, is that having a material benefit with respect to attracting more traffic into your stores?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Neil Rossy (Executives)】\nNo, we haven't seen that. We basically have kept the same buying philosophy, which is we have a sprinkling of national brands across as many categories as we can to add that option for our customer that has the luxury to pay the slightly higher costs that are associated with the national brand, even if they are at competitive prices within our stores. And we continue to buy them when the opportunities make sense. But there is no change in strategy.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chris Li (Analysts)】\nOkay. And my last question is, can you comment on how your mature stores, say, older than 5 or 7 years, how are those stores performing from a same-store sales growth perspective versus your overall average? Are they comping positive? And so are they closer, similar to your average for the company?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nYes. It's more or less similar.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kenric Tyghe (Analysts)】\nIf I could, Michael, I would like -- given the -- your success of navigating some of the wage inflation headwinds, the amount of runway you've highlighted by way of initiatives or other, can you help me understand or walk us through what's stopping you or should stop us from thinking of your sort of G&A margins in more of a -- perhaps, a 16% to 17% than a 17% to 18% sort of range? I just look at the amount of runway you appear to have and how the ease with which, and I use the term cautiously, you've appeared to navigate the headwinds to date and I'm trying to reconcile sort of what would stop us thinking of the business as something of a further improvement even on your G&A leverage from where we are today or where you're sort of guiding to or thinking about today.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nYes. The key word there is cautious and you used it. So go ahead, Michael.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nRight. No, I think that, obviously, there's a minimum of hours that you need to work in-store, so there are some limits. But hopefully, we haven't reached that. We believe that there's still room to continue improving, and again, depending on headwinds. But there's also another element, is that as we implement new initiatives to sustain the efficiency in the future, these are costs that we have to record over time. These are new initiatives and the timing of the recording of those might impact some quarters more than others. So there's -- it's not just that we have finished spending money on initiatives and now we're just reaping the benefits of those in the future. We need to make further -- make future further investments to continue improving over time. There's at store level that's also on the logistics side that we're thinking about and doing homework on.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nYes, let me add to that. You have to appreciate that the dollar store business is a labor-intensive business. We are placing items on our stores between $1 and $3 on our stores -- on our counters in our stores, and that's a lot of labor that is required. So there are only so many initiatives that we can do before -- unless you're working on some robotic replenishment system. We still have to open boxes, put the merchandise on the counters and then pass those -- pass that through the cash, and that's all labor that cannot be eliminated. Again, I don't know where technology is going, but it's unlikely. So to get these labor -- this SG&A down, it's going to get harder and harder and we have to be more and more careful and cautious. We have to check out our customers more rapidly, give them more satisfaction. Make it easier to shop at a Dollarama than it is at the competition, for example. And that will take more technology that we're working on. But that may not decrease the amount of labor, it just may increase our efficiency. So it will come out to 0 at the end. That's all I can say on the labor question, Kenric.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kenric Tyghe (Analysts)】\nMuch appreciated. Makes a lot of sense. Just a quick follow-up with respect the competitive landscape, and you touched on it, your relative experience. Is it safe to assume that at this point the competitive landscape is such that there wouldn't be any need in the foreseeable future for increased spend by way of some of the more traditional options, marketing spend on flyers or otherwise? I mean, that proposition, to my mind, is still -- is that compelling relative to anything I see in the market that I don't believe that would be the case. Or is that a reasonable basis to be looking at sort of at least in the next couple of years?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nNot looking at it. We don't think so. In 2 years, what can happen 2 years after that, we're up to 4 years now, I don't know. But I don't particularly like the idea. It brings a whole bureaucracy to the system and dissatisfaction that created for our customers because you can't advertise and not have, and that seems to be the history of advertising. So I think we're going to keep it, as long as possible, nice and simple and boring.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you, Dorothy, and good morning, everyone. On the call today are Rick Dreiling, our Chairman and CEO; and David Tehle, our CFO. We will first go through our prepared remarks, and then we will open the call up for questions. Our earnings release issued today can be found on our website at dollargeneral.com under Investor Information, Press Releases.\r\nLet me caution you that today's comments will include forward-looking statements about our expectations, plans, predictions and other nonhistorical matters, such as our 2014 forecasted financial result and capital expenditures; our planned fiscal 2014 and 2015 operating, merchandising and store growth initiatives; our beliefs regarding future consumer economic trends; and various matters relating to our proposal to acquire Family Dollar. Important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those reflected in or implied by our forward-looking statement are included in our earnings release issued this morning, our 2013 Form 10-K, which was filed on March 20, 2014, and in the comments that are made on this call. We encourage you to read these documents. You should not unduly rely on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of today's date. Dollar General disclaims any obligation to update or revise any information discussed in this call.\r\nWe will also reference certain financial measures not derived in accordance with GAAP. Where available, reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in this morning's earnings release, which, I had mentioned, is posted on dollargeneral.com.\r\nThe purpose of today's call is to discuss Dollar General's performance for the fiscal third quarter and outlook for the fiscal year. At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call up to your questions on those subjects. During today's Q&A, we will not discuss our proposed acquisition of Family Dollar or related matters. [Operator Instructions]\r\nNow it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Rick.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Mary Winn. Good morning, everyone. This morning, we announced the results for the third quarter of fiscal 2014. David and I will discuss the highlights of the quarter, then I will address our current initiatives and provide an update on where we are with the Family Dollar transaction.\r\nFor the third quarter, net sales grew 7.8% to $4.72 billion. Comp store sales increased 2.8% as compared to the 2013 third quarter, with increases in both traffic and average ticket, extending that trend to 27 consecutive quarters. Our comp sales trajectory improved as we moved through the quarter, and we have seen that trend accelerate into the fourth quarter. We had a good back-to-school season, along with strong sell-through for Halloween. And importantly, we are seeing a significant step-up in comp sales as we start the fourth quarter. Momentum has built as we lap the SNAP benefit cuts in the fourth quarter of 2013, and we expect to achieve a comp sales growth of approximately 5% for the fourth quarter. Perishables and tobacco continue to be the largest contributors to same-store sales growth. Tobacco has continued to show very strong comp growth beyond its first full year anniversary. \r\nOur non-consumables were positive for the quarter, marking the third consecutive quarter of improvement. We are extremely pleased with sales growth in our home and apparel categories this year. I believe our efforts on current trends and affordability in these areas have already begun to take hold with our customer. Our gross profit rate of 30.1% of sales was 18 basis points less than last year's third quarter. While this was below our expectations due to higher promotional markdowns across consumable categories and end-of-season inventory clearance, this represented a significant improvement over our recent quarterly trend. Finally, adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter increased 10% to $0.79 per share.\r\nWe've updated our guidance to reflect performance through the third quarter and our outlook for the fourth quarter for both sales and earnings. We continue to have a strong outlook for the fourth quarter. On the comp sales front, our initiatives, coupled with our commitment to everyday low price, continue to resonate with our customers. We kicked off the holiday season with a 3-day ad the week prior to Thanksgiving and continue to emphasize our savings over an 8-day period centered on Thanksgiving Day. We offered exclusive holiday savings across gifts, toys, electronics, clothing, decor, baking and additional categories for every holiday need. We are pleased with our customers' response to these promotional events.\r\nAs we lap some of the retail challenges from the fourth quarter of 2013, we are seeing broad-based momentum build in our business. I'll talk more about our operating initiatives in a moment, but now I'd like to turn the call over to David.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. First, let me walk you through our gross margin performance. Gross profit increased by 7.2% as a percentage of sales and decreased by 18 basis points to 30.1% in the 2014 third quarter compared to the 2013 third quarter. Our product category with the lowest gross profit rate is consumables, and this category continues to comprise a larger portion of our net sales primarily as a result of increased sales of lower margin tobacco and perishable products. The gross profit rate decrease was also impacted by an increase in markdowns due to increased promotional and end-of-season inventory clearance activity. These factors were partially offset by higher initial markups on inventory purchases and improved inventory shrink. We recorded a LIFO provision of $2.2 million in the 2014 period compared to a LIFO benefit of $3.7 million in the 2013 period. This equates to 13 basis points of negative pressure on gross margin percentage. As compared to our forecast for gross profit, we successfully mitigated the impacts of the West Coast port slowdown and driver shortages on gross margin due in part to lower stem miles from the successful opening of our Bethel, Pennsylvania distribution center earlier this year.\r\nSG&A expense was 21.8% of sales in the 2014 period compared to 21.4% in the 2013 period. For the third quarter 2014, SG&A expense included expenses of $8 million or 17 basis points related to our proposed acquisition of Family Dollar. The remaining 21 basis points of SG&A rate increase are attributable to increases in rents, utilities and incentive compensation expenses. Offsetting these items were convenience fees charged to customers for cash back and debit card transactions and retail labor expense, which increased at a rate lower than our increase in sales. The third quarter tax rate was 36.5% compared to last year's effective tax rate of 35.6%. Both years included benefits from the reduction of reserves that were established in 2009. These amounted to $4.7 million in the 2014 quarter and $6 million in the 2013 quarter. Excluding these adjustments, the increase in our tax rate relates to the expiration of various federal jobs tax credit programs and the impact of certain nondeductible expenses related to the proposed acquisition of Family Dollar.\r\nYear-to-date, we generated cash from operations of $841 million. That's up $80 million from last year's 39-week period. Total capital expenditures were $289 million, including $104 million for improvements, upgrades, remodels and relocations of existing stores; $86 million related to new leased stores primarily for leasehold improvements, fixtures and equipment; $36 million for distribution and transportation-related capital expenditures; $29 million for stores built by the company; and $28 million for information systems upgrades and technology-related projects. Our share repurchase program is on hold as we await the outcome of our proposed transaction with Family Dollar.\r\nTurning now to guidance. Top line sales for the full year 2014 are expected to increase approximately 8%, at the low end of our previous guidance range, and same-store sales are now expected to increase at or slightly below the low end of our previous range of 3.0% to 3.5%, with same-store sales growth of approximately 5% forecast for the fourth quarter. We expect adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year to be in the middle of our previous full year adjusted earnings per share range of $3.45 to $3.55. This excludes any cost related to the potential FDO transaction. In addition, it assumes no additional share repurchases in the fourth quarter. It does assume the reinstatement of the Work Opportunity Tax Credit back to the beginning of the year, which has always been included in our guidance for our effective tax rate for the year. The impact of the tax credit is approximately $0.04 per share. \r\nFor the year, we're on track to open approximately 700 new stores, and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $400 million, which is down from our earlier expectations due primarily to the timing of the build-out of our new San Antonio, Texas distribution center and lower overall cost for new stores.\r\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Rick.\n\n---\n\nThank you, David. As we have said for many quarters, driving unit sales growth is key to our long-term strategy, and I'm pleased to report that we continue to make progress in this area. Once again, in Nielsen syndicated data, we have grown both unit and dollar share in the mid- to high single digits in the most recent 4-week and 12-week periods on top of our long track record of share growth. I believe this is attributable to our commitment to affordability. With our focus on affordability, we are offering customers to trade down on purchase price. For instance, in key categories such as food, paper, home cleaning and pet, unit growth is significantly ahead of sales growth in the most recent 12-week period. There is no doubt we may have sacrificed some sales as we look to drive units. Given the importance of unit growth and transaction growth as leading indicators of relevancy with our customers and of our future success, we believe this is the right trade-off for us.\r\nAnother factor impacting our comp sales growth worth mentioning is that we have had essentially no inflation. The foundation of everything we do at Dollar General is grounded in serving our customers. We remain committed as ever to providing our customers with everyday low prices they can count on. We want to make sure that our customers know that they can find nearly all of their everyday items in our small box convenience stores. Our customers are the first place we start as we build our merchandising plans for the coming year. While on paper, it appears that the economy is improving, the low to middle income consumer, who is our core customer, continues to look ways -- looks for ways to manage her budget as she works to prioritize her spending, and she trusts that we are on her side to help her stretch her budget. Keep in mind she had a tough fourth quarter last year with a number of headwinds that are starting to moderate year-over-year, including SNAP benefit reduction, challenging weather, higher energy costs, reduction in unemployment benefits and the lingering effects on consumer spending from the 2% payroll tax increase in 2013.\r\nAs I reflect on our trends for the year, I believe that we underestimated the impact of these cumulative headwinds on our customer. As a result, there's no doubt that affordability is and will continue to be a focus of our core customer. Our renewed focus on $1 to $5 items continues to gain traction. We had more than 75% of our SKUs or 78% of our sales for the third quarter that were items priced at $5 or less. This is important as we know we trade more customers with the $1 fixed price retail concept than any other small box retailer.\r\nBeyond that, we are continuing to add items with approximately 80 SKUs under our Smart & Simple brand at entry-level price points across 26 merchandise categories. In addition to the Smart & Simple brand, we continue to strategically introduce new $1 price point items on the shelf in key consumable categories, such as food, home cleaning and paper products, that are focused on affordability. All in, SKU counts in our $1 section in the store have increased more than 50% as compared to the end of 2013. New items include a combination of national brands and our private brands. In addition, we have expanded our $1 section offering to an additional 845 stores, with 96% of our stores having anywhere from 12 to 40 feet of $1 products across multiple categories, with an emphasis on health, beauty, paper, home cleaning and food. These $1 category expansions are a great way for customers to have increased purchasing power in our stores. Given that our average basket is around $11, our expanded offerings can have a positive halo effect on our customers' satisfaction as they leave our store with an additional item or 2.\r\nWe continue to be very pleased with the performance of our $5 or less price point assortment on our non-consumable categories, which represent about 60% of our merchandise offering. This clear focus on expandable consumption items at affordable price points has contributed to solid growth in our home and apparel sales this year.\r\nAs a result of these merchandise changes, we are seeing improvements in category sell-through rates. Non-consumables are important to our sales mix as we strive to enhance our gross profit rate. In the coming year, our plans have been developed to advance expandable consumption items in multiple categories, including storage, candles and domestics. In addition, we are in the midst of repackaging our private brands across both select consumable and non-consumable categories. The goal of the repackaging is to enhance our customers' perception of our private brand quality and value for the price. We had a test launch of the new packaging in select products with very encouraging results, and the majority of new repackaged items will be on the shelf in 2015. We continue to grow our private brands, with SKU count of 6% and penetration of over 24%.\r\nWe continue to look ways to leverage technology and engage consumers. We completed the initial rollout of our digital coupon capabilities in August and began to aggressively launch that program at the end of September and throughout October with our Fast Way to Save promotion. To date, sign-ups have significantly exceeded our expectations, and we have already hit our target for the year-end. With nearly 18 million digital coupons downloaded already, activations and redemptions are having a strong impact on sales of coupon-specific items. In 2015, we will be able to use the data captured from this program like a loyalty card but without the incremental cost. For instance, insights from a customer's shopping trip can be used to customize individual promotions to drive trips and baskets. This is an exciting opportunity that we should be able to capitalize on in 2015.\r\nI am pleased to report that we had favorable results and improving our inventory shrink performance in the third quarter. Over time, shrink improvement continues to be an opportunity as we remain steadfastly committed to reducing our shrink levels on a store-by-store basis. The store format and layout, SKU rationalization of high shrink items, defensive merchandising and exception-based reporting all play a role as we look for shrink improvement going forward.\r\nDriving productivity at the store level is important as ever as our overarching goal is to create time savings that we can reinvest to better manage our stores and service our customers. In order to enable productivity gains, we are elevating our category management processes to optimize all areas of the store beyond the planograms to include all shelf and end cap displays. Over the last several years, we have made significant strides in the productivity of our planograms through SKU selection and ongoing refinement. We feel we've established a strong foundation in our planograms that we can refine periodically. We are concentrating on simplifying work at the store level by reducing the complexity of planogram resets.\r\nAt Dollar General, real estate is a core strength. Our real estate model is disciplined and focused on financial returns. Year-to-date, we have opened up 617 new stores and relocated or remodeled 874 stores, including approximately 380 life-cycle remodels. The life-cycle remodels are focused on our legacy smaller footprint stores and allow us to improve adjacencies and planogram layout. These stores are getting closer to the same sales lift as we get in our full remodel with a much lower investment, resulting in returns on the life-cycle remodel that are over 200 basis points higher than our full remodels. Given these strong returns, we plan to significantly expand our life-cycle remodel program in 2015. In addition, in the first quarter of 2015, we will be utilizing our merchandising predictive technology capabilities in over 250 of our life-cycle remodels to optimize our space and SKU productivity. So we expect these remodels to drive even higher sales.\r\nIn 2015, we plan to open approximately 730 new stores and to relocate or remodel 875 stores with a priority on life-cycle remodels. In total, square footage growth is expected to be about 6%. We will expand our footprint into 3 new states in 2015, Maine, Rhode Island and Oregon, as we use our real estate model to identify winning sites for our traditional Dollar General format. We are right where we want to be as we enter the new year. Our real estate pipeline is 100% committed, and we're already working on 2016. Our new store productivity continues to be about 85% of our comp base, and we're looking forward to successful store openings in 2015. Also, in 2015, we will open our 13th distribution center as we continue to invest in our infrastructure to support our growth. Site work has started on the new distribution center in San Antonio, Texas, and we plan to begin shipping from that distribution center in late 2015. We have exciting plans for 2015 and have lots of opportunities ahead of us.\r\nNow turning briefly to our proposal to acquire Family Dollar. We are as committed as ever to this acquisition and believe that the synergies we expect to achieve through the combination of these 2 companies would benefit Dollar General shareholders and, importantly, the consumer for many years to come. We're working hard to be in a position to complete this transaction and begin the process of combining our 2 companies. To that end, as we've stated, we are actively engaging with the FTC and believe that we are making good progress on that front. We filed our HSR notification with the FTC in mid-September. Since the filing, we have provided the FTC with tens of thousands of documents and have had a number of very valuable and productive discussions. Family Dollar shareholders are currently scheduled to vote on the Dollar Tree transaction at a special meeting on December 23. We are very aware of the calendar, and we look forward to sharing more information, with sufficient time, for Family Dollar shareholders to make an informed voting decision at the December 23 shareholder meeting.\r\nOur 75th anniversary has been a time to reflect on our company's rich heritage and our mission of serving others. It's also an exciting time to look to the future and envision what the next 75 years will bring for Dollar General. My sincere thanks and appreciation go out to the 106,400 Dollar General employees as we are in the midst of the busiest season of retail. Over the years, Dollar General employees have built this business through hard work and dedication to our mission, and we owe them a great deal of gratitude. Thank you for an amazing 75 years.\r\nMary Winn, I'll now open the call up for questions.\n\n---\n\nYes. And as previously mentioned, we will not discuss our proposed acquisition of Family Dollar or related matters. [Operator Instructions] We'll now open up the call for questions. Dorothy?",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Mary Winn Pilkington (Executives)】\nThank you, Dorothy, and good morning, everyone. On the call today are Rick Dreiling, our Chairman and CEO; and David Tehle, our CFO. We will first go through our prepared remarks, and then we will open the call up for questions. Our earnings release issued today can be found on our website at dollargeneral.com under Investor Information, Press Releases.\r\nLet me caution you that today's comments will include forward-looking statements about our expectations, plans, predictions and other nonhistorical matters, such as our 2014 forecasted financial result and capital expenditures; our planned fiscal 2014 and 2015 operating, merchandising and store growth initiatives; our beliefs regarding future consumer economic trends; and various matters relating to our proposal to acquire Family Dollar. Important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those reflected in or implied by our forward-looking statement are included in our earnings release issued this morning, our 2013 Form 10-K, which was filed on March 20, 2014, and in the comments that are made on this call. We encourage you to read these documents. You should not unduly rely on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of today's date. Dollar General disclaims any obligation to update or revise any information discussed in this call.\r\nWe will also reference certain financial measures not derived in accordance with GAAP. Where available, reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in this morning's earnings release, which, I had mentioned, is posted on dollargeneral.com.\r\nThe purpose of today's call is to discuss Dollar General's performance for the fiscal third quarter and outlook for the fiscal year. At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call up to your questions on those subjects. During today's Q&A, we will not discuss our proposed acquisition of Family Dollar or related matters. [Operator Instructions]\r\nNow it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Rick.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nThank you, Mary Winn. Good morning, everyone. This morning, we announced the results for the third quarter of fiscal 2014. David and I will discuss the highlights of the quarter, then I will address our current initiatives and provide an update on where we are with the Family Dollar transaction.\r\nFor the third quarter, net sales grew 7.8% to $4.72 billion. Comp store sales increased 2.8% as compared to the 2013 third quarter, with increases in both traffic and average ticket, extending that trend to 27 consecutive quarters. Our comp sales trajectory improved as we moved through the quarter, and we have seen that trend accelerate into the fourth quarter. We had a good back-to-school season, along with strong sell-through for Halloween. And importantly, we are seeing a significant step-up in comp sales as we start the fourth quarter. Momentum has built as we lap the SNAP benefit cuts in the fourth quarter of 2013, and we expect to achieve a comp sales growth of approximately 5% for the fourth quarter. Perishables and tobacco continue to be the largest contributors to same-store sales growth. Tobacco has continued to show very strong comp growth beyond its first full year anniversary. \r\nOur non-consumables were positive for the quarter, marking the third consecutive quarter of improvement. We are extremely pleased with sales growth in our home and apparel categories this year. I believe our efforts on current trends and affordability in these areas have already begun to take hold with our customer. Our gross profit rate of 30.1% of sales was 18 basis points less than last year's third quarter. While this was below our expectations due to higher promotional markdowns across consumable categories and end-of-season inventory clearance, this represented a significant improvement over our recent quarterly trend. Finally, adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter increased 10% to $0.79 per share.\r\nWe've updated our guidance to reflect performance through the third quarter and our outlook for the fourth quarter for both sales and earnings. We continue to have a strong outlook for the fourth quarter. On the comp sales front, our initiatives, coupled with our commitment to everyday low price, continue to resonate with our customers. We kicked off the holiday season with a 3-day ad the week prior to Thanksgiving and continue to emphasize our savings over an 8-day period centered on Thanksgiving Day. We offered exclusive holiday savings across gifts, toys, electronics, clothing, decor, baking and additional categories for every holiday need. We are pleased with our customers' response to these promotional events.\r\nAs we lap some of the retail challenges from the fourth quarter of 2013, we are seeing broad-based momentum build in our business. I'll talk more about our operating initiatives in a moment, but now I'd like to turn the call over to David.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: David Tehle (Executives)】\nThank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. First, let me walk you through our gross margin performance.

To that end, as we've stated, we are actively engaging with the FTC and believe that we are making good progress on that front. We filed our HSR notification with the FTC in mid-September. Since the filing, we have provided the FTC with tens of thousands of documents and have had a number of very valuable and productive discussions. Family Dollar shareholders are currently scheduled to vote on the Dollar Tree transaction at a special meeting on December 23. We are very aware of the calendar, and we look forward to sharing more information, with sufficient time, for Family Dollar shareholders to make an informed voting decision at the December 23 shareholder meeting.\r\nOur 75th anniversary has been a time to reflect on our company's rich heritage and our mission of serving others. It's also an exciting time to look to the future and envision what the next 75 years will bring for Dollar General. My sincere thanks and appreciation go out to the 106,400 Dollar General employees as we are in the midst of the busiest season of retail. Over the years, Dollar General employees have built this business through hard work and dedication to our mission, and we owe them a great deal of gratitude. Thank you for an amazing 75 years.\r\nMary Winn, I'll now open the call up for questions.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Mary Winn Pilkington (Executives)】\nYes. And as previously mentioned, we will not discuss our proposed acquisition of Family Dollar or related matters. [Operator Instructions] We'll now open up the call for questions. Dorothy?",
      "transcript_text3": "Just wondering if you can comment a little bit on the seasonal category trends throughout the quarter, how they perform relative to expectations, whether it was the same top cadence of improvement. And then also, expectations going into the fourth quarter, it looks, over the past few years, seasonal has been relatively weaker in the fourth quarter relative to other categories. So should we -- as you look at your plans and trends to date, is that a structural trend we should expect to continue? Or is that more of a multiyear easy comparison that we should think about?\n\n---\n\nYes, great questions. We had a very good Halloween and a good back-to-school, really pleased with that. I will tell you the bigger seasons have slowed down a bit, summer and spring, and of course, we experienced a little bit of slow traffic last year on Christmas. I will tell you we have an offering this year on the Christmas side that is much different than last year, and it's focused on affordability, many, many items below $5. And again, this idea that the $1 price point is incredibly important to our customer, a lot of items focused on $1, and we -- I don't see a structural change yet. We're looking for good things with seasonal in the fourth quarter, so we'll see how it plays out.\n\n---\n\nObviously, a lot of focus on gas prices, but also, on the competitive environment. In the third quarter, we saw some improvement from some other discounters, at least a sequential improvement from the second to the third quarter. So my question is, what do you think the possibility is that as gas prices decline that you'll start to see some customers shift out of the discount convenience channel into other areas, especially after you've seen some massive customer migration into your channel over the last several years?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think that the way I look at gas prices, number one, you're not going to see -- it takes a while for the consumer to really believe they've got extra change in their pocket. It's going to take a series of trips to the gas station to realize there's a little more money there. I think the other thing to take into account would be that it makes the customer more moldable. They obviously have the wherewithal to search for more deals across more channels, but at the end of the day, we're on our 27th year of same-store sales growth. We've had good times, we've had bad times, good economies, high gas prices, low gas prices. And our customer always seems to search us out. So I think the work we've done on affordability, I think we have hit that one out of the park. The unit growth that we are seeing is great, and again, I think as long as we stay focused on affordability, the customers can always be searching for us.\n\n---\n\nThat's helpful. My follow question is, now that you have focused on affordability and building units, how do you build the basket or get them to trade back up after you've introduced the customer to all of these new products? Or is that not the focus?\n\n---\n\nYes, I'd tell you the focus is on transactions and it's focused on units. I -- my personal feeling on this, Michael, is I never want to be in a position where I tell you my traffic is down and my basket is up, and I think that's when you start to get yourself into a bind. Our basket has been around $11 every year I've been here, and what we're seeing is that our customer's coming back more often to us.\n\n---\n\nObviously, you've had the lower gas prices. You've also seen a little bit of recovery in some of the labor metrics for, let's call it, non-college-educated consumers. Let's call it blue-collar kind of people. Rick, when you think about kind of all the gives and takes on the consumer side, I mean, how are you guys kind of thinking about it? And how do you think it rolls through 2015?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think the middle-income, the low-income customer, I do think there's still -- I still think they've got some issues. I don't believe they have them to the magnitude they had them last year. I do feel better about the consumer, but I'm still a little more cautious. I'm cautiously optimistic, and I think it's interesting, when we -- you can almost go back last year and look at when the staff cuts hit and watch what happened. This year, you can see when we've lapped those staff cuts, you can see the change in consumer behavior. So again, I'm cautiously optimistic, and I think it will flow through to the retail sales line as we move through '15.\n\n---\n\nAnd when you consider kind of incremental changes for '15, I know it's becoming a bigger topic for a bunch of other retailers just in terms of some of the changes being implemented with health care, affordable care, et cetera. Have you guys thought about the potential impact that could potentially have on some of your consumer buying patterns?\n\n---\n\nYes, and again, that's why we're so committed to the affordability piece. That's why we're working so hard getting items into the store that price $5 or less or even centered around the $1 price point. The whole idea here is, I believe, affordability is going to be with us for a period of time yet, and our customer -- yes, and our customer is just always looking for a bargain.\n\n---\n\nYour focus on growing transactions, and market share makes a tremendous amount of sense. But the one problem is that Dollar General's GMROI has now dropped for 4 consecutive years and inventory is about 50% of your tangible assets. So the focus on growing share is coming at the expense of lower returns. Looking, let's say, to 2015 or 2016, are there any initiatives that could enable you to achieve both a better market share as well as a higher inventory productivity?\n\n---\n\nYes, a couple of comments on that. First of all, you have taken about -- take into account tobacco, when you look at the margin and we made a strategic decision to add tobacco, knowing what that would do overall. I think as we look forward, there are initiatives going on in foreign sourcing, in our private label as well as shrink. And as Rick mentioned in his comments, we saw some positives in shrink this quarter. So we still have the capability to add to that gross margin and that gross margin percent. Now having said that, again, I go back to what Rick said as he kicked this off, driving unit sales growth and then transaction growth will continue to be high priorities for us and what we're going to be focused on because we think ultimately, that's what our long-term shareholders want to see. But yes, there is room in margin and there are things where we continue to work on, but again, the unit growth and the transaction growth will always be at the top of the list.\n\n---\n\nAnd David, just a follow-up. You had -- in your prepared comments, you noted that in the fourth quarter, you'll get a $0.04 contribution from tax credits. So I guess, tax rate is going to be, what, 35.5%, 36%. Did you have a similar tax credit in the fourth quarter of last year?\n\n---\n\nSo what this is, is the WOTC, the Work Opportunity Tax Credit, and the way this works is these benefits expired December of last year, and we've been waiting all year for the federal government to take action on this. Last night, the House passed a bill of tax extenders by a vote of 378 to 46. That bill was now sent to the Senate, and the Senate is waiting for -- we're waiting for the Senate to take action on it. We, obviously, can't predict what the Senate will do, but if past history is any indication, more than likely, a 1-year extension will be provided. This is what we saw back in 2012 when this happened also, and then it'll be retroactively applied back. So we'll get the full year credit in the fourth quarter. As we've done our guidance for the full year, we always had this in our guidance. This isn't anything new. We felt like WOTC would come back, and we felt like it would probably be the fourth quarter simply because that's how it happened in the past. So again, it's been in there, and that's our thought process in terms of what hopefully will take place, but of course, we can't predict what the federal government will do.\n\n---\n\nExactly. And you are saying, it was included in last year's fourth quarter earnings.\n\n---\n\nIt was included all year, last year, yes. If you go back to 2012 -- the fourth quarter in 2012 because we had the situation where it got reinstated.\n\n---\n\nOkay. I'll just switch -- just trying to get to an apples-to-apples number for the fourth quarter. So -- and so you are saying that it was worth $0.04 a year ago in the fourth quarter?\n\n---\n\nNo, no, Dan. It's Mary Winn. It was even. Because that had been adopted at the end of 2012, it was retroactive for 2012, and we took that all in the fourth quarter in 2012. And at that point in time, we provided the breakout of what that was on each quarter. And as it -- and then in 2013, it was effective all year in all 4 quarters.\n\n---\n\nOkay. I think I understand, okay.\n\n---\n\nIt lasted beginning of 2014.\n\n---\n\nThere you go. Got you.\n\n---\n\nYes, it expired in December of 2013.\n\n---\n\nThat's right.\n\n---\n\nI was wondering if you could just go into a little bit more detail about how you use the data from your coupon program. I understand you see it as being similar to loyalty program but less expensive, but could you just walk us through kind of how it works, what you get and then what you do with the information?\n\n---\n\nYes. I mean, it's very similar to a loyalty card. The advantage is we don't have to massage the data, the company that we're working with does. And what you do is you offer them a coupon to see if you can change their behavior. And the example would be, Meredith, if I offer you $1 off Charmin toilet tissue and you don't respond to that coupon, right, and so then what would happen is that would mean you're buying your tissue somewhere else, and I can turn around and make the offer more rich. And it allows me -- and what happens is, I have a slate of coupons and you walk into them. And again, the coupons you choose not to opt into would indicate you're probably buying your product somewhere else, and I can enrich those offers to drive your behavior.\n\n---\n\nAnd do you get to, in some way, keep track of each individual's purchases over time?\n\n---\n\nAbsolutely. Remember, everybody enters their phone number, and it's how they register.\n\n---\n\nRight, got it. And then I just wanted to talk -- you were talking about your, I want to call them lifestyle remodels, but you know that's not what I mean -- life-cycle remodels and...\n\n---\n\nYes, sure.\n\n---\n\nAnd you talked about, I think, 250 stores where you're actually going to be changing the offering and I think probably matching it to the local community better. Could you just talk about that initiative?\n\n---\n\nYes, absolutely. So what we're going to do is we're going to take a store that's historically smaller that would go into a relocation bin, Meredith, and we're going to freshen these stores up and remodel them. And the idea here is they're going to have -- we will go into the store and analyze it and do category management. I'll use an example. This particular store in this particular market might sell more powdered detergent than liquid detergent, and what we will do is adjust the set to reflect more powder detergent, right. And there are markets, believe it or not, where powdered is still the biggest item. We have some markets where -- and I'll use the example of diapers. We have a diaper set that's exactly the same in every store across the chain, and now we'll be able to contract diapers and maybe expand on incontinence items in areas where we're closer to -- where the clientele's older. So we're really excited about this, and it's the heat-mapping concept that the guys have taken and spread out, where we can really understand what's selling and what's not on an individual store basis now.\n\n---\n\nAnd do you believe that, that drives sales or margin or both?\n\n---\n\nActually, I'd say both because what we end up doing is having the items the customer wants, and hopefully, they'll buy more of them. And then consequently, it drives more transactions. And again, I equate that, Meredith, down to more units and more transactions. We're focused on units and transactions.\n\n---\n\nSo I wanted to talk about promotional activity. It was very heavy early in Q2 and then it had moderated, but it sounds from your comments like it may have picked back up again in Q3 given the higher consumables markdowns and the end-of-season inventory clearance. If you could just give some color around the cadence of the promotional activity.\n\n---\n\nYes, I think it is -- I would say it's certainly a little higher than quarter 2, but I would not call it irrational or nearly as competitive as last year. Again, our goal has always been to come to the market with the right items, and I would look at you and say it's primarily the promotional activity right now, Matt, around CSD. And again, I think I brought up in the second or first quarter that we were going to be in line on CSD pricing, and that's where you'll find the bulk of the incremental markdown for us.\n\n---\n\nOkay, that's helpful. And then just a quick follow-up. Could you just talk to the interplay between the port issues and the driver shortages versus potential relief on freight from lower diesel prices?\n\n---\n\nYes. I will tell you that we do have some merchandise that's hung up on the West Coast. We have worked very hard and absorbed incremental transportation cost to try and get in, move that product around. I also know that we found out yesterday, some of the shippers are refusing now to go into the West Coast docks and -- which is going to create more pressure. We estimate that between the dock shortage, the higher cost to get merchandise moved, that it's about 6 to 9 basis points, but we offset that, by the way, with vessel where we were able to get our stem miles down. I do think that it's going to be a problem as we move through the fourth quarter, and it'll be a problem for everybody. We are working hard on trying to divert product to the East Coast. There's been no indication that they're going to support their brothers on the West Coast. So we're going to have to stay tuned on that one.\n\n---\n\nBut is there anything -- as you see kind of gas prices down and diesel prices down, is that big enough to potentially offset some of that? How quickly does that reset in your negotiations with the truckers?\n\n---\n\nYes. I think the down diesel prices will help, but I don't know that it's going to help depending on the magnitude of what we encounter. I think you guys all know the West Coast -- the President had said he's not going to interfere with that. He's going to let it take its own course. So I think the gas price -- the lower diesel cost will help, but it's not going to cover it all.\n\n---\n\nSo let me ask you, $5 items and under, where do you think that ultimately goes as a percent of sales, right? So how high do you think that goes in a reasonable period of time here? And then secondly, as part of that, if the number of items per basket are going up, ASP is going down, does that create some pressure, managing retail labor, right? Because you're trying to get throughput on more items with the same -- kind of the same basket size.\n\n---\n\nYes, the first part of your question, we'll let the customer decide, right. When -- why we're adding more $1 and more items under $5? We are -- we still have a broad selection of product, right. So we're still very much in the game of letting the customer make the decision of what they want. And part of the way we have -- part of the way -- part of our success over the last year has been our ability to broaden our appeal, and some of that is not only the affordability angle but also having some more stuff in there. The second part of your question, we're working on getting case packs down, which will make it easier for the retail team to absorb the incremental items. I also think that having been on retail or having been on that side of the ledger, when sales are moving in the right direction, we've always somehow managed to conquer anything that's associated with it. And Greg and his team have done a marvelous job this year, so far, of working their way through that. We also, John, have, which we rolled out this year, a very serious stocking initiative, and we're doing a much better job not only in how we ship the product to the stores, but we're doing a much better job of measuring stocking productivity.\n\n---\n\nAll right. And then just secondly, I know you don't -- you never quantify where you sit with shrink, but where do you think that opportunity sits relative to where it might have been when you first came in or relative to -- however you want to measure it? Is there still a fairly large opportunity there?\n\n---\n\nYes. It is certainly not at the level it was when I came in. It's better than that, but I see it as a significant improvement to come yet. In fact, even, John, where we were, we need to be better than where we were, if that helps.\n\n---\n\nI'd like to just ask you a question about the gross margin here. On a FIFO basis, you were actually almost flat, which is the first time and probably a couple years that we've seen that. And what I was looking to do is maybe get some additional color on the puts and takes here because the question is around affordability, for instance, and the work you're doing there. What impact on the gross margin does that have? You've mentioned no inflation in the business, but I think we have seen inflation, for instance, in consumables. So are you holding the line there? Is that having a negative impact? Right, and then how are you offsetting all of that?\n\n---\n\nYes, so let me take a shot at some of these, and then certainly, Rick will comment, too. You have to remember, in our business, we're not as based on meat and produce and things of that nature where there has been a lot more impact of inflation. Now we have had a little bit of inflation in our candy and some of our other perishables, a little bit in tobacco. And particularly, as compared to last year, where it was actually going the other way, and that's why we have this LIFO negative that I spelled out earlier on the call. But I think, as you look at it, again, I go back to the 3 basic items that help us on gross margin in terms of offsetting negatives, and that is the foreign sourcing, the private label and the shrink. And we continue to push all 3 of those in terms of trying to drive a little bit more on the gross margin and the gross margin percentage.\n\n---\n\nThe work around affordability and particularly, you think about like the $1 price point, for instance, what impact does that have on margin? And then what impact does that have on gross profit dollars?\n\n---\n\nYes. The margin on the affordability item is actually accretive. They tend to -- the $1 items tend to carry a little bit higher margin rate as do -- and the kind -- that margin rate will -- Ed, not as great when you get to the $5 items, but the lower-priced items, believe it or not, carry more. And it should help our rate.\n\n---\n\nOkay. So do you think you're at the point where we should begin to see stability in the gross margin going forward or maybe even opportunity now?\n\n---\n\nI -- that is kind of where I'm at right now, to be honest with you. The work we've done on the margin -- we all have to remember we've got cigarettes in there, which is a 17 basis points drag albeit we've cycled that, but we anticipate we have margin expansion opportunities going forward now.\n\n---\n\nJust to continue the conversation there on margins, just if you could hold our hand a little bit more on how you're thinking then about the fourth quarter, you mentioned in the prepared remarks that you were a little bit disappointed in gross margins -- or it's a little bit below, I should say, your initial expectations. Do you see sequential improvement ahead given some of the comments you just made around some of these initiatives on private label? And also, if you can just remind us, David, on how we should be thinking about the impact of the incentive comp swing within SG&A.\n\n---\n\nYes. So I think as we look at the fourth quarter, right now, we're calling margins to be relatively flat, overall, in terms of basis points, and then we do have a significant delevering of SG&A. And you hit it right on. The biggest piece of that has to do with the incentive comp. If you go back to our script from fourth quarter last year, you'll see that we spelled out that incentive comp was a 45 basis point negative -- or excuse me, a 45 basis point positive last year to us because in essence, we had a fairly sizable reserve reversal in the fourth quarter since we did not pay any incentive comp. So that's the magnitude of what we're up against this fourth quarter.\n\n---\n\nGot it. That's very helpful. And then just to go back and kind of clarify the fourth quarter comp outlook. It's certainly encouraging to hear that there has been an improvement in trends recently and that -- and we certainly acknowledge that you have an easier compare as we move through the quarter, but still, a 5% comp would be a pretty meaningful lift in acceleration on a 1-year basis. Maybe give us a little bit more color on what provides that level of confidence. How you think the discretionary categories will perform? And to what extent, if at all, are you -- do you believe that there will be incremental buying activity due to lower gas prices?\n\n---\n\nYes. A really good question, and I'll break it into a couple different buckets here. This week, last year, was the first major snow event of the year in which we took a pretty sizable -- we had sizable difficulty managing the weather. This Saturday -- this coming Saturday, Sunday, Monday and Tuesday of next week. If you look at January, Paul, of last year -- and I think we called it out on the conference call for the fourth quarter, we came to work and had 1,000 stores shut down on several locations, right. And we dealt with a very, very, very weak January last year. January, historically, is one of our better months, better periods of the year. So I feel very comfortable in that there was -- and remember -- I'm getting a little ahead of myself here. I think, as I recall, there was a major snow event the week before Christmas last year, and unless you read the Farmers' Almanac, I'm very positive on the weather for the quarter. But I think that we've got that in our favor, and then I think the quality of our merchandise offering for Christmas is much better than it was last year, much better focused on affordability. This is, obviously, the big trimmer tree weekend. This is the first weekend where we see a lot of the Christmas trees being bought and all the decorations, and I'm still a little bit of a merchant. And we have reviewed all of our merchandising plans for December and January with the team, and we look pretty good.\n\n---\n\nI wanted to kind of step back and maybe just review -- I know we suspended the share repurchase. But maybe we can just remind everybody kind of how you look at your balance sheet, just generally, and share repurchase, notwithstanding, obviously, the activity but just kind of a review of how you guys think about things.\n\n---\n\nSure. Obviously, our #1 priority is investing in the business. We're a growth company. It's important to us to be opening up stores, so making sure that we have the capital to open new stores, to do remodels, to do relocations, and that we have the infrastructure in the back end of the business to support those stores, whether that be in the transportation and distribution area, in IT that we have system that will help make sure that we're supporting the stores. It's all about the stores, obviously. And then with the cash we have left over, our priority is share buyback and again, buying back as much stock as we can with what we have left after we've invested in the business. And because of the pending efforts on Family Dollar, we've suspended that share buyback on a temporary basis.\n\n---\n\nAnd a follow-up, as far as like your -- the levels of leverage you're comfortable with on the balance sheet, can you refresh us on that one as well, outside the M&A activity?\n\n---\n\nRight, yes, yes, exactly, and that's very, very important. We became investment grade a while back, and our thought process is that we want to stay investment grade. In order to do that, that debt-to-EBITDA needs to be somewhere in that 3.0, maybe a little bit higher than that, 3.1, somewhere in that range, overall, is where our targets are. Right now, we're at 3.1. We had a fairly sizable share buyback earlier in the year, $800 million, that's still with us, that's impacted that indice. That's why it's 3.1. We had been at 3.0 pretty solidly for many quarters on that.\n\n---\n\nAll right. That's perfect. And then I had another longer-term strategic question really revolving around the merchandising. I know you guys have got the DG market out there and still, I think, in test mode, but I wanted to, kind of longer term, think about how you're thinking about perishables in your business. A lot of our research shows that the lower end is starting to embrace a higher degree of wanting more fresh items and wanted to think -- is that something you think you can do by yourself? Will you need a partner? I mean, how are you thinking about fresh going forward?\n\n---\n\nYes. I think as I think about this, one of the areas that we've struggled with the most on the DG market side is the produce and the meat side, the fresh side. And when you grow up like I did, managing in a grocery store, managing in produce and meat, you realize that it's -- basically, you treat it like a living thing. And when you don't grow up with that, it's very hard to get people to understand the importance of rotation and the importance of display techniques. So it sounds easy to do, but it's much more difficult than that. I think long term, it's possible that a Dollar General might have some subset of fresh merchandise, right, maybe some oranges and some apples and bananas and potatoes, but long term, right now at least -- and by the way, you never say never. But right now, I would say us getting into any kind of significant position in that kind of perishable merchandise is probably not on our radar screen right now. Now frozen food, we love, and we've done a lot of great work on that. And by the way, we've done some good on easier to manage perishable items, like cheese and butter and orange juice and some items like that, lunch meat.\n\n---\n\nMy question was around gross margin. You cited some promotional activity. I'm just curious how much of the promotional activity is reactive versus more predatory from your perspective. And if gross margin opportunities exist, do you think you can get more predatory in particular areas?\n\n---\n\nYes, I mean, I'll answer that one. I would characterize it probably more reactionary than predatory. We are intently focused on everyday low price and -- but part of that is you have to be careful that there are some items out there where the consumer might judge your everyday low price based on what they see in the ad. So and again, I'll reiterate, the -- primarily, the promotional activity that we had in the quarter was all on CSD. So yes, and I would also say the more and more stable the promotional environment gets, it allows you to make investments in other areas of the business that you might want to, like the non-consumables side.\n\n---\n\nAnd my follow-up question was on home and apparel. It's -- I realize there's been a lot of mix change here and the price points you've talked about quite a bit. How much of the improvement in those businesses do you think is a function of the price points changing versus the quality of the product or the particular products that you're putting on the shelves?\n\n---\n\nYes, it's actually a combination of both. We're doing a much better job of color, a much better job of getting the product into the stores at the right time, a much better job of clearing out the old product prior to the new product getting in, and then I have to tell you we're promoting the product very similar to how a department store would.\n\n---\n\nA question about IMU. I'm wondering how many quarters in a row has it been -- the IMU, has been noticeably higher. And then does that coincide with the rise of the $1 items? Or is there something else that's helping drive that?\n\n---\n\nOffhand, I don't know how many quarters in a row it has been up, but I can tell you it's a combination of the $1 items and doing a better job of buying.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then as a follow-up, David, on the guidance for the fiscal year, I think you said that it does not -- it's not impacted by the cost of the potential that you're spending on the FDO pursuit, but in the third quarter, you included $8 million into SG&A. I just want to make sure I heard that right in understanding what you're saying on that.\n\n---\n\nThe -- so in the third quarter, we excluded the $8 million. We spelled it out, and we excluded it. As a matter of fact, if you go to the press release, there's a chart at the back that'll show you what's excluded from earnings per share, and that is excluded. And again, any cost that we'll have in the fourth quarter will be excluded also.\n\n---\n\nAll right. So that -- operator, that concludes our call today. Emma Jo and I will be around if anybody has any questions. I know we left a few people in the queue, but thank you very much for your time and attention, and we look forward to speaking to you soon.",

We had a very good Halloween and a good back-to-school, really pleased with that. I will tell you the bigger seasons have slowed down a bit, summer and spring, and of course, we experienced a little bit of slow traffic last year on Christmas. I will tell you we have an offering this year on the Christmas side that is much different than last year, and it's focused on affordability, many, many items below $5. And again, this idea that the $1 price point is incredibly important to our customer, a lot of items focused on $1, and we -- I don't see a structural change yet. We're looking for good things with seasonal in the fourth quarter, so we'll see how it plays out.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Lasser (Analysts)】\nObviously, a lot of focus on gas prices, but also, on the competitive environment. In the third quarter, we saw some improvement from some other discounters, at least a sequential improvement from the second to the third quarter. So my question is, what do you think the possibility is that as gas prices decline that you'll start to see some customers shift out of the discount convenience channel into other areas, especially after you've seen some massive customer migration into your channel over the last several years?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nYes, I think that the way I look at gas prices, number one, you're not going to see -- it takes a while for the consumer to really believe they've got extra change in their pocket. It's going to take a series of trips to the gas station to realize there's a little more money there. I think the other thing to take into account would be that it makes the customer more moldable. They obviously have the wherewithal to search for more deals across more channels, but at the end of the day, we're on our 27th year of same-store sales growth. We've had good times, we've had bad times, good economies, high gas prices, low gas prices. And our customer always seems to search us out. So I think the work we've done on affordability, I think we have hit that one out of the park. The unit growth that we are seeing is great, and again, I think as long as we stay focused on affordability, the customers can always be searching for us.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Lasser (Analysts)】\nThat's helpful. My follow question is, now that you have focused on affordability and building units, how do you build the basket or get them to trade back up after you've introduced the customer to all of these new products? Or is that not the focus?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nYes, I'd tell you the focus is on transactions and it's focused on units. I -- my personal feeling on this, Michael, is I never want to be in a position where I tell you my traffic is down and my basket is up, and I think that's when you start to get yourself into a bind. Our basket has been around $11 every year I've been here, and what we're seeing is that our customer's coming back more often to us.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scot Ciccarelli (Analysts)】\nObviously, you've had the lower gas prices. You've also seen a little bit of recovery in some of the labor metrics for, let's call it, non-college-educated consumers. Let's call it blue-collar kind of people. Rick, when you think about kind of all the gives and takes on the consumer side, I mean, how are you guys kind of thinking about it? And how do you think it rolls through 2015?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nYes, I think the middle-income, the low-income customer, I do think there's still -- I still think they've got some issues. I don't believe they have them to the magnitude they had them last year. I do feel better about the consumer, but I'm still a little more cautious. I'm cautiously optimistic, and I think it's interesting, when we -- you can almost go back last year and look at when the staff cuts hit and watch what happened. This year, you can see when we've lapped those staff cuts, you can see the change in consumer behavior. So again, I'm cautiously optimistic, and I think it will flow through to the retail sales line as we move through '15.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scot Ciccarelli (Analysts)】\nAnd when you consider kind of incremental changes for '15, I know it's becoming a bigger topic for a bunch of other retailers just in terms of some of the changes being implemented with health care, affordable care, et cetera. Have you guys thought about the potential impact that could potentially have on some of your consumer buying patterns?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nYes, and again, that's why we're so committed to the affordability piece. That's why we're working so hard getting items into the store that price $5 or less or even centered around the $1 price point. The whole idea here is, I believe, affordability is going to be with us for a period of time yet, and our customer -- yes, and our customer is just always looking for a bargain.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Wewer (Analysts)】\nYour focus on growing transactions, and market share makes a tremendous amount of sense. But the one problem is that Dollar General's GMROI has now dropped for 4 consecutive years and inventory is about 50% of your tangible assets. So the focus on growing share is coming at the expense of lower returns. Looking, let's say, to 2015 or 2016, are there any initiatives that could enable you to achieve both a better market share as well as a higher inventory productivity?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Tehle (Executives)】\nYes, a couple of comments on that. First of all, you have taken about -- take into account tobacco, when you look at the margin and we made a strategic decision to add tobacco, knowing what that would do overall. I think as we look forward, there are initiatives going on in foreign sourcing, in our private label as well as shrink. And as Rick mentioned in his comments, we saw some positives in shrink this quarter. So we still have the capability to add to that gross margin and that gross margin percent. Now having said that, again, I go back to what Rick said as he kicked this off, driving unit sales growth and then transaction growth will continue to be high priorities for us and what we're going to be focused on because we think ultimately, that's what our long-term shareholders want to see. But yes, there is room in margin and there are things where we continue to work on, but again, the unit growth and the transaction growth will always be at the top of the list.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Wewer (Analysts)】\nAnd David, just a follow-up. You had -- in your prepared comments, you noted that in the fourth quarter, you'll get a $0.04 contribution from tax credits. So I guess, tax rate is going to be, what, 35.5%, 36%. Did you have a similar tax credit in the fourth quarter of last year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Tehle (Executives)】\nSo what this is, is the WOTC, the Work Opportunity Tax Credit, and the way this works is these benefits expired December of last year, and we've been waiting all year for the federal government to take action on this. Last night, the House passed a bill of tax extenders by a vote of 378 to 46. That bill was now sent to the Senate, and the Senate is waiting for -- we're waiting for the Senate to take action on it. We, obviously, can't predict what the Senate will do, but if past history is any indication, more than likely, a 1-year extension will be provided. This is what we saw back in 2012 when this happened also, and then it'll be retroactively applied back. So we'll get the full year credit in the fourth quarter. As we've done our guidance for the full year, we always had this in our guidance. This isn't anything new. We felt like WOTC would come back, and we felt like it would probably be the fourth quarter simply because that's how it happened in the past. So again, it's been in there, and that's our thought process in terms of what hopefully will take place, but of course, we can't predict what the federal government will do.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Wewer (Analysts)】\nExactly. And you are saying, it was included in last year's fourth quarter earnings.\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Tehle (Executives)】\nIt was included all year, last year, yes. If you go back to 2012 -- the fourth quarter in 2012 because we had the situation where it got reinstated.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Wewer (Analysts)】\nOkay. I'll just switch -- just trying to get to an apples-to-apples number for the fourth quarter. So -- and so you are saying that it was worth $0.04 a year ago in the fourth quarter?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mary Winn Pilkington (Executives)】\nNo, no, Dan. It's Mary Winn. It was even. Because that had been adopted at the end of 2012, it was retroactive for 2012, and we took that all in the fourth quarter in 2012. And at that point in time, we provided the breakout of what that was on each quarter. And as it -- and then in 2013, it was effective all year in all 4 quarters.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Wewer (Analysts)】\nOkay. I think I understand, okay.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mary Winn Pilkington (Executives)】\nIt lasted beginning of 2014.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Wewer (Analysts)】\nThere you go. Got you.\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Tehle (Executives)】\nYes, it expired in December of 2013.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mary Winn Pilkington (Executives)】\nThat's right.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Meredith Adler (Analysts)】\nI was wondering if you could just go into a little bit more detail about how you use the data from your coupon program. I understand you see it as being similar to loyalty program but less expensive, but could you just walk us through kind of how it works, what you get and then what you do with the information?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nYes. I mean, it's very similar to a loyalty card. The advantage is we don't have to massage the data, the company that we're working with does. And what you do is you offer them a coupon to see if you can change their behavior. And the example would be, Meredith, if I offer you $1 off Charmin toilet tissue and you don't respond to that coupon, right, and so then what would happen is that would mean you're buying your tissue somewhere else, and I can turn around and make the offer more rich. And it allows me -- and what happens is, I have a slate of coupons and you walk into them. And again, the coupons you choose not to opt into would indicate you're probably buying your product somewhere else, and I can enrich those offers to drive your behavior.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Meredith Adler (Analysts)】\nAnd do you get to, in some way, keep track of each individual's purchases over time?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nAbsolutely. Remember, everybody enters their phone number, and it's how they register.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Meredith Adler (Analysts)】\nRight, got it. And then I just wanted to talk -- you were talking about your, I want to call them lifestyle remodels, but you know that's not what I mean -- life-cycle remodels and...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nYes, sure.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Meredith Adler (Analysts)】\nAnd you talked about, I think, 250 stores where you're actually going to be changing the offering and I think probably matching it to the local community better. Could you just talk about that initiative?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nYes, absolutely. So what we're going to do is we're going to take a store that's historically smaller that would go into a relocation bin, Meredith, and we're going to freshen these stores up and remodel them. And the idea here is they're going to have -- we will go into the store and analyze it and do category management. I'll use an example. This particular store in this particular market might sell more powdered detergent than liquid detergent, and what we will do is adjust the set to reflect more powder detergent, right. And there are markets, believe it or not, where powdered is still the biggest item. We have some markets where -- and I'll use the example of diapers. We have a diaper set that's exactly the same in every store across the chain, and now we'll be able to contract diapers and maybe expand on incontinence items in areas where we're closer to -- where the clientele's older. So we're really excited about this, and it's the heat-mapping concept that the guys have taken and spread out, where we can really understand what's selling and what's not on an individual store basis now.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Meredith Adler (Analysts)】\nAnd do you believe that, that drives sales or margin or both?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nActually, I'd say both because what we end up doing is having the items the customer wants, and hopefully, they'll buy more of them. And then consequently, it drives more transactions. And again, I equate that, Meredith, down to more units and more transactions. We're focused on units and transactions.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matt Nemer (Analysts)】\nSo I wanted to talk about promotional activity. It was very heavy early in Q2 and then it had moderated, but it sounds from your comments like it may have picked back up again in Q3 given the higher consumables markdowns and the end-of-season inventory clearance. If you could just give some color around the cadence of the promotional activity.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nYes, I think it is -- I would say it's certainly a little higher than quarter 2, but I would not call it irrational or nearly as competitive as last year. Again, our goal has always been to come to the market with the right items, and I would look at you and say it's primarily the promotional activity right now, Matt, around CSD. And again, I think I brought up in the second or first quarter that we were going to be in line on CSD pricing, and that's where you'll find the bulk of the incremental markdown for us.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matt Nemer (Analysts)】\nOkay, that's helpful. And then just a quick follow-up. Could you just talk to the interplay between the port issues and the driver shortages versus potential relief on freight from lower diesel prices?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nYes. I will tell you that we do have some merchandise that's hung up on the West Coast. We have worked very hard and absorbed incremental transportation cost to try and get in, move that product around. I also know that we found out yesterday, some of the shippers are refusing now to go into the West Coast docks and -- which is going to create more pressure. We estimate that between the dock shortage, the higher cost to get merchandise moved, that it's about 6 to 9 basis points, but we offset that, by the way, with vessel where we were able to get our stem miles down. I do think that it's going to be a problem as we move through the fourth quarter, and it'll be a problem for everybody. We are working hard on trying to divert product to the East Coast. There's been no indication that they're going to support their brothers on the West Coast. So we're going to have to stay tuned on that one.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matt Nemer (Analysts)】\nBut is there anything -- as you see kind of gas prices down and diesel prices down, is that big enough to potentially offset some of that? How quickly does that reset in your negotiations with the truckers?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nYes. I think the down diesel prices will help, but I don't know that it's going to help depending on the magnitude of what we encounter. I think you guys all know the West Coast -- the President had said he's not going to interfere with that. He's going to let it take its own course. So I think the gas price -- the lower diesel cost will help, but it's not going to cover it all.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Heinbockel (Analysts)】\nSo let me ask you, $5 items and under, where do you think that ultimately goes as a percent of sales, right? So how high do you think that goes in a reasonable period of time here? And then secondly, as part of that, if the number of items per basket are going up, ASP is going down, does that create some pressure, managing retail labor, right? Because you're trying to get throughput on more items with the same -- kind of the same basket size.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nYes, the first part of your question, we'll let the customer decide, right. When -- why we're adding more $1 and more items under $5? We are -- we still have a broad selection of product, right. So we're still very much in the game of letting the customer make the decision of what they want. And part of the way we have -- part of the way -- part of our success over the last year has been our ability to broaden our appeal, and some of that is not only the affordability angle but also having some more stuff in there. The second part of your question, we're working on getting case packs down, which will make it easier for the retail team to absorb the incremental items. I also think that having been on retail or having been on that side of the ledger, when sales are moving in the right direction, we've always somehow managed to conquer anything that's associated with it. And Greg and his team have done a marvelous job this year, so far, of working their way through that. We also, John, have, which we rolled out this year, a very serious stocking initiative, and we're doing a much better job not only in how we ship the product to the stores, but we're doing a much better job of measuring stocking productivity.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Heinbockel (Analysts)】\nAll right. And then just secondly, I know you don't -- you never quantify where you sit with shrink, but where do you think that opportunity sits relative to where it might have been when you first came in or relative to -- however you want to measure it? Is there still a fairly large opportunity there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nYes. It is certainly not at the level it was when I came in. It's better than that, but I see it as a significant improvement to come yet. In fact, even, John, where we were, we need to be better than where we were, if that helps.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Edward Kelly (Analysts)】\nI'd like to just ask you a question about the gross margin here. On a FIFO basis, you were actually almost flat, which is the first time and probably a couple years that we've seen that. And what I was looking to do is maybe get some additional color on the puts and takes here because the question is around affordability, for instance, and the work you're doing there. What impact on the gross margin does that have? You've mentioned no inflation in the business, but I think we have seen inflation, for instance, in consumables. So are you holding the line there? Is that having a negative impact? Right, and then how are you offsetting all of that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Tehle (Executives)】\nYes, so let me take a shot at some of these, and then certainly, Rick will comment, too. You have to remember, in our business, we're not as based on meat and produce and things of that nature where there has been a lot more impact of inflation. Now we have had a little bit of inflation in our candy and some of our other perishables, a little bit in tobacco. And particularly, as compared to last year, where it was actually going the other way, and that's why we have this LIFO negative that I spelled out earlier on the call. But I think, as you look at it, again, I go back to the 3 basic items that help us on gross margin in terms of offsetting negatives, and that is the foreign sourcing, the private label and the shrink. And we continue to push all 3 of those in terms of trying to drive a little bit more on the gross margin and the gross margin percentage.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Edward Kelly (Analysts)】\nThe work around affordability and particularly, you think about like the $1 price point, for instance, what impact does that have on margin? And then what impact does that have on gross profit dollars?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nYes. The margin on the affordability item is actually accretive. They tend to -- the $1 items tend to carry a little bit higher margin rate as do -- and the kind -- that margin rate will -- Ed, not as great when you get to the $5 items, but the lower-priced items, believe it or not, carry more. And it should help our rate.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Edward Kelly (Analysts)】\nOkay. So do you think you're at the point where we should begin to see stability in the gross margin going forward or maybe even opportunity now?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nI -- that is kind of where I'm at right now, to be honest with you. The work we've done on the margin -- we all have to remember we've got cigarettes in there, which is a 17 basis points drag albeit we've cycled that, but we anticipate we have margin expansion opportunities going forward now.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Trussell (Analysts)】\nJust to continue the conversation there on margins, just if you could hold our hand a little bit more on how you're thinking then about the fourth quarter, you mentioned in the prepared remarks that you were a little bit disappointed in gross margins -- or it's a little bit below, I should say, your initial expectations. Do you see sequential improvement ahead given some of the comments you just made around some of these initiatives on private label? And also, if you can just remind us, David, on how we should be thinking about the impact of the incentive comp swing within SG&A.\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Tehle (Executives)】\nYes. So I think as we look at the fourth quarter, right now, we're calling margins to be relatively flat, overall, in terms of basis points, and then we do have a significant delevering of SG&A. And you hit it right on. The biggest piece of that has to do with the incentive comp. If you go back to our script from fourth quarter last year, you'll see that we spelled out that incentive comp was a 45 basis point negative -- or excuse me, a 45 basis point positive last year to us because in essence, we had a fairly sizable reserve reversal in the fourth quarter since we did not pay any incentive comp. So that's the magnitude of what we're up against this fourth quarter.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Trussell (Analysts)】\nGot it. That's very helpful. And then just to go back and kind of clarify the fourth quarter comp outlook. It's certainly encouraging to hear that there has been an improvement in trends recently and that -- and we certainly acknowledge that you have an easier compare as we move through the quarter, but still, a 5% comp would be a pretty meaningful lift in acceleration on a 1-year basis. Maybe give us a little bit more color on what provides that level of confidence. How you think the discretionary categories will perform? And to what extent, if at all, are you -- do you believe that there will be incremental buying activity due to lower gas prices?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nYes. A really good question, and I'll break it into a couple different buckets here. This week, last year, was the first major snow event of the year in which we took a pretty sizable -- we had sizable difficulty managing the weather. This Saturday -- this coming Saturday, Sunday, Monday and Tuesday of next week. If you look at January, Paul, of last year -- and I think we called it out on the conference call for the fourth quarter, we came to work and had 1,000 stores shut down on several locations, right. And we dealt with a very, very, very weak January last year. January, historically, is one of our better months, better periods of the year. So I feel very comfortable in that there was -- and remember -- I'm getting a little ahead of myself here. I think, as I recall, there was a major snow event the week before Christmas last year, and unless you read the Farmers' Almanac, I'm very positive on the weather for the quarter. But I think that we've got that in our favor, and then I think the quality of our merchandise offering for Christmas is much better than it was last year, much better focused on affordability. This is, obviously, the big trimmer tree weekend. This is the first weekend where we see a lot of the Christmas trees being bought and all the decorations, and I'm still a little bit of a merchant. And we have reviewed all of our merchandising plans for December and January with the team, and we look pretty good.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Mushkin (Analysts)】\nI wanted to kind of step back and maybe just review -- I know we suspended the share repurchase. But maybe we can just remind everybody kind of how you look at your balance sheet, just generally, and share repurchase, notwithstanding, obviously, the activity but just kind of a review of how you guys think about things.\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Tehle (Executives)】\nSure. Obviously, our #1 priority is investing in the business. We're a growth company. It's important to us to be opening up stores, so making sure that we have the capital to open new stores, to do remodels, to do relocations, and that we have the infrastructure in the back end of the business to support those stores, whether that be in the transportation and distribution area, in IT that we have system that will help make sure that we're supporting the stores. It's all about the stores, obviously. And then with the cash we have left over, our priority is share buyback and again, buying back as much stock as we can with what we have left after we've invested in the business. And because of the pending efforts on Family Dollar, we've suspended that share buyback on a temporary basis.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Mushkin (Analysts)】\nAnd a follow-up, as far as like your -- the levels of leverage you're comfortable with on the balance sheet, can you refresh us on that one as well, outside the M&A activity?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Tehle (Executives)】\nRight, yes, yes, exactly, and that's very, very important. We became investment grade a while back, and our thought process is that we want to stay investment grade. In order to do that, that debt-to-EBITDA needs to be somewhere in that 3.0, maybe a little bit higher than that, 3.1, somewhere in that range, overall, is where our targets are. Right now, we're at 3.1. We had a fairly sizable share buyback earlier in the year, $800 million, that's still with us, that's impacted that indice. That's why it's 3.1. We had been at 3.0 pretty solidly for many quarters on that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Mushkin (Analysts)】\nAll right. That's perfect. And then I had another longer-term strategic question really revolving around the merchandising. I know you guys have got the DG market out there and still, I think, in test mode, but I wanted to, kind of longer term, think about how you're thinking about perishables in your business. A lot of our research shows that the lower end is starting to embrace a higher degree of wanting more fresh items and wanted to think -- is that something you think you can do by yourself? Will you need a partner? I mean, how are you thinking about fresh going forward?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nYes. I think as I think about this, one of the areas that we've struggled with the most on the DG market side is the produce and the meat side, the fresh side. And when you grow up like I did, managing in a grocery store, managing in produce and meat, you realize that it's -- basically, you treat it like a living thing. And when you don't grow up with that, it's very hard to get people to understand the importance of rotation and the importance of display techniques. So it sounds easy to do, but it's much more difficult than that. I think long term, it's possible that a Dollar General might have some subset of fresh merchandise, right, maybe some oranges and some apples and bananas and potatoes, but long term, right now at least -- and by the way, you never say never. But right now, I would say us getting into any kind of significant position in that kind of perishable merchandise is probably not on our radar screen right now. Now frozen food, we love, and we've done a lot of great work on that. And by the way, we've done some good on easier to manage perishable items, like cheese and butter and orange juice and some items like that, lunch meat.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Binder (Analysts)】\nMy question was around gross margin. You cited some promotional activity. I'm just curious how much of the promotional activity is reactive versus more predatory from your perspective. And if gross margin opportunities exist, do you think you can get more predatory in particular areas?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nYes, I mean, I'll answer that one. I would characterize it probably more reactionary than predatory. We are intently focused on everyday low price and -- but part of that is you have to be careful that there are some items out there where the consumer might judge your everyday low price based on what they see in the ad. So and again, I'll reiterate, the -- primarily, the promotional activity that we had in the quarter was all on CSD. So yes, and I would also say the more and more stable the promotional environment gets, it allows you to make investments in other areas of the business that you might want to, like the non-consumables side.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Binder (Analysts)】\nAnd my follow-up question was on home and apparel. It's -- I realize there's been a lot of mix change here and the price points you've talked about quite a bit. How much of the improvement in those businesses do you think is a function of the price points changing versus the quality of the product or the particular products that you're putting on the shelves?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nYes, it's actually a combination of both. We're doing a much better job of color, a much better job of getting the product into the stores at the right time, a much better job of clearing out the old product prior to the new product getting in, and then I have to tell you we're promoting the product very similar to how a department store would.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Montagna (Analysts)】\nA question about IMU. I'm wondering how many quarters in a row has it been -- the IMU, has been noticeably higher. And then does that coincide with the rise of the $1 items? Or is there something else that's helping drive that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nOffhand, I don't know how many quarters in a row it has been up, but I can tell you it's a combination of the $1 items and doing a better job of buying.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Montagna (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then as a follow-up, David, on the guidance for the fiscal year, I think you said that it does not -- it's not impacted by the cost of the potential that you're spending on the FDO pursuit, but in the third quarter, you included $8 million into SG&A. I just want to make sure I heard that right in understanding what you're saying on that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Tehle (Executives)】\nThe -- so in the third quarter, we excluded the $8 million. We spelled it out, and we excluded it. As a matter of fact, if you go to the press release, there's a chart at the back that'll show you what's excluded from earnings per share, and that is excluded. And again, any cost that we'll have in the fourth quarter will be excluded also.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mary Winn Pilkington (Executives)】\nAll right. So that -- operator, that concludes our call today. Emma Jo and I will be around if anybody has any questions. I know we left a few people in the queue, but thank you very much for your time and attention, and we look forward to speaking to you soon.",

      "transcript_text1": "Hello, and good morning. I'm delighted to be here and welcome you to the Sage 2014 results announcement. And you know that it's the first time that Steve Hare, our Chief Financial Officer, and I have combined to present results, so it's nice to see so many familiar faces in the audience, and it's good to be back. \r\nIn terms of myself, I think it's probably worth just opening and saying this for me, that Sage is my dream job. And that's not just sentimental. If you look at what I've done for 30 years, my professional care -- career, there's a couple of things I'm really excited about. One is SMEs, small to medium enterprises and entrepreneurs. This is the powerhouse of the U.K. and all developed economies, employing 60-plus percent of the folks out there across the U.K. And the folks who give up their lives and work night and day to build their businesses has always inspired me. Many of you know also that I'm an angel investor of multiple small to medium enterprises. I've been a director. Actually, I've led as a Chief Executive of small to medium enterprises. I've stood in their shoes, and I clearly understand what it takes to build businesses and grow businesses. \r\nThe other thing I did for the last 3 years was a duty -- I guess, a responsibility around public service. And for the last 3 years, I've been working with the British government and transformed the lives -- one of the things we did was transform the business relationship between government and small to medium enterprises with spectacular results, and that's really put a lot of small to medium enterprises in good shape in the U.K. and their dealings with the U.K. government. \r\nThe final thing I'd say around this is the small to medium enterprises is something that definitely inspires me. But when you add that to the second element, I've spent 30 years in the world of technology. So technology with -- is within my DNA. And many of you know me from either the NASDAQ technology that delivered great success or, more recently, the FTSE company where I was fortunate enough to be Chief Executive and again delivered some success there. \r\nSo when you combine these elements of passion about small to medium enterprises and the love for technology and seeing the future of technology and mapping that to customer needs, then I think I'm in an ideal place at Sage, and I feel very fortunate to be standing in front of you today, having the responsibility as Chief Executive of Sage. \r\nSo maybe in terms of today, what's appropriate is to just have some opening comments from myself and remarks after -- I think this is my 21st working day. So after 21 working days, it's fair to say you wouldn't expect conclusions, but I've certainly got some observations to share with you. And then have the meat of the presentation today with Steve Hare, our Chief Financial Officer, who will take us through and give us a great insight into 2014 results. \r\nSo let me start with some opening remarks, first of all, around the results themselves. I think they're a great set of results. And credit to Guy and the existing management team for delivering those results, with 5% organic growth and 27.5% operating margins, a very solid and good set of results. I think that gives us as a management team strong confidence to actually reaffirm management's guidance, supported by the board, for 2015 of 6% revenue growth and 28% operating margin. \r\nI think the other thing that you have to fundamentally read into the results and the reaffirmation and confidence of the management team is the strategy is paying off. So again, credit to Guy for the work done back in 2012 and the strategies put together again. And I think our view, and Steve's and my earlier views, is it's a lot about acceleration and execution of those strategies that will hold us in good, profitable growth territory going forward. So good results, reaffirmation of guidance, and the strategy is working. \r\nNow if I look at my reasons to want to be the Chief Executive of Sage, there's a couple of things that are probably worth sharing with you, and then in the last 21 days, these have been reinforced strongly. So first of all, Sage has got a global footprint. Secondly, I think it's got a very robust and strong business model. And the third aspect that was quite important to me is it's got a heritage of 30 years, and it's been proven over those 30 years to be there and ahead of the technology curve and disruption in the technology marketplace for its customers. I think those 3 things are pretty fundamental. \r\nWhat I wanted to do in my first 21 days is test those. And for me, the rubber always hits the road to go and see customers and our people. And connecting our people, delivering fantastic value for our customers, it resonates for me and any chief executive. So what I've done in 15 of those 21 days is actually get on a plane and go over 25,000 miles and visited pretty much all the locations in North America. And actually, some of you have followed me on Twitter, which is great on the road trip. And over that period of time, literally, of 3 weeks, I've been right through all the U.S. hubs, I've been down in Africa, and I've seen all the major European hubs. So I've got a pretty clear validation. It's not completely extensive, but within that, I met over 5,000 of our colleagues around the world and almost 100 customers and partners. \r\nAnd there's a couple of things, particularly from the customer sessions that I ran and customer forums, where I got a really strong insight, which I think is worthy of sharing with you today. During the customer sessions, there's a couple of things from the human point of view, the diversity of these businesses is fascinating. So I met people in the business of metalwork and electrical businesses, engineering companies, chemical companies, street cleaning companies, beauty products, soap products, such a diverse, enormous range of businesses we serve across the millions of customers and the SMEs out there. \r\nThe second thing is the human story. So there was 3 occasions where I met multigenerational Sage customers. So a mom and dad in a bakery business have actually set up their 2 children, daughter and son, in a video-editing media business. And we have a Sage 50 customer in the bakery business and a Sage One customer in the cloud for the younger generation. So I think, again, testimony to being there but also getting ahead and actually supporting the entrepreneurs of tomorrow grow and be successful in their businesses. \r\nThe other thing -- there's probably 3 things that kind of really resonated strongly as I sat in these customer sessions, probably 1/2 dozen, a dozen customers around the table with myself talking about their businesses and what they see in terms of their business challenges. On my iPad, I made a note. There's a number of times, probably at least 1/2 dozen times, when the customers just said 2 words: great product; Sage, great product. I made a kind of note of that. Second thing, a number of the customers said, \"It's indispensable, indispensable, indispensable. We see you not only here today but absolutely our strategic partner to take us into the world where there is technology disruption and mobility and all those exciting things around social communities and the cloud.\" So great product, indispensable were really resonating. \r\nThe third thing I think is really important to be recognized, particularly in our European businesses, is the value and the strength of the local support, being able to pick up the phone or go on the web and deal with someone who understands that compliance regime, that regulatory regime, that detailed, fundamental element that is relevant to, say, the German accounting marketplace. And it just came back stronger and stronger around the quality of the support that Sage provides its customers and the value derived from that and that they're local and available. \r\nSo they were the kind of 3 things that the customers came back, which leads me on to the colleagues. I met over 5,000 colleagues, and it's really important to just share a couple of thoughts with you. So I said most of -- what I would really focus on is around the core execution, and you know people like Steve and I are very operational and very focused on execution. And how that played out with our people when I did these all-hands town hall meetings was definitely people in Sage are up for increasing pace, increasing pace of execution. And that's a message I'm resonating around the world within Sage: increasing pace. The other thing that's fundamental is, where it's appropriate, one Sage. And again, our people are really up for combining. And we've seen with some of the success in terms of the numbers of Sage One, with 150% growth in paid subscription, the value of global products and, ultimately, global initiatives that make sense, and then it delivered through this really strong network of local businesses close to the customer. So one Sage and increasing pace for our people are fundamental elements. \r\nNow in terms of our thoughts, today is really all about 2014 results and, obviously, reaffirmation of management's guidance around 2015. What we're doing over the next few months, and just to kind of make you aware, I think it's probably too early, and you wouldn't expect me to say I've got all the answers. I've got lots of thoughts, lots of questions, and I validated the core principles that this is a robust business, and it's a business built for growth. But over the next few months, we'll be doing more work and business model and then things you'd expect us to do to be able to come to you after the IMS and after interims in the summer of 2015. And we are at that point in time planning a Capital Markets Day to share with you the strategy and the opportunities we face in Sage. So just to kind of mark your calendars ahead, that's probably the right and appropriate time to think about really lifting our eyes and looking forward on the opportunities for the future. \r\nSo at that point, I'd like to introduce Steve Hare, who will take us through the 2014 numbers, and then I'll come back, and we'll open up for questions and answers. Thanks, Steve.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Stephen, and good morning, everyone. It's great to be here to present the first full set of results. Obviously, I was here at the interims, but to be here to present the first full set is great. And it's, obviously, also encouraging that it's such a good set of results. And I think these results really show that Sage has got some momentum and momentum in a number of areas: momentum in the cloud; momentum in subscription; and most critically, momentum towards achieving the financial targets which we've set for ourselves. \r\nSo I'm going to cover first the financial highlights. So 5% organic growth, as Stephen has already said, is a key milestone on the route to 6% in 2015. I do expect in 2015 that more of that growth will come in the second half than in the first half, so I think the first half revenue growth is more likely to be at the lower end of the range. Recurring revenue growth of 7%, I think, is very significant. This highlights both the quality of the growth but also the momentum, and the fact that recurring revenue is now 73% of total revenue is also important. Also underpinning that growth was the move to subscription, which I'll come back to. Organic operating margin of 27.5% demonstrates our continued discipline with respect to profitable growth and cost management. And also the underlying EPS growth of 8% reflects that profitable growth but also a slightly lower tax rate and also the impact of the share buyback program. We've also accompanied this with an increase in the dividend of 7%. I should mention that as a result of the review of goodwill, we do have an impairment charge of GBP 44 million with respect to Brazil. This is largely due to the fact that there are now tougher economic conditions than -- compared to the time at which we did the acquisition. At the time we did the acquisition, GDP growth was 8% to 9%. It's now closer to 1%. The business, however, did achieve 9% organic growth in FY '14, and we remain optimistic about the prospects for the business. So this is more of a noncash accounting adjustment than a reflection of any change in the view of the business prospects. So overall financially, a good set of numbers, which also supports our financial targets for FY '15. \r\nSo on to the nonfinancial KPIs. We've seen a 29% increase in the annualized value of the software subscriber base, increasing the rate of growth, which we reported at the interims, when it was 24%. We are growing our subscription base, and this will continue to be a feature as we continue to attract new customers, mainly through Sage One; reactivate existing customers, particularly through core product modernization; and also migrate from existing maintenance and support contracts to subscription. It was an important, even pivotal year for cloud adoption, with an increase of 150% in the number of Sage One paying subscriptions to 86,000. This was led by the U.K. and Ireland. And also South Africa are achieving -- is achieving a very strong performance. The progress in North America was below where we want to be, but we're addressing this, but it will take time. \r\nHybrid cloud is also starting to get some traction, with 1,500 subscriptions, but this is more of a future enabler of growth. Sage ERP X3 growth of 7% was below our double-digit ambitions, and this reflects the weakness that we have in France, which we highlighted at the interims, mainly in the direct channel. Outside of France, the growth in Sage ERP X3 was 20%. Integrated payments growth of 14% was okay, but I do think this is a very significant opportunity as the penetration of the installed base for integrated payments remains low. \r\nIf you turn now to revenue growth, this slide gives you an update of the sources of growth similar to that which we presented at the interims. The theme is very similar, with software subscription being the primary growth driver. As I said at the interims, this is increasingly significant. We're finding that customers like subscription, particularly small business. It gives predictability of cash flow and access to all the latest features. It also gives Sage a more predictable revenue stream with lower levels of customer attrition, and we continue to manage this transition whilst still delivering on organic growth, margin and free cash flow targets.  The operating margin is progressing as we forecast and is on track for the 28% FY '15 target. \r\nSo I'm going to turn now and just talk a little bit about the regions, starting with Europe. We saw a good increase in growth to 4% from 2% last time, but the real highlight that I would like to pull out is recurring revenue of 7%. Just a pause on that, that means that Europe is in line with the group in terms of recurring revenue growth. It's not dilutive to the group. And that recurring revenue growth has been driven principally by the move to subscription in both France and the U.K. and Ireland. As I also commented on at the interims, Southern Europe is now stabilized, with both Spain and Portugal showing some growth. Mid-market was highlighted at the interims as being an area of some weakness. Actions are being taken to address this, including some leadership changes. And although I remain cautious for the first half, I think there are some significant opportunities in mid-market Europe. \r\nLooking forward to FY '15, we can see the trajectory, therefore, in Europe is supporting our overall 6% growth target. The operating margin nudged up slightly to 28.6%, which was in line with our expectations. \r\nTurning to the Americas. We saw overall growth in the Americas of 5%, with North America up 4% and Brazil up 9%. Recurring revenue was up at 8% -- at 6% as the premium contract upsell initiative that we've been running in North America continued, and we also saw further subscription growth in Brazil. The North American growth rate of 4% was weaker than last year due mainly to softness in payments, particularly in the second half. The situation is now stabilized in the payments business, and we expect to see the payments business return to growth, but I would be cautious about how much we see in the first half. Sage ERP X3 grew strongly from a low base in North America. And Brazil was also good at 9%, given the economic environment in Brazil. The acquisition of PayChoice was completed after the year-end, and we're focused on the integration of this business, which is progressing in line with plan. And the operating margin was in line with our expectations at 25.7%. \r\nTurning now to AAMEA, where we saw 12% organic growth. This was led by South Africa, which achieved 16%, and this in a country experiencing pretty difficult economic conditions. So I think this was an excellent performance and was underpinned by strength in the mid-market. Australia was solid at 6%. And in AAMEA, we saw a decline in the operating margin due to some additional investments and a greater level of lower-margin professional services. \r\nSo we continue to focus on moving our resources towards Invest products. This remains a very important ingredient of how we're funding the transition of the business. Stephen and I see this as an area of continued focus to ensure that we are allocating resources to the areas that give greatest benefit to both Sage and also to its customers. \r\nSo cash flow. Very important that we don't lose sight of how important free cash flow is. We want to grow this business and continue to grow this business, but we also want to generate free cash flow. For this year, I've retained the conversion methodology that's been used in the past to give consistency, which gives a conversion rate of 107%, slightly lower than the half year due to some working capital timing. However, going forward, I'm going to change the calculation in order that we use underlying cash from operations after capital expenditure, after operating capital expenditure. So on this basis, the cash conversion would've been 99%. The reason for doing this is that I think it gives a better measure in terms of tracking operational performance, but also gives greater consistency in terms of how we measure cash conversion internally. Leverage at the year-end was 1.1x. Pro forma after the PayChoice acquisition, it would've been 1.3x. Free cash flow of GBP 229 million or around 18% of revenue remains a strong number. In terms of how we use that free cash flow, we completed our acquisition in Germany. We settled the puts and call option on the remaining 25% of our business in Brazil, with the PayChoice acquisition completing post the year-end. We also continued the share buyback program and implemented our progressive dividend policy. \r\nSo now I'd like to talk about some of the things which support the future. I'm going to talk first about the momentum that we have with subscription and also how the cloud and the growth opportunities we have across our portfolio underpins our confidence in 2015 and beyond. \r\nFirstly, the move to high-quality subscription revenue continues. As I mentioned, recurring revenue is now 73% of total revenue. This is up from 71% 12 months ago. And likewise, software subscription is up from 13% to 16% of the total. Over time, you'll also see a switch within these numbers as we move more subscription -- more maintenance and support customers to subscription, so I expect that, that 16% will continue to increase. \r\nSo how is Sage going about encouraging customers to move to subscription? The cloud is very important to Sage and to its customers, and it enables everything that we're doing, particularly in driving subscription. Our cloud solutions, core product modernization initiatives and a growing portfolio of connected services are providing subscription catalysts to our customers. Our philosophy, which we stated a number of times before, is that we offer customers choice. We therefore incentivize our customers to move, whether it be to migrate to new products or whether it be to migrate to subscription. And core product modernization is a great example of how this incentive works for the installed base. This enables existing customers to access new services. And we have millions of small and medium-sized businesses that use our products and services, and these modernized core products are now helping to drive adoption of subscription as we sell licenses via subscription, rather than license upgrades. I'm going to give some examples in a minute. But what this does is allow our existing customers to have all the benefits of maintaining their on-premise environment, but with the additional benefit of cloud connectivity and mobility. \r\nSo when you think about subscription for Sage within the installed base, rather than with the new customers, don't just think about it as new license revenue displacement. Think about 3 areas where our installed base gives us opportunities: firstly, reactivating existing customers, this drives higher attachment rates, particularly with small business; migrating existing customers to higher value offerings, this drives higher average revenue per user and customer stickiness through migrating existing maintenance and support customers to premium solutions with value-added features; and cross sell, cross sell to existing customers, driving a higher share of wallet from those customers. All of these are new sources of revenue which contribute to growth, and the cloud provides the building blocks to enable it. \r\nWhat I'd like to do is illustrate with 3 examples, all of which have contributed to revenue growth in FY '14. The first is Sage Ciel Flex in France. This is a reactivation story. This is small businesses being attracted to the top tier of subscription with offers which allow mobile cloud capability, all-new revenue and no displacement of existing revenue. \r\nThe second example is Sage 100 i7. This is a migration of existing on-plan customers, so on-plan customers who already have a maintenance and support contract, but migrating them to a premium product which is only available on subscription. As a premium product, customers are attracted to the added value over what they're currently buying. And this is the catalyst for them to switch from a standard maintenance and support contract to a subscription contract. In this particular case, for this migration, we also charge an upfront activation fee, which therefore offsets anything we would have had as an upgrade license fee. \r\nAnd the third example is auto-enrollment in the U.K. Pension auto-enrollment is a headache for small businesses. And the U.K. have introduced the connected service which allows our customers to deal with this. Previously, this feature is something we would have probably bundled into an existing payroll product, but we decided to offer it as a feature on subscription. So that's had a very high take-up. I think something like 60% of our existing Sage 50 Payroll customers have taken this feature, and it's all additional revenue. \r\nSo adding value to existing customers is very important, but so is acquiring new ones. We acquired new customers in a number of areas, but there's 2 key areas where I'd like to talk about it: one is small customers, principally through Sage One; and the other is mid-market ERP through Sage ERP X3. \r\nFor small customers, in the U.K. alone, it is estimated that over 1.5 million small businesses still use spreadsheets. This is a significant amount of whitespace, and these potential new customers are clearly attracted to the cloud. It offers ease-of-use and no upfront costs. For the less -- for less than the cost of your monthly mobile phone bill, you can start to enjoy the convenience of using Sage One. \r\nIn mid-market, with Sage ERP X3 version 7, we have a very attractive product, which is using all the benefits of the cloud to give a compelling offer to customers. Adoption and pace of change in mid-market is slower than small businesses, but it's important to be able to offer connected solutions in this segment. \r\nAs I said earlier, it was a pivotal year for Sage One. This offering is now available in 10 markets, with the number of subscriptions increasing by 150% to 86,000. As part of our global focus, we redesigned some of the SaaS offerings to make them part of the Sage One family. If you just -- if you exclude these redesigned offerings, the Sage One base would have been 53,000. So I'm just giving you the numbers so you can relate them back to what we've disclosed previously. And of those 53,000, 47,000 was in the U.K. and Ireland. We've been very pleased to see the strong momentum in both U.K. and Ireland, but also in South Africa. \r\nIf you look at this graph, which is for U.K. and Ireland, you can see that we were somewhat late to market with our Sage One product. However, now that we're in the market with both accounting and payroll products, if you look at the adoption rate over the last couple of years, you can start to see how we're catching up. \r\nAs I said, North America is behind our ambitions. But again, compared to the U.K., we were a bit later to market in terms of introducing Sage One into the U.S. And Sage One Extra, which is the product with deeper functionality, which is available in the U.K., is only just about to be introduced in the U.S. So if you look at this graph, compare it to the U.S. in terms of rate of adoption and when we went into the market, that helps explain why we have a bit more work to do in the U.S. in order to get to where we need to be. And also secondly, we have some work to do around the channel, particularly the accountants channel, which is less well developed than it is in the U.K. \r\nSo cloud is making a big difference to Sage, and we're using it to improve customer experience for all our customers, both existing and new customers. Sage is here to serve customers of all generations, from young people starting up for the first time through to customers who've been with us for 30 years plus. \r\nThis slide uses subscription as an example to show the progress and the momentum that Sage has and how we continue to offer customers choice. We aim to have customers for life, and so the move to subscription will be progressive, with greatest pace taking place with smaller customers. We're pleased with the progress we're making. We've built a strong platform for future growth but in a way that our customers appreciate and value. \r\nSo to conclude. We exit the year with momentum in the cloud, with momentum in subscription and with momentum in revenue growth, particularly evidenced by the 7% recurring revenue growth. We reaffirm our guidance of achieving 6% organic revenue growth and 28% operating margin in FY '15, and we will achieve these targets with momentum and underpinned by strong free cash flow. \r\nStephen and I are already developing a good partnership, and we're looking forward to seeing you at the Capital Markets Day and presenting more around how we see increasing the pace of execution in Sage, and we look forward to seeing you then. Thank you.\n\n---\n\nThanks very much, Steve. What we'll do now is open it up to your questions. For also a couple of things, we got questions on the conference call line as well, so I might interject those. But it'd be really helpful if you could just say your name and the institution you represent as well when you kick off. Do you want to go on and go first? You got a mic, a roving mic as well, I should have said that, sorry.",

And many of you know me from either the NASDAQ technology that delivered great success or, more recently, the FTSE company where I was fortunate enough to be Chief Executive and again delivered some success there. \r\nSo when you combine these elements of passion about small to medium enterprises and the love for technology and seeing the future of technology and mapping that to customer needs, then I think I'm in an ideal place at Sage, and I feel very fortunate to be standing in front of you today, having the responsibility as Chief Executive of Sage. \r\nSo maybe in terms of today, what's appropriate is to just have some opening comments from myself and remarks after -- I think this is my 21st working day. So after 21 working days, it's fair to say you wouldn't expect conclusions, but I've certainly got some observations to share with you. And then have the meat of the presentation today with Steve Hare, our Chief Financial Officer, who will take us through and give us a great insight into 2014 results. \r\nSo let me start with some opening remarks, first of all, around the results themselves. I think they're a great set of results. And credit to Guy and the existing management team for delivering those results, with 5% organic growth and 27.5% operating margins, a very solid and good set of results. I think that gives us as a management team strong confidence to actually reaffirm management's guidance, supported by the board, for 2015 of 6% revenue growth and 28% operating margin. \r\nI think the other thing that you have to fundamentally read into the results and the reaffirmation and confidence of the management team is the strategy is paying off. So again, credit to Guy for the work done back in 2012 and the strategies put together again. And I think our view, and Steve's and my earlier views, is it's a lot about acceleration and execution of those strategies that will hold us in good, profitable growth territory going forward. So good results, reaffirmation of guidance, and the strategy is working. \r\nNow if I look at my reasons to want to be the Chief Executive of Sage, there's a couple of things that are probably worth sharing with you, and then in the last 21 days, these have been reinforced strongly. So first of all, Sage has got a global footprint. Secondly, I think it's got a very robust and strong business model. And the third aspect that was quite important to me is it's got a heritage of 30 years, and it's been proven over those 30 years to be there and ahead of the technology curve and disruption in the technology marketplace for its customers. I think those 3 things are pretty fundamental. \r\nWhat I wanted to do in my first 21 days is test those. And for me, the rubber always hits the road to go and see customers and our people. And connecting our people, delivering fantastic value for our customers, it resonates for me and any chief executive. So what I've done in 15 of those 21 days is actually get on a plane and go over 25,000 miles and visited pretty much all the locations in North America. And actually, some of you have followed me on Twitter, which is great on the road trip. And over that period of time, literally, of 3 weeks, I've been right through all the U.S. hubs, I've been down in Africa, and I've seen all the major European hubs. So I've got a pretty clear validation. It's not completely extensive, but within that, I met over 5,000 of our colleagues around the world and almost 100 customers and partners. \r\nAnd there's a couple of things, particularly from the customer sessions that I ran and customer forums, where I got a really strong insight, which I think is worthy of sharing with you today. During the customer sessions, there's a couple of things from the human point of view, the diversity of these businesses is fascinating. So I met people in the business of metalwork and electrical businesses, engineering companies, chemical companies, street cleaning companies, beauty products, soap products, such a diverse, enormous range of businesses we serve across the millions of customers and the SMEs out there. \r\nThe second thing is the human story. So there was 3 occasions where I met multigenerational Sage customers. So a mom and dad in a bakery business have actually set up their 2 children, daughter and son, in a video-editing media business. And we have a Sage 50 customer in the bakery business and a Sage One customer in the cloud for the younger generation. So I think, again, testimony to being there but also getting ahead and actually supporting the entrepreneurs of tomorrow grow and be successful in their businesses. \r\nThe other thing -- there's probably 3 things that kind of really resonated strongly as I sat in these customer sessions, probably 1/2 dozen, a dozen customers around the table with myself talking about their businesses and what they see in terms of their business challenges. On my iPad, I made a note. There's a number of times, probably at least 1/2 dozen times, when the customers just said 2 words: great product; Sage, great product. I made a kind of note of that. Second thing, a number of the customers said, \"It's indispensable, indispensable, indispensable. We see you not only here today but absolutely our strategic partner to take us into the world where there is technology disruption and mobility and all those exciting things around social communities and the cloud.\" So great product, indispensable were really resonating. \r\nThe third thing I think is really important to be recognized, particularly in our European businesses, is the value and the strength of the local support, being able to pick up the phone or go on the web and deal with someone who understands that compliance regime, that regulatory regime, that detailed, fundamental element that is relevant to, say, the German accounting marketplace. And it just came back stronger and stronger around the quality of the support that Sage provides its customers and the value derived from that and that they're local and available. \r\nSo they were the kind of 3 things that the customers came back, which leads me on to the colleagues. I met over 5,000 colleagues, and it's really important to just share a couple of thoughts with you. So I said most of -- what I would really focus on is around the core execution, and you know people like Steve and I are very operational and very focused on execution. And how that played out with our people when I did these all-hands town hall meetings was definitely people in Sage are up for increasing pace, increasing pace of execution. And that's a message I'm resonating around the world within Sage: increasing pace. The other thing that's fundamental is, where it's appropriate, one Sage. And again, our people are really up for combining. And we've seen with some of the success in terms of the numbers of Sage One, with 150% growth in paid subscription, the value of global products and, ultimately, global initiatives that make sense, and then it delivered through this really strong network of local businesses close to the customer. So one Sage and increasing pace for our people are fundamental elements. \r\nNow in terms of our thoughts, today is really all about 2014 results and, obviously, reaffirmation of management's guidance around 2015. What we're doing over the next few months, and just to kind of make you aware, I think it's probably too early, and you wouldn't expect me to say I've got all the answers. I've got lots of thoughts, lots of questions, and I validated the core principles that this is a robust business, and it's a business built for growth. But over the next few months, we'll be doing more work and business model and then things you'd expect us to do to be able to come to you after the IMS and after interims in the summer of 2015. And we are at that point in time planning a Capital Markets Day to share with you the strategy and the opportunities we face in Sage. So just to kind of mark your calendars ahead, that's probably the right and appropriate time to think about really lifting our eyes and looking forward on the opportunities for the future. \r\nSo at that point, I'd like to introduce Steve Hare, who will take us through the 2014 numbers, and then I'll come back, and we'll open up for questions and answers. Thanks, Steve.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Stephen Hare (Executives)】\nThanks, Stephen, and good morning, everyone. It's great to be here to present the first full set of results. Obviously, I was here at the interims, but to be here to present the first full set is great. And it's, obviously, also encouraging that it's such a good set of results. And I think these results really show that Sage has got some momentum and momentum in a number of areas: momentum in the cloud; momentum in subscription; and most critically, momentum towards achieving the financial targets which we've set for ourselves. \r\nSo I'm going to cover first the financial highlights. So 5% organic growth, as Stephen has already said, is a key milestone on the route to 6% in 2015. I do expect in 2015 that more of that growth will come in the second half than in the first half, so I think the first half revenue growth is more likely to be at the lower end of the range. Recurring revenue growth of 7%, I think, is very significant. This highlights both the quality of the growth but also the momentum, and the fact that recurring revenue is now 73% of total revenue is also important. Also underpinning that growth was the move to subscription, which I'll come back to. Organic operating margin of 27.5% demonstrates our continued discipline with respect to profitable growth and cost management. And also the underlying EPS growth of 8% reflects that profitable growth but also a slightly lower tax rate and also the impact of the share buyback program. We've also accompanied this with an increase in the dividend of 7%. I should mention that as a result of the review of goodwill, we do have an impairment charge of GBP 44 million with respect to Brazil. This is largely due to the fact that there are now tougher economic conditions than -- compared to the time at which we did the acquisition. At the time we did the acquisition, GDP growth was 8% to 9%. It's now closer to 1%. The business, however, did achieve 9% organic growth in FY '14, and we remain optimistic about the prospects for the business. So this is more of a noncash accounting adjustment than a reflection of any change in the view of the business prospects. So overall financially, a good set of numbers, which also supports our financial targets for FY '15. \r\nSo on to the nonfinancial KPIs. We've seen a 29% increase in the annualized value of the software subscriber base, increasing the rate of growth, which we reported at the interims, when it was 24%. We are growing our subscription base, and this will continue to be a feature as we continue to attract new customers, mainly through Sage One; reactivate existing customers, particularly through core product modernization; and also migrate from existing maintenance and support contracts to subscription. It was an important, even pivotal year for cloud adoption, with an increase of 150% in the number of Sage One paying subscriptions to 86,000. This was led by the U.K. and Ireland. And also South Africa are achieving -- is achieving a very strong performance. The progress in North America was below where we want to be, but we're addressing this, but it will take time. \r\nHybrid cloud is also starting to get some traction, with 1,500 subscriptions, but this is more of a future enabler of growth. Sage ERP X3 growth of 7% was below our double-digit ambitions, and this reflects the weakness that we have in France, which we highlighted at the interims, mainly in the direct channel. Outside of France, the growth in Sage ERP X3 was 20%. Integrated payments growth of 14% was okay, but I do think this is a very significant opportunity as the penetration of the installed base for integrated payments remains low. \r\nIf you turn now to revenue growth, this slide gives you an update of the sources of growth similar to that which we presented at the interims. The theme is very similar, with software subscription being the primary growth driver. As I said at the interims, this is increasingly significant. We're finding that customers like subscription, particularly small business. It gives predictability of cash flow and access to all the latest features. It also gives Sage a more predictable revenue stream with lower levels of customer attrition, and we continue to manage this transition whilst still delivering on organic growth, margin and free cash flow targets.  The operating margin is progressing as we forecast and is on track for the 28% FY '15 target. \r\nSo I'm going to turn now and just talk a little bit about the regions, starting with Europe. We saw a good increase in growth to 4% from 2% last time, but the real highlight that I would like to pull out is recurring revenue of 7%. Just a pause on that, that means that Europe is in line with the group in terms of recurring revenue growth. It's not dilutive to the group. And that recurring revenue growth has been driven principally by the move to subscription in both France and the U.K. and Ireland. As I also commented on at the interims, Southern Europe is now stabilized, with both Spain and Portugal showing some growth. Mid-market was highlighted at the interims as being an area of some weakness. Actions are being taken to address this, including some leadership changes. And although I remain cautious for the first half, I think there are some significant opportunities in mid-market Europe. \r\nLooking forward to FY '15, we can see the trajectory, therefore, in Europe is supporting our overall 6% growth target. The operating margin nudged up slightly to 28.6%, which was in line with our expectations. \r\nTurning to the Americas. We saw overall growth in the Americas of 5%, with North America up 4% and Brazil up 9%. Recurring revenue was up at 8% -- at 6% as the premium contract upsell initiative that we've been running in North America continued, and we also saw further subscription growth in Brazil. The North American growth rate of 4% was weaker than last year due mainly to softness in payments, particularly in the second half. The situation is now stabilized in the payments business, and we expect to see the payments business return to growth, but I would be cautious about how much we see in the first half. Sage ERP X3 grew strongly from a low base in North America. And Brazil was also good at 9%, given the economic environment in Brazil. The acquisition of PayChoice was completed after the year-end, and we're focused on the integration of this business, which is progressing in line with plan. And the operating margin was in line with our expectations at 25.7%. \r\nTurning now to AAMEA, where we saw 12% organic growth. This was led by South Africa, which achieved 16%, and this in a country experiencing pretty difficult economic conditions. So I think this was an excellent performance and was underpinned by strength in the mid-market. Australia was solid at 6%. And in AAMEA, we saw a decline in the operating margin due to some additional investments and a greater level of lower-margin professional services. \r\nSo we continue to focus on moving our resources towards Invest products. This remains a very important ingredient of how we're funding the transition of the business. Stephen and I see this as an area of continued focus to ensure that we are allocating resources to the areas that give greatest benefit to both Sage and also to its customers. \r\nSo cash flow. Very important that we don't lose sight of how important free cash flow is. We want to grow this business and continue to grow this business, but we also want to generate free cash flow. For this year, I've retained the conversion methodology that's been used in the past to give consistency, which gives a conversion rate of 107%, slightly lower than the half year due to some working capital timing. However, going forward, I'm going to change the calculation in order that we use underlying cash from operations after capital expenditure, after operating capital expenditure. So on this basis, the cash conversion would've been 99%. The reason for doing this is that I think it gives a better measure in terms of tracking operational performance, but also gives greater consistency in terms of how we measure cash conversion internally. Leverage at the year-end was 1.1x. Pro forma after the PayChoice acquisition, it would've been 1.3x. Free cash flow of GBP 229 million or around 18% of revenue remains a strong number. In terms of how we use that free cash flow, we completed our acquisition in Germany. We settled the puts and call option on the remaining 25% of our business in Brazil, with the PayChoice acquisition completing post the year-end. We also continued the share buyback program and implemented our progressive dividend policy. \r\nSo now I'd like to talk about some of the things which support the future. I'm going to talk first about the momentum that we have with subscription and also how the cloud and the growth opportunities we have across our portfolio underpins our confidence in 2015 and beyond. \r\nFirstly, the move to high-quality subscription revenue continues. As I mentioned, recurring revenue is now 73% of total revenue. This is up from 71% 12 months ago. And likewise, software subscription is up from 13% to 16% of the total. Over time, you'll also see a switch within these numbers as we move more subscription -- more maintenance and support customers to subscription, so I expect that, that 16% will continue to increase. \r\nSo how is Sage going about encouraging customers to move to subscription? The cloud is very important to Sage and to its customers, and it enables everything that we're doing, particularly in driving subscription. Our cloud solutions, core product modernization initiatives and a growing portfolio of connected services are providing subscription catalysts to our customers. Our philosophy, which we stated a number of times before, is that we offer customers choice. We therefore incentivize our customers to move, whether it be to migrate to new products or whether it be to migrate to subscription. And core product modernization is a great example of how this incentive works for the installed base. This enables existing customers to access new services. And we have millions of small and medium-sized businesses that use our products and services, and these modernized core products are now helping to drive adoption of subscription as we sell licenses via subscription, rather than license upgrades. I'm going to give some examples in a minute. But what this does is allow our existing customers to have all the benefits of maintaining their on-premise environment, but with the additional benefit of cloud connectivity and mobility. \r\nSo when you think about subscription for Sage within the installed base, rather than with the new customers, don't just think about it as new license revenue displacement. Think about 3 areas where our installed base gives us opportunities: firstly, reactivating existing customers, this drives higher attachment rates, particularly with small business; migrating existing customers to higher value offerings, this drives higher average revenue per user and customer stickiness through migrating existing maintenance and support customers to premium solutions with value-added features; and cross sell, cross sell to existing customers, driving a higher share of wallet from those customers. All of these are new sources of revenue which contribute to growth, and the cloud provides the building blocks to enable it. \r\nWhat I'd like to do is illustrate with 3 examples, all of which have contributed to revenue growth in FY '14. The first is Sage Ciel Flex in France. This is a reactivation story. This is small businesses being attracted to the top tier of subscription with offers which allow mobile cloud capability, all-new revenue and no displacement of existing revenue. \r\nThe second example is Sage 100 i7. This is a migration of existing on-plan customers, so on-plan customers who already have a maintenance and support contract, but migrating them to a premium product which is only available on subscription. As a premium product, customers are attracted to the added value over what they're currently buying. And this is the catalyst for them to switch from a standard maintenance and support contract to a subscription contract. In this particular case, for this migration, we also charge an upfront activation fee, which therefore offsets anything we would have had as an upgrade license fee. \r\nAnd the third example is auto-enrollment in the U.K. Pension auto-enrollment is a headache for small businesses. And the U.K. have introduced the connected service which allows our customers to deal with this. Previously, this feature is something we would have probably bundled into an existing payroll product, but we decided to offer it as a feature on subscription. So that's had a very high take-up. I think something like 60% of our existing Sage 50 Payroll customers have taken this feature, and it's all additional revenue. \r\nSo adding value to existing customers is very important, but so is acquiring new ones. We acquired new customers in a number of areas, but there's 2 key areas where I'd like to talk about it: one is small customers, principally through Sage One; and the other is mid-market ERP through Sage ERP X3. \r\nFor small customers, in the U.K. alone, it is estimated that over 1.5 million small businesses still use spreadsheets. This is a significant amount of whitespace, and these potential new customers are clearly attracted to the cloud. It offers ease-of-use and no upfront costs. For the less -- for less than the cost of your monthly mobile phone bill, you can start to enjoy the convenience of using Sage One. \r\nIn mid-market, with Sage ERP X3 version 7, we have a very attractive product, which is using all the benefits of the cloud to give a compelling offer to customers. Adoption and pace of change in mid-market is slower than small businesses, but it's important to be able to offer connected solutions in this segment. \r\nAs I said earlier, it was a pivotal year for Sage One. This offering is now available in 10 markets, with the number of subscriptions increasing by 150% to 86,000. As part of our global focus, we redesigned some of the SaaS offerings to make them part of the Sage One family. If you just -- if you exclude these redesigned offerings, the Sage One base would have been 53,000. So I'm just giving you the numbers so you can relate them back to what we've disclosed previously. And of those 53,000, 47,000 was in the U.K. and Ireland. We've been very pleased to see the strong momentum in both U.K. and Ireland, but also in South Africa. \r\nIf you look at this graph, which is for U.K. and Ireland, you can see that we were somewhat late to market with our Sage One product. However, now that we're in the market with both accounting and payroll products, if you look at the adoption rate over the last couple of years, you can start to see how we're catching up. \r\nAs I said, North America is behind our ambitions. But again, compared to the U.K., we were a bit later to market in terms of introducing Sage One into the U.S. And Sage One Extra, which is the product with deeper functionality, which is available in the U.K., is only just about to be introduced in the U.S. So if you look at this graph, compare it to the U.S. in terms of rate of adoption and when we went into the market, that helps explain why we have a bit more work to do in the U.S. in order to get to where we need to be. And also secondly, we have some work to do around the channel, particularly the accountants channel, which is less well developed than it is in the U.K. \r\nSo cloud is making a big difference to Sage, and we're using it to improve customer experience for all our customers, both existing and new customers. Sage is here to serve customers of all generations, from young people starting up for the first time through to customers who've been with us for 30 years plus. \r\nThis slide uses subscription as an example to show the progress and the momentum that Sage has and how we continue to offer customers choice. We aim to have customers for life, and so the move to subscription will be progressive, with greatest pace taking place with smaller customers. We're pleased with the progress we're making. We've built a strong platform for future growth but in a way that our customers appreciate and value. \r\nSo to conclude. We exit the year with momentum in the cloud, with momentum in subscription and with momentum in revenue growth, particularly evidenced by the 7% recurring revenue growth. We reaffirm our guidance of achieving 6% organic revenue growth and 28% operating margin in FY '15, and we will achieve these targets with momentum and underpinned by strong free cash flow. \r\nStephen and I are already developing a good partnership, and we're looking forward to seeing you at the Capital Markets Day and presenting more around how we see increasing the pace of execution in Sage, and we look forward to seeing you then. Thank you.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Stephen Kelly (Executives)】\nThanks very much, Steve. What we'll do now is open it up to your questions. For also a couple of things, we got questions on the conference call line as well, so I might interject those. But it'd be really helpful if you could just say your name and the institution you represent as well when you kick off. Do you want to go on and go first? You got a mic, a roving mic as well, I should have said that, sorry.",
      "transcript_text3": "It's Adam Wood from Morgan Stanley. I've got 2, if I could. Just first of all, around investment, could you give us a little bit of a feel? Obviously, the software industry is going through a big transition towards cloud, Software as a Service. How do you think the product portfolio at Sage is set up for that? And kind of following on from that, with a greater move towards subscription and maybe some need to invest, how do you balance that investment? Is it the right time to taking margins up versus maybe investing more in the product portfolio and accelerating that move towards subscriptions? And then secondly, I think there's around 2 million customers on support and 6 million, roughly, customer installed base. In terms of the 4-million opportunity of getting them on to some sort of payment model, how do you think about that? How confident are you that those 6 million customers are actually there, still able to be sold to? Would you think about a forced subscription model, rather than a kind of more gentle push towards it?\n\n---\n\nOkay, I'll -- maybe a couple of things from the customers' perspective, and I'll pass to Steve from the financial perspective. So 2 things. One is, honestly, I get very excited about technology, really excited, so iPads and stuff, I got about 4 devices. When I go and talk to our customers, particularly in places like Germany, France, Spain, I see the reality that we're ahead of the curve. And when they're looking at their business, they're using words like indispensable, and we want to help understand this. And in Germany, there's still all the concerns about data security in the cloud, all that sort of stuff got replayed. And in fact, in the session I did in Bad Homburg, in Frankfurt, they were sort of saying, \"Hang on, Stephen. You're going way too fast on this stuff.\" So just let's balance it. Now what we're seeking to do, there are 2 parts to the cloud, really: one is the technology innovation, mobility and all the stuff, smack, okay, analytics and all that great stuff. The other thing is the business model change. So what we've done through our shift to subscription is mirror effectively a cloud revolution. In terms of what it means, it means I pay per play, which is great. So if you think about it from a cash flow planning for a small business, they want to have security. And if they have to lay off folks, they want to pay less. If they take on more folks, they need to expand their cost base accordingly. So effectively, we're doing a lot of things through what Steve talked about and the shift to subscription and away from the annuity of support and maintenance to actually mirror that reality. The other thing we say in terms of the shift, and I think this is credit to Guy and the management team, is 2012 clear strategy around embracing the cloud; also, shifting the investment model towards, fundamentally, the new world and making sure that we always gave our customers a choice there. So I think it's slightly different with some of the other folks, particularly in the U.S., who are doing sort of forced migrations. I think something customers love about Sage is we give them a choice. And if they're not ready to move their business because they're opening up in a different geography, or they taking on more staff, the last thing they want to do is worry about technology migration. So to have that security that they have the choice from Sage, I think, is important. Steve, anything on the financial side?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think on the customer numbers, I think the way to think about it is, as you said, Adam, roughly 2 million already on existing contracts, whether subscription or maintenance and support. There's close to probably another 1 million customers with whom we've had some sort of economic transaction in the last 3 years. So it means they've bought a product, but they've gone off the plan, so they don't have a maintenance and support contract. And it's those people who are the sort of first priority there, the people we've had the most recent contact with. They are the people who we want to use features, new product modernization, et cetera, to tempt back into the net. And then in terms of the 6 million, there's, obviously, people out there who have bought products a long time ago, and it's more costly, probably a lower probability in terms of targeting them. So we're taking them in that sort of order, people whom we've had more recent contact with first. The other thing is what I said about whitespace, I think particularly with Sage One, not just in the U.K. but in all the other markets in which we offer Sage One, there's a significant opportunity to get people to come into the net for the first time. And I think that is an important focus as well as reactivating existing customers. I think in terms of the forced subscription model, what we're trying to do is a balance, where there are some features, I used auto-enrollment in the U.K. as an example, where we're not forcing customers to take auto-enrollment. But if you want to, it's only available in subscription. So we're trying to use a gentle -- it's still offering choice, but we're not guaranteeing that everything we offer will have both license and subscription, but you get to choose whether you want to take that additional feature.\n\n---\n\nGood. And I think Charlie is holding the microphone, so, yes.\n\n---\n\nYes, Charlie Brennan here from Crédit Suisse. I've got 4, but they're very short questions. The first is just on Sage 50. You launched an updated version of that, including the subscription offer. Can you give us the stats around the numbers of people that took the license option versus the number of people that took the subscription option for Sage 50? The second question is just around your active contract number that looks like it's fallen year-on-year. How do we reconcile falling active customers with your commitment to ongoing growth? The third one is just on Sage One. There was, obviously, some very aggressive discounting around August and September, so can you give us some metrics there around the average revenue per user on Sage One? And the last one, just on R&D, the headline number looks like it's fallen about 9% year-on-year. Can you just give us what the organic trend was there?\n\n---\n\nYou got it, 4 for the price of 1, Charlie. Steve?\n\n---\n\nSo starting with Sage 50, when we first launched the upgrade around August time, we did offer some discounting around the upfront license, so we gave greater choice in the initial launch phase. And then what we did in September, partway through September, and what we're doing now is we're making the subscription a lot more attractive. So if you look at what's happened in September, and you look at what's happened over the last couple of months, there is -- the vast majority of people signing up to the new version of Sage 50 are going subscription. But in August, it was the other way around, but it was only for that 1 month. And in terms of active contracts, there has been some consolidation of contracts, and this is partly as a result of the move from maintenance and support to subscription, because what happens in maintenance and support contract is that, typically, they're product driven. So if you take out a maintenance and support contract, let's use Sage 50 as an example, you'll take it out for Sage 50 accounts. And then when you sign up for the payroll product, you'll have a separate contract for Sage 50 Payroll. So as an individual, you would have 2 contacts because you've got 2 separate support contracts for those 2 products. When you go to subscription, it's bundled. So that 2 contracts becomes 1. So actually, the number of true active customers hasn't really fallen, but what you have seen is a switch. Because of the switch, particularly from maintenance and support to subscription, the number of contracts is lower, but the number of customers is not. On Sage One, everyone in the small business space, attracting new customers is offering deals. So everyone offers free trials, everyone offers discounts in the early phases in order to attract customers, and we do exactly the same. In terms of long term, once you've signed up, they -- what we're charging for Sage One isn't particularly that much different from what we were charging before. There's just a lot of attractive offers to sign you up in the first place. To give you a feel for sort of average revenues, obviously, early days. We quoted that we had 86,000 Sage One subscribers or Sage One subscriptions, and the revenue was just over GBP 2 million in FY '14. On R&D, R&D on an organic basis continues to track at around 10% of revenue. I think the way Stephen and I see R&D is that it's something that we're very focused on in terms of how we allocate between the Invest products and the other products. But what I would say is that we have something like 2,200, 2,300 R&D engineers, so sometimes, people say, \"well, are you sure you're spending enough on R&D?\" 2,200 engineers feels like a lot to me.\n\n---\n\nYes, to add on that, Charlie, I'd just pick it up. I'm aware of companies. In the last 10 years I've been involved around the cloud who've got products to market in 3 to 6 months. One of the competitors in our space has got 20 engineers, 20, 2-0. Another 1 has got 12 engineers. We've got over 2,000 engineers. That's why you're kind of shifting the dial around execution and productivity. And the strategy's all well and good, but then it's all about the execution of that. I think we got plenty of firepower, we feel, in our engineering function to actually look after our customers as they are today with the on-premise, pursue the strategy around moving to Invest, but also significant firepower to build some of the global products like Sage One in the cloud and exploiting the new technologies. We'll go with Michael.\n\n---\n\nMichael Briest, UBS. Steve, I think you said that for the first half, you expected growth to be in the low end of the range. Can you sort of say what that range is or why albeit the sort of slower first half? And then in terms of the acquisition/investments, I noticed you don't repeat the 1x leverage target you talk about, potentially doing periodic returns of excess cash. Can you talk a little bit about what the balance sheet should look like? Could you -- do you think that maybe the business can run with more leverage than the 1x target you've had historically? And then just finally, on Sage One, can you say maybe what the churn rate is in the U.K.? It's been running now for a few years. You should have a feel for that statistic.\n\n---\n\nWant me to say this?\n\n---\n\nYes, yes.\n\n---\n\nSo H1 growth, the reason I'm being a bit cautious around H1 growth is because I think the areas of weakness that we've pointed to of U.S. payments and European mid-market, where I think we've done a lot of the right things, I'm just a bit cautious about how the pipeline converts. So I can see that it's starting to happen, but I'm just a bit cautious around it. So I think you'll see -- we've just reported for the year a 4.9% growth. H1 isn't going to be -- H1 will be above that, but I just don't specifically want to be drawn how far above it. But we -- as you've seen from both Stephen and I, there is no kind of hesitation whatsoever in reconfirming the guidance for FY '15. We just think it might be a bit more back-end loaded. And on the capital structure, the 1x leverage remains the guidance that we're aiming to, to be there or thereabouts. We're not going to be a slave to it arithmetically. So sometimes, we might be slightly above; sometimes, we might be slightly below. But as a guidance, we still expect roughly to be at 1x as we do -- if we do bolt-on acquisitions, we may go above that to do those acquisitions and then bring it back down again as we generate cash. But there hasn't been any change of policy, but we see it as a guiding principle, rather than something that we're a slave to. And on Sage One, yes, in the U.K., the churn rates are now down into single digits.\n\n---\n\nYes, just picking up as well on the finer points. Steve has spent time reaffirming the plans in terms of '15, and that's why we can stand up here with confidence. And obviously, you'd expect me -- many of you know me. I haven't met every country manager, over 90% of the revenue for the fiscal year, ask them the questions and look them in the eyes to stand up here today. So that's -- the first 3 weeks of my life at Sage was going around, meeting customers, people and spending a little bit of time with country managers and making sure they clearly know our responsibilities. Stacy we go. Just use the microphone. We'll come back to you. Stacy?\n\n---\n\nStacy Pollard with JPMorgan. Just to dig in a little bit around the pricing, so a pricing question. How does your cloud pricing and subscription pricing sort of compare to your on-premise license and support? And is it the sort of typical 3- to 4-year total cost or, from your perspective, total revenue where that line crosses? That's one question. And then the second one, again, to follow up on acquisitions, are you still interested in acquisitions? To what purpose would that be, for technology or geography or what interest?\n\n---\n\nOkay, do you want to -- maybe I'll start flipping around the acquisitions first.\n\n---\n\nSure.\n\n---\n\nSo consistency of strategy, consistency with what the board have worked on, this is consistency of 2012. So -- and PayChoice is a good example of that. So if we can accelerate the strategy, then we consider acquisitions. But Steve and I are very execution focused. The other thing I think we should say is around the organic strategy. The world of the cloud and what that offers is we can develop products quicker than we could have done 10 years ago, so we're certainly focused on that area. And then maybe you do the first question.\n\n---\n\nYes, on the pricing, Sage is a -- has historically been a very decentralized business, so there isn't one answer for every country. The -- France, U.K., South Africa, Brazil and North America are doing slightly different things, depending on what they think the market conditions are. And also we are, depending on what's common in the marketplace. In some cases, like the example I quoted in France, we're using activation fees, so were not necessarily making the migration to subscription completely free of charge. Whereas in other countries, we are. But to answer the question at a higher level, if you compare license fees to what we then charge for monthly subscription, it tends to be at the lower end of that sort of range that you're talking about. So if you look at the -- how we're pricing subscription, it tends to be more in the 2 to 3 years than the 3 to 4. And in some cases, it may even be lower. But it's -- but where it's lower, it's not necessarily a like-for-like comparison because where we sell the license, we're giving the customer the software with 100% of the functionality. When we move it to subscription, and particularly where we're using cloud products, the starting point is a lower level of functionality, which you then add to as you go up through the various tiers. So you can go on the website, and you can compare the different pricing between licensing and subscription, but it's not straightforward to compare apples with apples.\n\n---\n\nLet's take one from over here, and then we'll come back to there. Go for David.\n\n---\n\nIt's David Toms from Numis. Just a couple from me. Digging into Charlie's question a bit about ARPU, and the implied ARPU. If we assume sort of 50,000 or so average subscribers for the year on cloud and GBP 2 million of revenue, that's implying an ARPU of about GBP 3 a month. The figure we were given a year ago was about GBP 8.50 a month. Now realizing it might not have been entirely like-for-like, that's a very, very big difference, so can you just explain sort of why the delta is so great there? And then secondly, just on working capital, you sort of had a slight throwaway comment when you were running through the numbers, Steve, saying the working capital had been a little bit light. Given the increasing importance of recurring revenue of the business and the decreasing importance of SSRS, why aren't we seeing working capital being a little bit better as you collect that upfront cash from people?\n\n---\n\nYes, so let me take the ARPU first. The rates, if you look at the rate of adoption of Sage One, it's more back-end loaded. Also, these are worldwide figures now, so they include South Africa. So pricing in South Africa is generally lower. So I mean, I think we -- because of the early discounting, because of what it takes to acquire customers, it is true that the ARPU is going to be lower in the early stages of acquiring these customers because we offer -- we don't just offer free trials, we offer half-price deals, we offer very significant discounting in those early months. But that's the way the model works in this environment. We're competing against people who offer products for free, who offer extremely low pricing. And we need to capture the customer, we need to get the customer into the Sage One family, get them to understand the benefits of the product, and then we need to get them to a place where the ARPU makes sense. But in the early days of customer acquisition, you will see periods where the ARPU is low. On the working capital, to be honest, the biggest reason for the Q4 -- sorry, for the slight drop in conversion is we said in the Q3 IMS that Q3 haven't been -- have been a little bit weaker than we'd expected, so therefore, by definition, Q4 was a bit stronger, so the revenue has been a bit more back-end loaded in Q4. Although -- France would be a good example. In France, most of the subscription and most of the maintenance and support contracts, we invoice upfront, so we invoice annual contracts upfront. But it doesn't -- but we still give people credit, so -- and people still get 30, 60 days credit. And the DSOs have gone up a little bit in France at the year-end. We haven't seen any real impact going to subscription in terms of how it's affected cash flow because most of the maintenance and support contracts were already annual in advance. So even though we switch to subscription, most of them are still annual in advance. In some cases, we are going to monthly. So the U.K., for example, Sage 50 subscription is monthly; it's monthly direct debit. So if we see more of the switch to monthly, we may see some temporary dips in cash conversion because we -- if we go from full annual to monthly, we may see a dip. We haven't seen that yet, but it's a possibility. So I think there could be some inconsistency on a period-by-period basis in terms of the cash conversion. But if you look long term in terms of the trend, the more we can get people onto automated billing, automated collection, direct debit, that type of thing, you're going to get much more predictable cash flows, and that's where we're trying to get to.\n\n---\n\nIt's John King from Merrill Lynch. Just a couple of questions, if it's okay to follow up on the Sage One side of things. Could you give us some -- any sense of sort of the adoption in Sage One Extra in the U.K.? Obviously, you've launched that for a little bit of time now, so I'm just wondering if you're seeing the pickup there as well. And I suppose related to that, if you could just give a view, referring back to the R&D question, how much of your customer base today would have the opportunity, if they wanted to, to go out and migrate to a public cloud solution? And if you look forward at the current rate of development, where would that number stand in 12 months? Hence, how quickly could we see a full portfolio of offerings, where your customers could move to the cloud as and when they want to?\n\n---\n\nSo maybe I'll start. So I think, pretty clearly, we've done a good job of loving customers, but the reality is we know there's a lot of whitespace, Steve referenced the Excel users, and also a lot of new entrepreneurs starting businesses, and that's the target audience that we are pursuing with a product like Sage One. What we plan to do in terms of the wider question on R&D and the strategy looking ahead is actually host you back in the summer and give you a view of the strategy. But Steve, do you want to -- you got the data in front of you now?\n\n---\n\nYes, so Sage One, actually, we've got just under 3,000 of our 86,000 in Sage One Extra.\n\n---\n\nOkay here, Milan?\n\n---\n\nMilan Radia from Jefferies. First on X3, I guess it continues to attract less attention than Sage One and Sage One Extra as we see it today. Where have you got to now in terms of the number of partners, the average deployment value there? And where could X3 be in, say, 3 years' time as a proportion of revenue? And then on the cloud kind of competitive landscape, we've seen NetSuite and others, obviously, emphasize their European expansion plans. Witnessed your own war of words with one of those companies on Twitter. Are you doing enough to establish your cloud potentials in territories such as Germany? I mean, we heard a little bit about France and the U.K. but not much discussion around some of those other European countries where the competitors are obviously laying out some infrastructure.\n\n---\n\nOkay, maybe double-head, I'll start and then pass to you. So I think it's interesting, everybody gets very excited about cloud. The opportunity on the revenue side as well is in the mid-market, and we got great credentials there with the X3 product line. So I won't break this out probably every time we get together, but for this occasion, last year, we won 561 new customers with the X3 product line. Interesting enough, as you mentioned one of the companies, well, we always welcome competition, and it's good for the market, good for customers, good for us to innovate our products, so we always welcome lots of healthy competition. And we saw lots of that first [ph] in the Financial Times and welcome companies investing in British advertising. So that's always something we relish. Now the reality, though, is, say, take the U.K. as a microcosm. On the X3 product line, we will -- we had a win rate of 66% of sales campaigns we're involved in. And that particular company was seen on less than a handful of transactions. And the -- actually, again, the reality of all these things is the customer, so the customer feedback on those where we had a really high win rate was 3 reasons why they choose Sage X3: one is functionality is superior; secondly, a big reason, our total cost of ownership being less; and the third reason actually plays straight into our core strength, particularly in Europe, is around local support. They really value local support from local-language people basically down the road or on the phone. And they were the kind of things that resonated strongly. But I would say we sit here and think that's actually an opportunity for probably better execution. And certainly, as a global product, we've had some success. We've highlighted the soft spot in terms of France. We've made some management changes around there, and I think we've certainly got our arms around what needs to be fixed there. Steve, do you want to add on that?\n\n---\n\nYes, and we have -- at the year-end, we had a -- we got about 4,800 customers for X3, and we've got about 290 business partners.\n\n---\n\nIn terms of where that revenue could get to over, say, 3 years?\n\n---\n\nI don't give guidance, but that's a great question for the summer, great question for the summer and something in our minds for the next few months. Go [indiscernible], yes, then we'll just go back.\n\n---\n\nAmit Harchandani from Citigroup. Just one question in terms of your outlook or guidance for 2015, come across as fairly confident about achieving the same on the top line. If you could just elaborate a bit more on the various drivers that underpin this particular level of confidence. Is this the recurring revenue performance in Europe? Is it the stabilization in North America and the potential improvements? If you could maybe just drill down which drivers you expect to remain stable? And where do you expect more confidence to come through the course of the next 12 months?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think one of the critical ingredients is Europe. If you look back over the last sort of 3 years, most people's skepticism around the growth trajectory of Sage was around whether Europe as a whole would be a continuing drag on that growth, and could we really grow Europe at something around the 6% mark. I think the fact that we've achieved 7% recurring revenue growth in Europe is pretty significant. We have very strong growth in both U.K. and France, which are the 2 biggest countries. We have a lot of momentum around subscription in both of those countries. And also, although I'm a bit cautious in the first half, I think the opportunity for recovery in mid-market Europe could be a significant part and also the building block. And we see North America, which has had -- 4% growth this year was okay, but we can see reasons why that will bump up a bit next year. So I think if you take AAMEA -- and Brazil is relatively small. But if you take AAMEA and Brazil, it's continuing to be kind of the cornerstones, contributors that they've been in the past, and then both Europe and North America continue with some of the trajectory that we can currently see, you get to 6%.\n\n---\n\nDo you want to try? Into the middle we move.\n\n---\n\nIt's Mohammed Moawalla from Goldman Sachs. Stephen, can you talk a bit about the product portfolio? You talked about the feedback from the customers. You also kind of touched on the kind of the big R&D base you have. Is there room to kind of further accelerate or simplify the product range as you look forward, particularly as you move to these kind of multi-geography cloud products? And is that sort of a big -- how big of a lever this could be on kind of the longer-term margin? And then secondly, just to follow up on the payments business in North America, can you just drill a bit, Steve, on the -- is this a competitive issue or an execution issue? And you alluded to kind of a -- still a tough first half next year, but what the kind of the medium-term outlook for that business is?\n\n---\n\nOkay, maybe I'll take the first and then the second. So I guess many of you know Steve and myself, and I think the opportunity that we have with 2,000 engineers around spreading the 1-face message and taking forward the 2012 strategy. So that -- what that said is product rationalization, shift the investments towards invest in growth and, obviously, exploit the opportunities in disruption in the cloud, and it's kind of our job as the management to ensure that we accelerate that. So the answer is obviously yes. Could we do better? Yes, no doubt about it. There's always -- any business of our scale, there's areas we can do better and improve on. So in terms of where I'd see -- a bit of a sneak preview into the summer, when we'd love to get you back together and lift our eyes to the next few years of how we can build global products. So essentially, when I -- from the U.S., from the German visits, broadly, payroll is probably more country specific; but generally, 60% to 70% global requirements; and then the regulatory local requirements are the additional 30%. In some of the core accounting products, it's probably 80%. So that sort of tells me strategies around Sage One and these global products we're driving in X3 absolutely means that we've got an excellent position. And actually, ironically, being a European company and understanding the complexity of the countries around Europe and the different regulatory environment and the compliance requirement, probably they're quite a significant advantage to us. So then it all comes back to better execution. And what we'd love to do again maybe around that, make some progress over the next few months, but in reality, come back to you in the summer and lift our eyes up about the opportunity going forward. Do you want to talk to the payments business initiative?\n\n---\n\nYes, I mean, the payments business is -- for FY '14 was essentially flat. And some of that market, I think, a number of players, including Intuit, have pointed to the market being a bit more competitive and pricing being tough. But I do think also we've had some execution issues in terms of how we've gone about addressing the market. We did lose one of our channel partners, which also had an impact on the numbers this year. And I think with some of the actions that we've taken, there's reasons why we'll start to see that recovery and that business returning to growth. But the reason I'm cautious is the same reason I'm cautious in mid-market. When businesses are turning, I've just seen it so many times before, where the pipeline starts to fill, but the time it takes to really start to convert that pipeline and really start to see the traction returning to the business, I'm always a bit cautious about how long that's going to take. Now hopefully, I'll be positively surprised, but I'm the CFO, so I'm paid to be cautious.\n\n---\n\nIt's good to be a bit cautious. And on some of these things, we don't want to get ahead of ourselves. Steve's been here less than a year. I've been here 21 working days. So today was all about good results, reaffirmation of guidance, and then pointing us to the summer, where we'll lift our eyes and answer a lot of these questions that are on your minds. Maybe one more question. Can I go to the phones first, though? And we got a question, so hopefully be the voice of God.\n\n---\n\nTwo, if I may. First, on the kind of future kind of growth, if you look on Sage over the last kind of cycle or so, support growth has always been relatively decent but SSRS remained weak, and again, that was the case in the second half and then for the full year. When do you think that will kind of come back to kind of growth? And what kind of growth would you expect this to deliver over the kind of cycle? And then secondly, coming back on the payment business, the large proportion, I believe, is in the U.S., where you're competing with larger players, and that market is simply commoditized and so it's probably tough for you guys to find ever there a significant kind of growth. So my question on the U.S. there is, would you double up there to kind of gain the kind of scale you need? Or is this potentially something you need to kind of build down? And then in Europe, where there was more growth, still a very fragmented industry, but again, Sage Pay is relatively small. So again there, a similar kind of question, do you need to consider acquisitions there to accelerate the kind of growth?\n\n---\n\nSteve, do you want to?\n\n---\n\nYes. So if you take -- if we take the revenue growth question first, we don't really expect to see SSRS return to growth as part of the plans of achieving the 6% organic growth. And that's really -- the only exception to that would be that we will start to see some -- potentially, some greater impact from mid-market and all the -- and mid-market is more likely to be license than it is subscription just because of the nature of the way that market's working. But the reason we don't expect to see strong SSRS growth is because we're driving subscription. So SSRS is largely driven by license fees, which are getting replaced by subscription. From time to time, we'll see some pickup because of mid-market and also because of professional services. But if you take the trend over a long period of time, we're not expecting to see SSRS growth. On payments, I guess 2 parts to that or 2 parts to the answer. The first is with all the payments businesses, part of the reason we own payments businesses is cross sell. So whilst the market is more competitive, we also have a compelling story to our existing installed base about integrating payments into the offering. And as I said earlier, the penetration of that cross sell, although it's greater in North America than it is in Europe, there still remains a significant opportunity and a significant advantage to our customers for offering them integrated solutions including payments. On the acquisition side, I guess I would see payments very similar to the rest of the business in that the right bolt-on acquisitions might well be appropriate for payments, just like they might well be appropriate for the rest of the business. But at the moment, we're not singling out payments in any way to say that, that -- there's more of a strategic imperative in payments than it is anywhere else. It may be, but it's not something that's a sort of burning platform that we feel we need to action in order to be successful.\n\n---\n\nGood, Steve. And we'd love to take lots more of your questions, but I think the last one today is in the middle.\n\n---\n\nNeil Steer, Redburn. In fact, I think, Steve, you partially answered this question, but it was during the presentation, you referred to the integration of the most recent acquisition. Obviously, integration and leverage from M&A activities is not something we're sort of accustomed to seeing in the past from Sage. Now the question was really, what are you doing different in terms of integrating that business now that we perhaps wouldn't have seen under the previous management team?\n\n---\n\nWell, I think I'd refer to Stephen's comments around one Sage. I think in the past, Sage was perhaps organized, or historically -- this has slightly changed over time. But originally, it was organized really as -- almost as a series of individual businesses, so very independent businesses. So when an acquisition took place, apart from the -- that business joining the family, it largely continued to operate in a similar or even the same way as it did before we bought it. When we buy now, it will be because we see synergies. We're not going to buy -- we're going to acquire things to acquire revenue and just leave it standalone. We will buy things because either, from a technology perspective, we think we can integrate into our existing suite of products and services to sell to a wider customer base, or it'll be because we want to acquire customers which we then cross-sell our existing products into as well. So the -- PayChoice is a good example of that. The reason why we bought PayChoice is because they have a SaaS payroll product, and so there's a 2-way opportunity. We acquire both technology and customers. The customers we acquire, we will, over time, be introducing them to the wider suite of Sage products. But also, we want the payroll SaaS platform to sell into our existing installed base. So there are clear synergies, and that's the type of deal that you're likely to see us doing in the future. It's important that there's synergistic value.\n\n---\n\nAnd just be clear, that's international transfer [indiscernible]?\n\n---\n\nYes, actually, in the case of PayChoice for the time being, it's a U.S. solution. It could be that we build on that, but we already -- the reason we did it in the U.S. was because we didn't have a U.S. payroll product, really, whereas we do in Europe.\n\n---\n\nThat's great. Thank you very much for your attention and support. And also, I just want to say thanks to Guy and the existing management team for a good set of results. And our commitment, Steve and I as the management team, and the board, is to absolutely assure everybody here we're very committed to short-, medium- and long-term success to our investor community, our great investors, and to deliver excellent returns from Sage. Thank you very much.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Adam Wood (Analysts)】\nIt's Adam Wood from Morgan Stanley. I've got 2, if I could. Just first of all, around investment, could you give us a little bit of a feel? Obviously, the software industry is going through a big transition towards cloud, Software as a Service. How do you think the product portfolio at Sage is set up for that? And kind of following on from that, with a greater move towards subscription and maybe some need to invest, how do you balance that investment? Is it the right time to taking margins up versus maybe investing more in the product portfolio and accelerating that move towards subscriptions? And then secondly, I think there's around 2 million customers on support and 6 million, roughly, customer installed base. In terms of the 4-million opportunity of getting them on to some sort of payment model, how do you think about that? How confident are you that those 6 million customers are actually there, still able to be sold to? Would you think about a forced subscription model, rather than a kind of more gentle push towards it?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Kelly (Executives)】\nOkay, I'll -- maybe a couple of things from the customers' perspective, and I'll pass to Steve from the financial perspective. So 2 things. One is, honestly, I get very excited about technology, really excited, so iPads and stuff, I got about 4 devices. When I go and talk to our customers, particularly in places like Germany, France, Spain, I see the reality that we're ahead of the curve. And when they're looking at their business, they're using words like indispensable, and we want to help understand this. And in Germany, there's still all the concerns about data security in the cloud, all that sort of stuff got replayed. And in fact, in the session I did in Bad Homburg, in Frankfurt, they were sort of saying, \"Hang on, Stephen. You're going way too fast on this stuff.\" So just let's balance it. Now what we're seeking to do, there are 2 parts to the cloud, really: one is the technology innovation, mobility and all the stuff, smack, okay, analytics and all that great stuff. The other thing is the business model change. So what we've done through our shift to subscription is mirror effectively a cloud revolution. In terms of what it means, it means I pay per play, which is great. So if you think about it from a cash flow planning for a small business, they want to have security. And if they have to lay off folks, they want to pay less. If they take on more folks, they need to expand their cost base accordingly. So effectively, we're doing a lot of things through what Steve talked about and the shift to subscription and away from the annuity of support and maintenance to actually mirror that reality. The other thing we say in terms of the shift, and I think this is credit to Guy and the management team, is 2012 clear strategy around embracing the cloud; also, shifting the investment model towards, fundamentally, the new world and making sure that we always gave our customers a choice there. So I think it's slightly different with some of the other folks, particularly in the U.S., who are doing sort of forced migrations. I think something customers love about Sage is we give them a choice. And if they're not ready to move their business because they're opening up in a different geography, or they taking on more staff, the last thing they want to do is worry about technology migration. So to have that security that they have the choice from Sage, I think, is important. Steve, anything on the financial side?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Hare (Executives)】\nYes, I think on the customer numbers, I think the way to think about it is, as you said, Adam, roughly 2 million already on existing contracts, whether subscription or maintenance and support. There's close to probably another 1 million customers with whom we've had some sort of economic transaction in the last 3 years. So it means they've bought a product, but they've gone off the plan, so they don't have a maintenance and support contract. And it's those people who are the sort of first priority there, the people we've had the most recent contact with. They are the people who we want to use features, new product modernization, et cetera, to tempt back into the net. And then in terms of the 6 million, there's, obviously, people out there who have bought products a long time ago, and it's more costly, probably a lower probability in terms of targeting them. So we're taking them in that sort of order, people whom we've had more recent contact with first. The other thing is what I said about whitespace, I think particularly with Sage One, not just in the U.K. but in all the other markets in which we offer Sage One, there's a significant opportunity to get people to come into the net for the first time. And I think that is an important focus as well as reactivating existing customers. I think in terms of the forced subscription model, what we're trying to do is a balance, where there are some features, I used auto-enrollment in the U.K. as an example, where we're not forcing customers to take auto-enrollment. But if you want to, it's only available in subscription. So we're trying to use a gentle -- it's still offering choice, but we're not guaranteeing that everything we offer will have both license and subscription, but you get to choose whether you want to take that additional feature.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Kelly (Executives)】\nGood. And I think Charlie is holding the microphone, so, yes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Brennan (Analysts)】\nYes, Charlie Brennan here from Crédit Suisse. I've got 4, but they're very short questions. The first is just on Sage 50. You launched an updated version of that, including the subscription offer. Can you give us the stats around the numbers of people that took the license option versus the number of people that took the subscription option for Sage 50? The second question is just around your active contract number that looks like it's fallen year-on-year. How do we reconcile falling active customers with your commitment to ongoing growth? The third one is just on Sage One. There was, obviously, some very aggressive discounting around August and September, so can you give us some metrics there around the average revenue per user on Sage One? And the last one, just on R&D, the headline number looks like it's fallen about 9% year-on-year. Can you just give us what the organic trend was there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Kelly (Executives)】\nYou got it, 4 for the price of 1, Charlie. Steve?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Hare (Executives)】\nSo starting with Sage 50, when we first launched the upgrade around August time, we did offer some discounting around the upfront license, so we gave greater choice in the initial launch phase. And then what we did in September, partway through September, and what we're doing now is we're making the subscription a lot more attractive. So if you look at what's happened in September, and you look at what's happened over the last couple of months, there is -- the vast majority of people signing up to the new version of Sage 50 are going subscription. But in August, it was the other way around, but it was only for that 1 month. And in terms of active contracts, there has been some consolidation of contracts, and this is partly as a result of the move from maintenance and support to subscription, because what happens in maintenance and support contract is that, typically, they're product driven. So if you take out a maintenance and support contract, let's use Sage 50 as an example, you'll take it out for Sage 50 accounts. And then when you sign up for the payroll product, you'll have a separate contract for Sage 50 Payroll. So as an individual, you would have 2 contacts because you've got 2 separate support contracts for those 2 products. When you go to subscription, it's bundled. So that 2 contracts becomes 1. So actually, the number of true active customers hasn't really fallen, but what you have seen is a switch. Because of the switch, particularly from maintenance and support to subscription, the number of contracts is lower, but the number of customers is not. On Sage One, everyone in the small business space, attracting new customers is offering deals. So everyone offers free trials, everyone offers discounts in the early phases in order to attract customers, and we do exactly the same. In terms of long term, once you've signed up, they -- what we're charging for Sage One isn't particularly that much different from what we were charging before. There's just a lot of attractive offers to sign you up in the first place. To give you a feel for sort of average revenues, obviously, early days. We quoted that we had 86,000 Sage One subscribers or Sage One subscriptions, and the revenue was just over GBP 2 million in FY '14. On R&D, R&D on an organic basis continues to track at around 10% of revenue. I think the way Stephen and I see R&D is that it's something that we're very focused on in terms of how we allocate between the Invest products and the other products. But what I would say is that we have something like 2,200, 2,300 R&D engineers, so sometimes, people say, \"well, are you sure you're spending enough on R&D?\" 2,200 engineers feels like a lot to me.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Kelly (Executives)】\nYes, to add on that, Charlie, I'd just pick it up. I'm aware of companies. In the last 10 years I've been involved around the cloud who've got products to market in 3 to 6 months. One of the competitors in our space has got 20 engineers, 20, 2-0. Another 1 has got 12 engineers. We've got over 2,000 engineers. That's why you're kind of shifting the dial around execution and productivity. And the strategy's all well and good, but then it's all about the execution of that. I think we got plenty of firepower, we feel, in our engineering function to actually look after our customers as they are today with the on-premise, pursue the strategy around moving to Invest, but also significant firepower to build some of the global products like Sage One in the cloud and exploiting the new technologies. We'll go with Michael.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Briest (Analysts)】\nMichael Briest, UBS. Steve, I think you said that for the first half, you expected growth to be in the low end of the range. Can you sort of say what that range is or why albeit the sort of slower first half? And then in terms of the acquisition/investments, I noticed you don't repeat the 1x leverage target you talk about, potentially doing periodic returns of excess cash. Can you talk a little bit about what the balance sheet should look like? Could you -- do you think that maybe the business can run with more leverage than the 1x target you've had historically? And then just finally, on Sage One, can you say maybe what the churn rate is in the U.K.? It's been running now for a few years. You should have a feel for that statistic.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Hare (Executives)】\nWant me to say this?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Kelly (Executives)】\nYes, yes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Hare (Executives)】\nSo H1 growth, the reason I'm being a bit cautious around H1 growth is because I think the areas of weakness that we've pointed to of U.S. payments and European mid-market, where I think we've done a lot of the right things, I'm just a bit cautious about how the pipeline converts. So I can see that it's starting to happen, but I'm just a bit cautious around it. So I think you'll see -- we've just reported for the year a 4.9% growth. H1 isn't going to be -- H1 will be above that, but I just don't specifically want to be drawn how far above it. But we -- as you've seen from both Stephen and I, there is no kind of hesitation whatsoever in reconfirming the guidance for FY '15. We just think it might be a bit more back-end loaded. And on the capital structure, the 1x leverage remains the guidance that we're aiming to, to be there or thereabouts. We're not going to be a slave to it arithmetically. So sometimes, we might be slightly above; sometimes, we might be slightly below. But as a guidance, we still expect roughly to be at 1x as we do -- if we do bolt-on acquisitions, we may go above that to do those acquisitions and then bring it back down again as we generate cash. But there hasn't been any change of policy, but we see it as a guiding principle, rather than something that we're a slave to. And on Sage One, yes, in the U.K., the churn rates are now down into single digits.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Kelly (Executives)】\nYes, just picking up as well on the finer points. Steve has spent time reaffirming the plans in terms of '15, and that's why we can stand up here with confidence. And obviously, you'd expect me -- many of you know me. I haven't met every country manager, over 90% of the revenue for the fiscal year, ask them the questions and look them in the eyes to stand up here today. So that's -- the first 3 weeks of my life at Sage was going around, meeting customers, people and spending a little bit of time with country managers and making sure they clearly know our responsibilities. Stacy we go. Just use the microphone. We'll come back to you. Stacy?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Stacy Pollard (Analysts)】\nStacy Pollard with JPMorgan. Just to dig in a little bit around the pricing, so a pricing question. How does your cloud pricing and subscription pricing sort of compare to your on-premise license and support? And is it the sort of typical 3- to 4-year total cost or, from your perspective, total revenue where that line crosses? That's one question. And then the second one, again, to follow up on acquisitions, are you still interested in acquisitions? To what purpose would that be, for technology or geography or what interest?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Kelly (Executives)】\nOkay, do you want to -- maybe I'll start flipping around the acquisitions first.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Hare (Executives)】\nSure.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Kelly (Executives)】\nSo consistency of strategy, consistency with what the board have worked on, this is consistency of 2012. So -- and PayChoice is a good example of that. So if we can accelerate the strategy, then we consider acquisitions. But Steve and I are very execution focused. The other thing I think we should say is around the organic strategy. The world of the cloud and what that offers is we can develop products quicker than we could have done 10 years ago, so we're certainly focused on that area. And then maybe you do the first question.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Hare (Executives)】\nYes, on the pricing, Sage is a -- has historically been a very decentralized business, so there isn't one answer for every country. The -- France, U.K., South Africa, Brazil and North America are doing slightly different things, depending on what they think the market conditions are. And also we are, depending on what's common in the marketplace. In some cases, like the example I quoted in France, we're using activation fees, so were not necessarily making the migration to subscription completely free of charge. Whereas in other countries, we are. But to answer the question at a higher level, if you compare license fees to what we then charge for monthly subscription, it tends to be at the lower end of that sort of range that you're talking about. So if you look at the -- how we're pricing subscription, it tends to be more in the 2 to 3 years than the 3 to 4. And in some cases, it may even be lower. But it's -- but where it's lower, it's not necessarily a like-for-like comparison because where we sell the license, we're giving the customer the software with 100% of the functionality. When we move it to subscription, and particularly where we're using cloud products, the starting point is a lower level of functionality, which you then add to as you go up through the various tiers. So you can go on the website, and you can compare the different pricing between licensing and subscription, but it's not straightforward to compare apples with apples.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Kelly (Executives)】\nLet's take one from over here, and then we'll come back to there. Go for David.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Toms (Analysts)】\nIt's David Toms from Numis. Just a couple from me. Digging into Charlie's question a bit about ARPU, and the implied ARPU. If we assume sort of 50,000 or so average subscribers for the year on cloud and GBP 2 million of revenue, that's implying an ARPU of about GBP 3 a month. The figure we were given a year ago was about GBP 8.50 a month. Now realizing it might not have been entirely like-for-like, that's a very, very big difference, so can you just explain sort of why the delta is so great there? And then secondly, just on working capital, you sort of had a slight throwaway comment when you were running through the numbers, Steve, saying the working capital had been a little bit light. Given the increasing importance of recurring revenue of the business and the decreasing importance of SSRS, why aren't we seeing working capital being a little bit better as you collect that upfront cash from people?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Hare (Executives)】\nYes, so let me take the ARPU first. The rates, if you look at the rate of adoption of Sage One, it's more back-end loaded. Also, these are worldwide figures now, so they include South Africa. So pricing in South Africa is generally lower. So I mean, I think we -- because of the early discounting, because of what it takes to acquire customers, it is true that the ARPU is going to be lower in the early stages of acquiring these customers because we offer -- we don't just offer free trials, we offer half-price deals, we offer very significant discounting in those early months. But that's the way the model works in this environment. We're competing against people who offer products for free, who offer extremely low pricing. And we need to capture the customer, we need to get the customer into the Sage One family, get them to understand the benefits of the product, and then we need to get them to a place where the ARPU makes sense. But in the early days of customer acquisition, you will see periods where the ARPU is low. On the working capital, to be honest, the biggest reason for the Q4 -- sorry, for the slight drop in conversion is we said in the Q3 IMS that Q3 haven't been -- have been a little bit weaker than we'd expected, so therefore, by definition, Q4 was a bit stronger, so the revenue has been a bit more back-end loaded in Q4. Although -- France would be a good example. In France, most of the subscription and most of the maintenance and support contracts, we invoice upfront, so we invoice annual contracts upfront. But it doesn't -- but we still give people credit, so -- and people still get 30, 60 days credit. And the DSOs have gone up a little bit in France at the year-end. We haven't seen any real impact going to subscription in terms of how it's affected cash flow because most of the maintenance and support contracts were already annual in advance. So even though we switch to subscription, most of them are still annual in advance. In some cases, we are going to monthly. So the U.K., for example, Sage 50 subscription is monthly; it's monthly direct debit. So if we see more of the switch to monthly, we may see some temporary dips in cash conversion because we -- if we go from full annual to monthly, we may see a dip. We haven't seen that yet, but it's a possibility. So I think there could be some inconsistency on a period-by-period basis in terms of the cash conversion. But if you look long term in terms of the trend, the more we can get people onto automated billing, automated collection, direct debit, that type of thing, you're going to get much more predictable cash flows, and that's where we're trying to get to.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John King (Analysts)】\nIt's John King from Merrill Lynch. Just a couple of questions, if it's okay to follow up on the Sage One side of things. Could you give us some -- any sense of sort of the adoption in Sage One Extra in the U.K.? Obviously, you've launched that for a little bit of time now, so I'm just wondering if you're seeing the pickup there as well. And I suppose related to that, if you could just give a view, referring back to the R&D question, how much of your customer base today would have the opportunity, if they wanted to, to go out and migrate to a public cloud solution? And if you look forward at the current rate of development, where would that number stand in 12 months? Hence, how quickly could we see a full portfolio of offerings, where your customers could move to the cloud as and when they want to?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Kelly (Executives)】\nSo maybe I'll start. So I think, pretty clearly, we've done a good job of loving customers, but the reality is we know there's a lot of whitespace, Steve referenced the Excel users, and also a lot of new entrepreneurs starting businesses, and that's the target audience that we are pursuing with a product like Sage One. What we plan to do in terms of the wider question on R&D and the strategy looking ahead is actually host you back in the summer and give you a view of the strategy. But Steve, do you want to -- you got the data in front of you now?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Hare (Executives)】\nYes, so Sage One, actually, we've got just under 3,000 of our 86,000 in Sage One Extra.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Kelly (Executives)】\nOkay here, Milan?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Milan Radia (Analysts)】\nMilan Radia from Jefferies. First on X3, I guess it continues to attract less attention than Sage One and Sage One Extra as we see it today. Where have you got to now in terms of the number of partners, the average deployment value there? And where could X3 be in, say, 3 years' time as a proportion of revenue? And then on the cloud kind of competitive landscape, we've seen NetSuite and others, obviously, emphasize their European expansion plans. Witnessed your own war of words with one of those companies on Twitter. Are you doing enough to establish your cloud potentials in territories such as Germany? I mean, we heard a little bit about France and the U.K. but not much discussion around some of those other European countries where the competitors are obviously laying out some infrastructure.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Kelly (Executives)】\nOkay, maybe double-head, I'll start and then pass to you. So I think it's interesting, everybody gets very excited about cloud. The opportunity on the revenue side as well is in the mid-market, and we got great credentials there with the X3 product line. So I won't break this out probably every time we get together, but for this occasion, last year, we won 561 new customers with the X3 product line. Interesting enough, as you mentioned one of the companies, well, we always welcome competition, and it's good for the market, good for customers, good for us to innovate our products, so we always welcome lots of healthy competition. And we saw lots of that first [ph] in the Financial Times and welcome companies investing in British advertising. So that's always something we relish. Now the reality, though, is, say, take the U.K. as a microcosm. On the X3 product line, we will -- we had a win rate of 66% of sales campaigns we're involved in. And that particular company was seen on less than a handful of transactions. And the -- actually, again, the reality of all these things is the customer, so the customer feedback on those where we had a really high win rate was 3 reasons why they choose Sage X3: one is functionality is superior; secondly, a big reason, our total cost of ownership being less; and the third reason actually plays straight into our core strength, particularly in Europe, is around local support. They really value local support from local-language people basically down the road or on the phone. And they were the kind of things that resonated strongly. But I would say we sit here and think that's actually an opportunity for probably better execution. And certainly, as a global product, we've had some success. We've highlighted the soft spot in terms of France. We've made some management changes around there, and I think we've certainly got our arms around what needs to be fixed there. Steve, do you want to add on that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Hare (Executives)】\nYes, and we have -- at the year-end, we had a -- we got about 4,800 customers for X3, and we've got about 290 business partners.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Milan Radia (Analysts)】\nIn terms of where that revenue could get to over, say, 3 years?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Kelly (Executives)】\nI don't give guidance, but that's a great question for the summer, great question for the summer and something in our minds for the next few months. Go [indiscernible], yes, then we'll just go back.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Amit Harchandani (Analysts)】\nAmit Harchandani from Citigroup. Just one question in terms of your outlook or guidance for 2015, come across as fairly confident about achieving the same on the top line. If you could just elaborate a bit more on the various drivers that underpin this particular level of confidence. Is this the recurring revenue performance in Europe? Is it the stabilization in North America and the potential improvements? If you could maybe just drill down which drivers you expect to remain stable? And where do you expect more confidence to come through the course of the next 12 months?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Hare (Executives)】\nYes, I think one of the critical ingredients is Europe. If you look back over the last sort of 3 years, most people's skepticism around the growth trajectory of Sage was around whether Europe as a whole would be a continuing drag on that growth, and could we really grow Europe at something around the 6% mark. I think the fact that we've achieved 7% recurring revenue growth in Europe is pretty significant. We have very strong growth in both U.K. and France, which are the 2 biggest countries. We have a lot of momentum around subscription in both of those countries. And also, although I'm a bit cautious in the first half, I think the opportunity for recovery in mid-market Europe could be a significant part and also the building block. And we see North America, which has had -- 4% growth this year was okay, but we can see reasons why that will bump up a bit next year. So I think if you take AAMEA -- and Brazil is relatively small. But if you take AAMEA and Brazil, it's continuing to be kind of the cornerstones, contributors that they've been in the past, and then both Europe and North America continue with some of the trajectory that we can currently see, you get to 6%.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Kelly (Executives)】\nDo you want to try? Into the middle we move.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mohammed Moawalla (Analysts)】\nIt's Mohammed Moawalla from Goldman Sachs. Stephen, can you talk a bit about the product portfolio? You talked about the feedback from the customers. You also kind of touched on the kind of the big R&D base you have. Is there room to kind of further accelerate or simplify the product range as you look forward, particularly as you move to these kind of multi-geography cloud products? And is that sort of a big -- how big of a lever this could be on kind of the longer-term margin? And then secondly, just to follow up on the payments business in North America, can you just drill a bit, Steve, on the -- is this a competitive issue or an execution issue? And you alluded to kind of a -- still a tough first half next year, but what the kind of the medium-term outlook for that business is?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Kelly (Executives)】\nOkay, maybe I'll take the first and then the second. So I guess many of you know Steve and myself, and I think the opportunity that we have with 2,000 engineers around spreading the 1-face message and taking forward the 2012 strategy. So that -- what that said is product rationalization, shift the investments towards invest in growth and, obviously, exploit the opportunities in disruption in the cloud, and it's kind of our job as the management to ensure that we accelerate that. So the answer is obviously yes. Could we do better? Yes, no doubt about it. There's always -- any business of our scale, there's areas we can do better and improve on. So in terms of where I'd see -- a bit of a sneak preview into the summer, when we'd love to get you back together and lift our eyes to the next few years of how we can build global products. So essentially, when I -- from the U.S., from the German visits, broadly, payroll is probably more country specific; but generally, 60% to 70% global requirements; and then the regulatory local requirements are the additional 30%. In some of the core accounting products, it's probably 80%. So that sort of tells me strategies around Sage One and these global products we're driving in X3 absolutely means that we've got an excellent position. And actually, ironically, being a European company and understanding the complexity of the countries around Europe and the different regulatory environment and the compliance requirement, probably they're quite a significant advantage to us. So then it all comes back to better execution. And what we'd love to do again maybe around that, make some progress over the next few months, but in reality, come back to you in the summer and lift our eyes up about the opportunity going forward. Do you want to talk to the payments business initiative?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Hare (Executives)】\nYes, I mean, the payments business is -- for FY '14 was essentially flat. And some of that market, I think, a number of players, including Intuit, have pointed to the market being a bit more competitive and pricing being tough. But I do think also we've had some execution issues in terms of how we've gone about addressing the market. We did lose one of our channel partners, which also had an impact on the numbers this year. And I think with some of the actions that we've taken, there's reasons why we'll start to see that recovery and that business returning to growth. But the reason I'm cautious is the same reason I'm cautious in mid-market. When businesses are turning, I've just seen it so many times before, where the pipeline starts to fill, but the time it takes to really start to convert that pipeline and really start to see the traction returning to the business, I'm always a bit cautious about how long that's going to take. Now hopefully, I'll be positively surprised, but I'm the CFO, so I'm paid to be cautious.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Kelly (Executives)】\nIt's good to be a bit cautious. And on some of these things, we don't want to get ahead of ourselves. Steve's been here less than a year. I've been here 21 working days. So today was all about good results, reaffirmation of guidance, and then pointing us to the summer, where we'll lift our eyes and answer a lot of these questions that are on your minds. Maybe one more question. Can I go to the phones first, though? And we got a question, so hopefully be the voice of God.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gerardus Vos (Analysts)】\nTwo, if I may. First, on the kind of future kind of growth, if you look on Sage over the last kind of cycle or so, support growth has always been relatively decent but SSRS remained weak, and again, that was the case in the second half and then for the full year. When do you think that will kind of come back to kind of growth? And what kind of growth would you expect this to deliver over the kind of cycle? And then secondly, coming back on the payment business, the large proportion, I believe, is in the U.S., where you're competing with larger players, and that market is simply commoditized and so it's probably tough for you guys to find ever there a significant kind of growth. So my question on the U.S. there is, would you double up there to kind of gain the kind of scale you need? Or is this potentially something you need to kind of build down? And then in Europe, where there was more growth, still a very fragmented industry, but again, Sage Pay is relatively small. So again there, a similar kind of question, do you need to consider acquisitions there to accelerate the kind of growth?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Kelly (Executives)】\nSteve, do you want to?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Hare (Executives)】\nYes. So if you take -- if we take the revenue growth question first, we don't really expect to see SSRS return to growth as part of the plans of achieving the 6% organic growth. And that's really -- the only exception to that would be that we will start to see some -- potentially, some greater impact from mid-market and all the -- and mid-market is more likely to be license than it is subscription just because of the nature of the way that market's working. But the reason we don't expect to see strong SSRS growth is because we're driving subscription. So SSRS is largely driven by license fees, which are getting replaced by subscription. From time to time, we'll see some pickup because of mid-market and also because of professional services. But if you take the trend over a long period of time, we're not expecting to see SSRS growth. On payments, I guess 2 parts to that or 2 parts to the answer. The first is with all the payments businesses, part of the reason we own payments businesses is cross sell. So whilst the market is more competitive, we also have a compelling story to our existing installed base about integrating payments into the offering. And as I said earlier, the penetration of that cross sell, although it's greater in North America than it is in Europe, there still remains a significant opportunity and a significant advantage to our customers for offering them integrated solutions including payments. On the acquisition side, I guess I would see payments very similar to the rest of the business in that the right bolt-on acquisitions might well be appropriate for payments, just like they might well be appropriate for the rest of the business. But at the moment, we're not singling out payments in any way to say that, that -- there's more of a strategic imperative in payments than it is anywhere else. It may be, but it's not something that's a sort of burning platform that we feel we need to action in order to be successful.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Kelly (Executives)】\nGood, Steve. And we'd love to take lots more of your questions, but I think the last one today is in the middle.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Neil Steer (Analysts)】\nNeil Steer, Redburn. In fact, I think, Steve, you partially answered this question, but it was during the presentation, you referred to the integration of the most recent acquisition. Obviously, integration and leverage from M&A activities is not something we're sort of accustomed to seeing in the past from Sage. Now the question was really, what are you doing different in terms of integrating that business now that we perhaps wouldn't have seen under the previous management team?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Hare (Executives)】\nWell, I think I'd refer to Stephen's comments around one Sage. I think in the past, Sage was perhaps organized, or historically -- this has slightly changed over time. But originally, it was organized really as -- almost as a series of individual businesses, so very independent businesses. So when an acquisition took place, apart from the -- that business joining the family, it largely continued to operate in a similar or even the same way as it did before we bought it. When we buy now, it will be because we see synergies. We're not going to buy -- we're going to acquire things to acquire revenue and just leave it standalone. We will buy things because either, from a technology perspective, we think we can integrate into our existing suite of products and services to sell to a wider customer base, or it'll be because we want to acquire customers which we then cross-sell our existing products into as well. So the -- PayChoice is a good example of that. The reason why we bought PayChoice is because they have a SaaS payroll product, and so there's a 2-way opportunity. We acquire both technology and customers. The customers we acquire, we will, over time, be introducing them to the wider suite of Sage products. But also, we want the payroll SaaS platform to sell into our existing installed base. So there are clear synergies, and that's the type of deal that you're likely to see us doing in the future. It's important that there's synergistic value.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Neil Steer (Analysts)】\nAnd just be clear, that's international transfer [indiscernible]?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Hare (Executives)】\nYes, actually, in the case of PayChoice for the time being, it's a U.S. solution. It could be that we build on that, but we already -- the reason we did it in the U.S. was because we didn't have a U.S. payroll product, really, whereas we do in Europe.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Kelly (Executives)】\nThat's great. Thank you very much for your attention and support. And also, I just want to say thanks to Guy and the existing management team for a good set of results. And our commitment, Steve and I as the management team, and the board, is to absolutely assure everybody here we're very committed to short-, medium- and long-term success to our investor community, our great investors, and to deliver excellent returns from Sage.

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you. Good morning to all the participants in this webcast conference call regarding Inditex's results for the interim 9 months 2014. I am Pablo Isla, and here with me today are Ignacio Fernández, our CFO; and Marcos López, Capital Markets Director.\r\nThe results for the interim 9 months 2014 show that Inditex continues its global multi-concept, multichannel growth. We enjoy a global sales platform that fully integrates stores and online, and offers huge growth opportunities. \r\nInditex's operating performance in the period has been strong. The store and online sales in local currencies have grown 10.5%. Our operations have also shown high efficiency and tight operating control over the period.\r\nLet me also tell you that in terms of expansion, our space growth and online launches for the year are on track. In terms of growth, we have maintained a strong base of expansion. We have opened stores in 50 different markets over the period, demonstrating the global reach of Inditex's business model. We have continued our global online rollout and added Mexico and South Korea to our sales platform. \r\nWe have a global presence and have started diversifying our operations over the period. We continue to see significant growth opportunities for Inditex globally. \r\nThe year, so far, has been marked by very strong activity on many fronts. I would like to cover a number of recent initiatives carried out by Inditex. Leveraging on Inditex's presence in China with 450 stores and online sales, Zara launched Tmall on the 14th of October with a very strong reception. \r\nBershka has launched a new image. This is reflected in flagship stores in Geneva and Torino. Massimo Dutti has opened a 1,800 square meter flagship store at Serrano in Madrid with a new store image. Pull&Bear has also launched a new image that can be seen in its flagship store at Dresden, and will be extended to all new stores.\r\nStradivarius has recently launched a flagship store of 1,200 square meters in Osaka, Japan. This is Stradivarius' 900th store. Stradivarius has also launched in the United Kingdom with a store at London's Stratford City. \r\nOysho continues promoting yoga and sports events. The last notable date was Oysho's Yoga Day in Dubai, with a huge level of participation. \r\nZara Home continues its global expansion with its recent launches in South Korea and Hungary. Uterqüe has launched a special collection for the holiday season. \r\nLet me now hand over to Ignacio who will present some of the key aspects of our financial performance, and I will join you later for the outlook section.\n\n---\n\nThank you. In the interim 9 months 2014, Inditex achieved net sales of EUR 12.7 billion, EBITDA of EUR 2.8 billion and net income of EUR 1.7 billion. Inditex has had a strong operating performance. As you can see from our financial release, currency translation, due to the strong euro versus several currencies, has been a feature of the period.\r\nStarting with sales, I would like to tell you that Inditex performance in the period has been satisfactory. Store and online sales in local currencies have grown 10.5%. Like-for-like sales growth has been strong. Store and online launches for the year are on track.\r\nGross profit has increased 5% to EUR 7.5 billion, resulting in a 58.9% gross margin on sales. We have sustained our commercial policies over the period.\r\nThe change in the accounting method for Tempe from proportional consolidation to the equity method according to the new IFRS rule highlighted earlier this year, have reduced Inditex's gross margin by 40 basis points in the interim 9 months 2014; this a presentational issue with no impact on net income. Operating expenses are tightly under control. They have grown 7%, reflecting major growth in space and include the start-up costs for new openings.\r\nOperating and working capital remains negative as a result of the business model. The working capital evolution is in line with the performance of the business.\r\nI will now hand over to Marcos, who will elaborate on the performance of Inditex concepts.\n\n---\n\nIn terms of space addition and online launches, we are on track. Continuing with our global expansion, we have opened stores in 50 markets over the period. Global online launches have continued at a very rapid pace. Regarding the performance by concept in the interim 9 months 2014, Zara continues to represent approximately 2/3 of group sales; the younger concepts, around 1/3.\r\nThe younger concepts grouped together have performed satisfactorily. I would like to highlight that Oysho, Stradivarius and Zara Home have performed very strongly. And finally, I would like to mention that Uterqüe has achieved very strong like-for-like sales growth in the period. \r\nI will now hand over to Pablo for the outlook section.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Marcos. With respect to expansion in 2014, let me highlight that space growth and online launches are on track. Ordinary capital expenditures for 2014 will be around EUR 1.35 billion.\r\nFor the coming years, we continue to see strong growth opportunities, with capital expenditure growing below space growth. Regarding the outlook for the second half of 2014, I would like to add that store and online sales in local currencies from the 1st of November to the 8th of December have grown by 14%.\r\nJust as a reminder, we made our final 2013 dividend payment of EUR 754 million on the 3rd of November. We will continue to invest in the expansion of our business across a number of markets, all of which offer attractive long-term returns through our sales platform that fully integrates stores and online.\r\nInditex is present on 5 continents and in all the key markets, demonstrating the group's global reach. We manage a diversified sales platform in 88 markets. The current base offers huge growth potential for the coming years.\r\nInditex enjoys a fully integrated, globally scalable sales platform that includes stores and online. Our online operation fits perfectly with our business model. This has allowed rapid growth of our online presence in conjunction with our retail expansion. We have established online sales in Europe, the United States, China, the Russian Federation, Japan and Canada, the world's main economies. In recent months, we have launched online sales in Mexico and South Korea. We will continue rolling out online sales in selected markets to enhance our global presence.\r\nAs I mentioned during the introduction, we have initiated a third phase of expansion in China. With our already strong store and online presence, we have recently launched Zara, Bershka, Massimo Dutti, Pull&Bear and Oysho stores in Tmall, further deepening our presence in this market. \r\nBefore closing, I would like to highlight some selected Zara store openings from recent months. I would like to begin with the global flagship that Zara has opened in Shanghai on the 29th of November. Zara at East Nanjing Road occupies 3,000 square meters of retail space in this unique location, and is one of our most emblematic stores worldwide.\r\nZara has recently opened a flagship store in Roma Est. The flagship at Rynek in Kraków carries Zara's new image in an historic building. Our new flagship store at Liverpool One has been extremely well received. Zara has introduced a new image in its flagship in Helsinki at the Itakeskus center. The flagship store in Mamilla Boulevard is situated in one of the most emblematic locations of Jerusalem. We have opened another key store in Los Angeles at Los Cerritos. \r\nWe have opened a flagship store of 3,000 square meters in the most relevant retail hub of downtown Tianjin. Two important flagships have been opened in Seoul recently, consolidating our strong presence in South Korea; the first one at World Mall and the second one at Coex Mall. \r\nZara has opened a flagship store at Grand Indonesia mall in Jakarta. We also continue to grow in South Africa, with highly prominent stores like Zara at Tyger Valley in Cape Town, and Walmer Park in Port Elizabeth. \r\nTo conclude, I would like to talk about 2 very important openings in Australia, Zara Westfield in Sydney and Zara's flagship store in Murray Street in Perth. \r\nFinally, regarding our corporate calendar, the full year results for 2014 will be released on the 18th of March 2015. \r\nAnd this is all from us. We will be pleased to answer any questions you may have.",

We will be pleased to answer any questions you may have.",
      "transcript_text3": "My question is about currency translation. What is your guidance for the full year now, please? And also, what would be your gross margin guidance for the full year?\n\n---\n\nWell, yes, regarding currency translation, what we can confirm to you is the guidance that we already gave, that it's around 3 points of currency impact in the full year. In terms of gross margin, what we can tell you is that, as we anticipated during September and excluding the impact from Tempe, which is a presentational issue with no impact on net income, we expect a broadly stable gross margin in the second half.\n\n---\n\nMy question is about your market share in various markets. I think some years ago, you commented that your market share was only above 1% in 3 markets, which I'm assuming was Spain, Portugal and Greece. Have you got a similar figure for today, how many markets that you have a share of over 1%, just so we can gauge your growth in various territories?\n\n---\n\nNo, not big changes from that point of view. You know that our sector is a very fragmented sector in most of the markets, and what we can tell you is that in most of the markets, our market share is below 1% or below 1.5%. So no, no significant change from that point of view.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And in terms of online sales, there was some recent press comment that your online sales were about 3% of your total group sales. But I guess we shouldn't believe everything that we read in the press. Is that a misleading figure? Or would you like to make any comment on that?\n\n---\n\nWell, what I would say is that we are very happy with the evolution of our online activity. I -- we prefer not to talk about our online activity as a separate activity because what we believe is in how strong is this global approach with the stores and online. We continue developing our online business. We continue being very active from every point of view. You have seen that we have recently launched in Mexico and South Korea, then we have this activity, new launches in Tmall in China. So we continue being very active from this point of view. I think in previous calls, we were talking about the different online stock rooms that we are developing in the different markets. So fully integrated activity with our stores and we prefer not to elaborate very much on this or that figure, this or that percentage over total sales.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Have you opened any more online stock rooms in the period?\n\n---\n\nNo, not in this period. No, no, no.\n\n---\n\nJust a quick one on your like-for-like acceleration into the fourth quarter, which is excellent. I mean, given your currency guidance of minus 3 for the full year, that would imply for the Q4 broadly no currency impact. So is it fair to say that your run rates on like-for-likes are closer to 6% so far into Q4?\n\n---\n\nWell, you know that we prefer not to elaborate very much about the evolution of sales in a very short period of time. We always prefer to focus on the full year or at least on the season. What we can tell you is that we are happy with the evolution of our sales. We have positive like-for-likes in all the different geographies, so a good evolution of sales. And coming back to your question about currency impact, we prefer also to talk about the full year. So in the full year, as I was mentioning to you, we are expecting a 3-point impact coming from currencies, and we prefer not to elaborate very much on a very short period of time.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Maybe just following up then very quickly, just lastly on Russia, what kind of sales trends are you seeing there at the moment? And any changes in your plans for rollout?\n\n---\n\nIf -- our business continues to develop in, I would say, quite a satisfactory way, so no big changes from the point of view of our strategy or our approach to the market.\n\n---\n\nA couple of questions, please. Firstly, in terms of the current trading, is that relatively balanced across the whole period or did you see a peak when the weather sort of turned and then it sort of smoothed out?\n\n---\n\nWell, Rebecca, as you know, we prefer not to analyze just a short period of time. What we can tell you is that we believe 14% is still -- on online sales in local currencies, is a very satisfactory number. But we prefer to focus on the whole of the autumn-winter season, right? But as Pablo has anticipated, we're seeing positive like-for-likes in all the geographies. I think it's much more about the quality of the trading update, not just the specific impact in 1 single geography or 1 single period of time or over 6 weeks.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And my second question is about the Dark [ph] store, and now you've got your sort of 10 established Dark [ph] stores, are you seeing that's having a benefit in terms of the cost of delivery? And if so, is that being reinvested in delivery for certain times or are you sort of just keeping that in the margin or...\n\n---\n\nYou're referring to the Dark [ph] stores for online?\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nWell, I think that we have a very natural way of growing our online business, fully integrated with our stores. The Dark [ph] stores are no different to the stockroom of any store. They do not increase costs in any significant manner as it's a third-party operation. So this is why we have been able to grow online at such a pace now present in 27 markets, in all the key ones. We're talking about the United States, all of Europe, Russian Federation, China, Japan, South Korea, Mexico; now a presence in Tmall and thinking of expanding our online business, but without any serious implication in terms of operating expenses.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And so just 1 final one maybe. In comparison to the 40 bps Tempe impact in the third quarter gross margin, what do you think the impact should be for the fourth quarter?\n\n---\n\nWell, again, I prefer to talk about the whole year, and I think we've mentioned in our financial release that we see something very similar for the 12 months of 40 basis points even to this fact. There is 1 explanation to this. As you know, the Tempe is highly seasonal in terms of product, and this is why the impact is more second-half weighted. But again, it's 40 basis points for the whole year, what we expect at this stage.\n\n---\n\nSo Tempe should have a similar impact in the fourth quarter as the third, is that right?\n\n---\n\nI said 40 basis points for the whole year.\n\n---\n\nMy question on the Black Friday event, just to confirm if this event was worldwide? And what was the impact on sales for the first weeks of Q4? Or if you don't want to precise the impact on Black Friday's sales, if you can confirm if you expect to maintain sales in local currency at 14% in the full quarter.\n\n---\n\nWell, the impact of Black Friday was not very relevant. I would say that we're talking about the full priced sales and the stability of prices. It's a key component of what is a commercial proposition. So what I would like to talk is about the quality of this 14% sales growth.\n\n---\n\nA question on your level of inventory, which stands a little higher year-on-year than sales growth over these last 2 quarters. What are the reasons for that? And how do you intend to address that if needed? And a small one on raw materials, where you should start benefiting from a headwind. Could you help us understanding the dynamics of the raw materials decline on your gross margin?\n\n---\n\nThank you. Well, in terms of inventories, you know that as we always say, the inventory is just a snapshot of our position in 1 particular day. We pay much more attention about -- to the level of purchases that are committed at any point in time. And this commitment, what we call internally commitment, is totally in line with a normal situation. In fact, in terms of inventory, if you analyze on a 2 years' basis, the growth is 13%, which is very much in line with store sales that -- as we were anticipating to you with the trading update. So there's nothing relevant from that point of view. And in terms of raw materials, you know that we always say that the gross margin is a combination of many different things and it's very difficult to isolate one of the things that is involved in the gross margin. It has to do with markups, it has to do with markdowns, it has to do with fashion trends, it has to do, of course, with raw materials, with currencies, with many different things. So we always prefer not to enter into any particular element of the gross margin as to try to quantify it or anything like that.\n\n---\n\nIt's a follow-up question regarding your trading update for the Q4. If you can comment a little bit, please, about the effect of the new commercial initiatives that are taking place in November like the Singles' Day, the Black Friday and Cyber Monday on the sales evolution during the first weeks of the Q4, and also on the gross margin, if you can comment a little bit on that.\n\n---\n\nWell, you know that Marcos was explaining before that, first of all, what we can say -- we never like to elaborate very much on a very short period of time in terms of sales evolution. What we can tell you is that we are satisfied with the evolution of our sales. We have positive like-for-likes in all the geographies, and we prefer not to elaborate very much in a very short period of time. We always like to analyze our business on a full year basis or at least on a full-season basis. And this is our approach to the business, much more than to enter into the details of a very short period of time. And regarding the gross margin, I can tell you what I was anticipating to you before, that for the second half, excluding the Tempe impact, we are expecting a broadly stable gross margin.\n\n---\n\nJust a couple of very quick ones. The first one, just with Tmall now launching, I was just wondering if you could just confirm on some of the logistics around that: so where the stock's held, how that is kind of fulfilled through to the customers, where orders are placed? Is Tmall anything more than just a place where your website sits to you? And then secondly also, around online, just if there's any trends on the basket size that you're seeing either specifically through Tmall or just more broadly across the group.\n\n---\n\nWell, what I can tell you is that what we see with our experience in Tmall is that it's very complementary to our normal online business in China through our webpage. And in terms of logistics, it's very similar because there is nothing particularly different from that point of view. We are happy with the evolution. We are seeing coverage also in other areas of China, more coverage. So we think it's -- this approach is very strong, combining store openings, relevant store openings. We were mentioning during the presentation this very, very significant flagship that we have recently opened in Shanghai; also of course, the one in Tianjin. The one in Tianjin is unbelievable. You cannot imagine how beautiful is this store and how beautiful is the building. And also, of course, the one in Shanghai is something that deserves a visit. There is no doubt. It's an impressive flagship in the best part of what I would consider probably the most relevant street in the whole China. So it's a very, very significant flagship. So our approach to the business in China, we think, is very strong with this combination, between store openings, online and then this addition of Tmall. So we feel very, very happy about the evolution of our business in China, and we see a strong growth potential. And globally, from the point of view of online, you were also asking about the basket size. There are not big changes from that point of view in the different markets. As we have mentioned before, the average basket size is above the average basket size in the store. And we'll continue with this fully integrated approach, the stores and online. And so a very healthy evolution of the business, I would say.\n\n---\n\nI have a question. Can you tell us about your transport contracts and, specifically, how long-term are they? Or in other words, at what point might you see some benefit in your costs from falling oil prices? And then, I know I'm supposed to only ask 1, but just a second on capital intensity, and you mentioned CapEx growing slower than space growth. Can you give us some idea of where you think CapEx as a percentage of sales should end up?\n\n---\n\nWell, just in terms of our transport contracts, what I can tell you is that they are very flexible. So they are very, very flexible, and so we have long-term relationships with our suppliers of transport. We have long-term relationship but, at the same time, very flexibility contracts, particularly when you are talking about a cost that is given, which is the oil price. So very flexible contracts from that point of view. And in terms of your second question, what we are saying is that as far as we have gone in the last few years through significant logistic investments, particularly because of that, what we are seeing in the coming years is CapEx growth to be below space growth. Space growth, we are seeing between 8% to 10% and CapEx growth should be below space growth. The main driver, of course, of CapEx will continue being space growth. Then we have refurbishments and then we have logistics and IT. I'm talking about logistics now at a more, I would say, normal level, after 2 or 3 years, in which we have gone through significant logistics investment. That is why we are saying that in the future, we should expect ordinary CapEx growth to be below space growth.\n\n---\n\nThank you. The first question from the webcast platform is about Spain. Your sales growth was very strong in the first half of 2014 in Spain. Has this strong performance continued over the third quarter?\n\n---\n\nYes. We continue to enjoy positive evolution of our sales in the Spanish market, as we were mentioning in the first half results presentation. And in fact, about the Spanish market, what I would also like to highlight is that we have created 1,500 jobs in the Spanish market in the last 12 months, which is also a very relevant figure.\n\n---\n\nOkay. We've had a number of questions that I think have been covered during the Q&A session, so I'd say that the final question from the webcast platform is regarding the United States. In recent presentations, you have mentioned that you have opened a number of flagship stores in the U.S. Does this mean that you're giving greater emphasis to this market?\n\n---\n\nWhat we can tell you is that in the U.S., we are enjoying a strong growth. We use a combination of very relevant openings and online. And this is our approach. This is going to continue being our approach to the market. As we have mentioned before, we have recently opened flagship stores in Seattle, in Figueroa street. In this presentation, we were mentioning Los Cerritos; Lincoln Road in Miami. Something with -- we are also going through enlargement of some existing stores now. We are in the process, for example, of the -- of enlarging our store at 500 Fifth Avenue, this is a pitch with 42nd Street. This is going to be an unbelievable store we are planning to open in the month of March. It's going to be a huge flagship, 3,000 square meters. So we'll continue with this approach. Also in the coming months, we will open at the Financial District at 222 Broadway. So this combination between store openings and online with, I would say, quite a warm reception from our customers there.\n\n---\n\nOkay. That covers all the questions from the webcast.\n\n---\n\nWell, thank you very much. And in any case, as always and as you know, we will continue answering any questions that you may have through our Capital Markets team. Thank you very much for joining us today.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Anne Critchlow (Analysts)】\nMy question is about currency translation. What is your guidance for the full year now, please? And also, what would be your gross margin guidance for the full year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nWell, yes, regarding currency translation, what we can confirm to you is the guidance that we already gave, that it's around 3 points of currency impact in the full year. In terms of gross margin, what we can tell you is that, as we anticipated during September and excluding the impact from Tempe, which is a presentational issue with no impact on net income, we expect a broadly stable gross margin in the second half.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Hughes (Analysts)】\nMy question is about your market share in various markets. I think some years ago, you commented that your market share was only above 1% in 3 markets, which I'm assuming was Spain, Portugal and Greece. Have you got a similar figure for today, how many markets that you have a share of over 1%, just so we can gauge your growth in various territories?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nNo, not big changes from that point of view. You know that our sector is a very fragmented sector in most of the markets, and what we can tell you is that in most of the markets, our market share is below 1% or below 1.5%. So no, no significant change from that point of view.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Hughes (Analysts)】\nOkay. And in terms of online sales, there was some recent press comment that your online sales were about 3% of your total group sales. But I guess we shouldn't believe everything that we read in the press. Is that a misleading figure? Or would you like to make any comment on that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nWell, what I would say is that we are very happy with the evolution of our online activity. I -- we prefer not to talk about our online activity as a separate activity because what we believe is in how strong is this global approach with the stores and online. We continue developing our online business. We continue being very active from every point of view. You have seen that we have recently launched in Mexico and South Korea, then we have this activity, new launches in Tmall in China. So we continue being very active from this point of view. I think in previous calls, we were talking about the different online stock rooms that we are developing in the different markets. So fully integrated activity with our stores and we prefer not to elaborate very much on this or that figure, this or that percentage over total sales.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Hughes (Analysts)】\nOkay. Have you opened any more online stock rooms in the period?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nNo, not in this period. No, no, no.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Steegers (Analysts)】\nJust a quick one on your like-for-like acceleration into the fourth quarter, which is excellent. I mean, given your currency guidance of minus 3 for the full year, that would imply for the Q4 broadly no currency impact. So is it fair to say that your run rates on like-for-likes are closer to 6% so far into Q4?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nWell, you know that we prefer not to elaborate very much about the evolution of sales in a very short period of time. We always prefer to focus on the full year or at least on the season. What we can tell you is that we are happy with the evolution of our sales. We have positive like-for-likes in all the different geographies, so a good evolution of sales. And coming back to your question about currency impact, we prefer also to talk about the full year. So in the full year, as I was mentioning to you, we are expecting a 3-point impact coming from currencies, and we prefer not to elaborate very much on a very short period of time.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Steegers (Analysts)】\nOkay. Maybe just following up then very quickly, just lastly on Russia, what kind of sales trends are you seeing there at the moment? And any changes in your plans for rollout?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nIf -- our business continues to develop in, I would say, quite a satisfactory way, so no big changes from the point of view of our strategy or our approach to the market.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rebecca McClellan (Analysts)】\nA couple of questions, please. Firstly, in terms of the current trading, is that relatively balanced across the whole period or did you see a peak when the weather sort of turned and then it sort of smoothed out?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Marcos García (Executives)】\nWell, Rebecca, as you know, we prefer not to analyze just a short period of time. What we can tell you is that we believe 14% is still -- on online sales in local currencies, is a very satisfactory number. But we prefer to focus on the whole of the autumn-winter season, right? But as Pablo has anticipated, we're seeing positive like-for-likes in all the geographies. I think it's much more about the quality of the trading update, not just the specific impact in 1 single geography or 1 single period of time or over 6 weeks.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rebecca McClellan (Analysts)】\nOkay. And my second question is about the Dark [ph] store, and now you've got your sort of 10 established Dark [ph] stores, are you seeing that's having a benefit in terms of the cost of delivery? And if so, is that being reinvested in delivery for certain times or are you sort of just keeping that in the margin or...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Marcos García (Executives)】\nYou're referring to the Dark [ph] stores for online?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rebecca McClellan (Analysts)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Marcos García (Executives)】\nWell, I think that we have a very natural way of growing our online business, fully integrated with our stores. The Dark [ph] stores are no different to the stockroom of any store. They do not increase costs in any significant manner as it's a third-party operation. So this is why we have been able to grow online at such a pace now present in 27 markets, in all the key ones. We're talking about the United States, all of Europe, Russian Federation, China, Japan, South Korea, Mexico; now a presence in Tmall and thinking of expanding our online business, but without any serious implication in terms of operating expenses.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rebecca McClellan (Analysts)】\nOkay. And so just 1 final one maybe. In comparison to the 40 bps Tempe impact in the third quarter gross margin, what do you think the impact should be for the fourth quarter?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Marcos García (Executives)】\nWell, again, I prefer to talk about the whole year, and I think we've mentioned in our financial release that we see something very similar for the 12 months of 40 basis points even to this fact. There is 1 explanation to this. As you know, the Tempe is highly seasonal in terms of product, and this is why the impact is more second-half weighted. But again, it's 40 basis points for the whole year, what we expect at this stage.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rebecca McClellan (Analysts)】\nSo Tempe should have a similar impact in the fourth quarter as the third, is that right?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Marcos García (Executives)】\nI said 40 basis points for the whole year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: José Rito (Analysts)】\nMy question on the Black Friday event, just to confirm if this event was worldwide? And what was the impact on sales for the first weeks of Q4? Or if you don't want to precise the impact on Black Friday's sales, if you can confirm if you expect to maintain sales in local currency at 14% in the full quarter.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Marcos García (Executives)】\nWell, the impact of Black Friday was not very relevant. I would say that we're talking about the full priced sales and the stability of prices. It's a key component of what is a commercial proposition. So what I would like to talk is about the quality of this 14% sales growth.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Cedric Lecasble (Analysts)】\nA question on your level of inventory, which stands a little higher year-on-year than sales growth over these last 2 quarters. What are the reasons for that? And how do you intend to address that if needed? And a small one on raw materials, where you should start benefiting from a headwind. Could you help us understanding the dynamics of the raw materials decline on your gross margin?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nThank you. Well, in terms of inventories, you know that as we always say, the inventory is just a snapshot of our position in 1 particular day. We pay much more attention about -- to the level of purchases that are committed at any point in time. And this commitment, what we call internally commitment, is totally in line with a normal situation. In fact, in terms of inventory, if you analyze on a 2 years' basis, the growth is 13%, which is very much in line with store sales that -- as we were anticipating to you with the trading update. So there's nothing relevant from that point of view. And in terms of raw materials, you know that we always say that the gross margin is a combination of many different things and it's very difficult to isolate one of the things that is involved in the gross margin. It has to do with markups, it has to do with markdowns, it has to do with fashion trends, it has to do, of course, with raw materials, with currencies, with many different things. So we always prefer not to enter into any particular element of the gross margin as to try to quantify it or anything like that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Isabel Carballo (Analysts)】\nIt's a follow-up question regarding your trading update for the Q4. If you can comment a little bit, please, about the effect of the new commercial initiatives that are taking place in November like the Singles' Day, the Black Friday and Cyber Monday on the sales evolution during the first weeks of the Q4, and also on the gross margin, if you can comment a little bit on that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nWell, you know that Marcos was explaining before that, first of all, what we can say -- we never like to elaborate very much on a very short period of time in terms of sales evolution. What we can tell you is that we are satisfied with the evolution of our sales. We have positive like-for-likes in all the geographies, and we prefer not to elaborate very much in a very short period of time. We always like to analyze our business on a full year basis or at least on a full-season basis. And this is our approach to the business, much more than to enter into the details of a very short period of time. And regarding the gross margin, I can tell you what I was anticipating to you before, that for the second half, excluding the Tempe impact, we are expecting a broadly stable gross margin.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Simon Bowler (Analysts)】\nJust a couple of very quick ones. The first one, just with Tmall now launching, I was just wondering if you could just confirm on some of the logistics around that: so where the stock's held, how that is kind of fulfilled through to the customers, where orders are placed? Is Tmall anything more than just a place where your website sits to you? And then secondly also, around online, just if there's any trends on the basket size that you're seeing either specifically through Tmall or just more broadly across the group.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nWell, what I can tell you is that what we see with our experience in Tmall is that it's very complementary to our normal online business in China through our webpage. And in terms of logistics, it's very similar because there is nothing particularly different from that point of view. We are happy with the evolution. We are seeing coverage also in other areas of China, more coverage. So we think it's -- this approach is very strong, combining store openings, relevant store openings. We were mentioning during the presentation this very, very significant flagship that we have recently opened in Shanghai; also of course, the one in Tianjin. The one in Tianjin is unbelievable. You cannot imagine how beautiful is this store and how beautiful is the building. And also, of course, the one in Shanghai is something that deserves a visit. There is no doubt. It's an impressive flagship in the best part of what I would consider probably the most relevant street in the whole China. So it's a very, very significant flagship. So our approach to the business in China, we think, is very strong with this combination, between store openings, online and then this addition of Tmall. So we feel very, very happy about the evolution of our business in China, and we see a strong growth potential. And globally, from the point of view of online, you were also asking about the basket size. There are not big changes from that point of view in the different markets. As we have mentioned before, the average basket size is above the average basket size in the store. And we'll continue with this fully integrated approach, the stores and online. And so a very healthy evolution of the business, I would say.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jamie Merriman (Analysts)】\nI have a question. Can you tell us about your transport contracts and, specifically, how long-term are they? Or in other words, at what point might you see some benefit in your costs from falling oil prices? And then, I know I'm supposed to only ask 1, but just a second on capital intensity, and you mentioned CapEx growing slower than space growth. Can you give us some idea of where you think CapEx as a percentage of sales should end up?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nWell, just in terms of our transport contracts, what I can tell you is that they are very flexible. So they are very, very flexible, and so we have long-term relationships with our suppliers of transport. We have long-term relationship but, at the same time, very flexibility contracts, particularly when you are talking about a cost that is given, which is the oil price. So very flexible contracts from that point of view. And in terms of your second question, what we are saying is that as far as we have gone in the last few years through significant logistic investments, particularly because of that, what we are seeing in the coming years is CapEx growth to be below space growth.

That is why we are saying that in the future, we should expect ordinary CapEx growth to be below space growth.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nThank you.

Something with -- we are also going through enlargement of some existing stores now. We are in the process, for example, of the -- of enlarging our store at 500 Fifth Avenue, this is a pitch with 42nd Street.
