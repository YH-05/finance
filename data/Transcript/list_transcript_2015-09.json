      "transcript_text1": "Good morning, and welcome to the presentation of our 2015 preliminary results.\r\nAs usual, Jonathan will take you through the group's financial performance, and I'll provide an update on the group and our businesses. After the formal presentation, we'll be available to take any questions.\r\nWe've delivered yet another year of strong performance for the group. Adjusted operating profit increased 16% to GBP 225 million, building on our consistent track record of earnings growth. Importantly, we're delivering this increasing profitability while investing in our business and maintaining our strong financial position. Our capital position strengthened further in the year, and our return on equity also continued to improve. We're, therefore, announcing today a further 9% increase in the full year dividend.\r\nOverall, the group remains well positioned to continue to deliver sustainable growth and good returns over the long term.\r\nI'll now hand over to Jonathan.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Preben, and good morning to everyone.\r\nWe're pleased to report another year of strong performance. The Banking division achieved its sixth year of double-digit profit growth, up 15% to GBP 209 million. Winterflood delivered profit of GBP 25 million despite tough trading conditions in the first half. And in Asset Management, operating profit increased to GBP 18 million. This reflects good progress in the business as well as the benefit of one-off private equity income.\r\nOverall, group operating profit increased 16% to GBP 225 million, and adjusted EPS was up 19% to 120p. As a result, our return on equity increased to 19.5%. We've increased the full year dividend by 9% to 53.5p, reflecting the strong result for the year and our commitment to sustainable dividend growth.\r\nLooking now at the income statement in more detail.\r\nRevenue increased 10% to GBP 690 million. This was driven by higher income in both Banking and Asset Management. The expense/income ratio improved slightly to 61%, and expenses increased 8% as we continue to invest in our business. Bad debt charges reduced to GBP 42 million, helping to support the strong growth in operating profit. The effective tax rate reduced to 21%, in line with the corporation tax rate for the year. And profit after tax increased 20% to GBP 175 million. These results reflect continuing operations and exclude Seydler, the German securities business which we sold in January.\r\nOur prudent funding position is a core part of our business and supports our ability to grow in all market conditions. In the year, total funding increased to GBP 7.5 billion to support loan book growth. This remains a good level of cover at over 130% of the loan book. We have a diverse funding position with access to both deposit and wholesale funding, and we maintain a prudent maturity profile where we borrow long and lend short. At the year-end, term funding covered 70% of the loan book, which is short term, with an average maturity of only 14 months.\r\nOn the asset side, the loan book and our treasury assets make up almost 90% of the balance sheet. The GBP 5.7 billion loan book remains predominantly secured, supported by our prudent and consistent underwriting criteria. And we've maintained a strong liquidity position with over GBP 1 billion of liquid assets, primarily on deposit with the Bank of England.\r\nIn recent years, our strong financial position and prudent approach to capital have allowed us to grow our loan book and, at the same time, meet increasing regulatory requirements. Our capital ratios improved further during the year. The common equity Tier 1 ratio increased to 13.7%, and the leverage ratio increased to 10.2%. This was driven by a 14% increase in Tier 1 capital, reflecting our strong profitability, whilst risk-weighted assets increased 9%, primarily reflecting loan book growth. Our capital ratios are strong and comfortably ahead of current regulatory requirements. However, capital levels across the industry remain under review by both the U.K. and international regulators. Nonetheless, we are confident that our strong capital position and prudent approach will ensure we can meet future requirements and maintain flexibility as we grow.\r\nIn Banking, we delivered another strong performance and further improvement in returns. Income was up 12% year-on-year to almost GBP 500 million. Expenses also increased 12%, reflecting higher staff and IT costs as we continue to invest in our service-led business model. As a result, the expense/income ratio was broadly stable at 50%, which is in line with our 10-year average. The bad debt charge continued to reduce, falling to GBP 42 million. Overall, this resulted in a strong profit growth of 15% to GBP 209 million and a return on equity of 27%.\r\nThe loan book was up 8.5% in the year. Most importantly, this was achieved whilst maintaining margins and with consistent underwriting. In retail, the loan book increased 8.3%. This reflects good growth in motor finance, supported by a strong car market. Premium finance also grew in the year. Commercial increased 6.1%. This was driven by asset finance, which grew 8.5%, with good levels of new business across all sectors. However, the smaller invoice finance loan book declined slightly. Property continued to grow strongly at 13%, reflecting continued good demand for residential development finance.\r\nAs you can see, all key ratios improved in the year. This reflects our disciplined approach to lending, as well as the current favorable market conditions. The net interest margin remained strong at 8.8%, reflecting our focus on maintaining margins as competition increases and helped by a slight reduction in funding costs. The bad debt ratio continued to improve, reflecting our ongoing focus on credit quality and supported by the current low interest rates environment. This resulted in an excellent return on the loan book of 3.8%.\r\nWinterflood reported GBP 25 million of profit despite difficult trading conditions in the year. Trading was affected by low risk appetite from retail investors, reduced market activity and increased volatility, particularly in the first half. Conditions in the second half improved slightly, but overall trading income reduced year-on-year, and loss days increased to 14. However, Winterflood was helped by a good result in the investment trusts business; as well as the sale of Euroclear shares, which we reported in the first half. As a result, total income was broadly stable year-on-year. Expenses were also broadly unchanged. And Winterflood maintained a solid operating margin at 26%.\r\nAnd turning finally to Asset Management, where we continue to make good progress. Income increased 13% to GBP 96 million. This was driven by good growth in investment management, which was up 15%. The revenue margin on total client assets remained broadly stable at 88 basis points. We also benefited from nonrecurring income related to our former private equity business resulting in other income of GBP 5 million. Expenses increased modestly, reflecting the predominantly fixed-cost base and operating leverage in the business. As a result, total profit increased to GBP 18 million. Excluding the one-off income, operating profit increased 35% to GBP 13 million, with an operating margin of 15%.\r\nTotal client assets were up 11% to GBP 10.8 billion. This reflects good demand for our investment management services both on a stand-alone basis and as part of our integrated wealth management offering. As a result, our total managed assets increased 16% year-on-year to GBP 8 billion. This was driven by net inflows of GBP 700 million or 10% of managed assets. We also benefited from positive market movements of almost GBP 400 million. Importantly, these managed assets now include GBP 2.7 billion in our integrated offering where we provide both investment management and advice, an increase of some 14% on last year, whereas advised assets in third-party funds were broadly stable at GBP 2.8 billion.\r\nSo overall, we're pleased with the progress we've made during the year.\r\nThank you very much, and I'll now hand you back to Preben.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Jonathan.\r\nThe strong results today demonstrate continued execution of our clear strategic priorities and the discipline and values that define Close Brothers. Our primary focus is on delivering high-quality service and using our expertise to maintain leading positions in our specialist markets. Maintaining our strong and prudent financial position is a core part of this strategy and allows us to be there for our customers in all market conditions. It also allows us to continue to invest in our business to maintain and develop our client proposition.\r\nEach of our 3 businesses is a specialist in its own niche markets, and we apply the same conservative approach and disciplined focus on returns across all of them. The evidence of this clear strategy manifests itself differently across each of our businesses. The Banking division has delivered its sixth successive year of double-digit profit growth and continued loan book growth against a backdrop of increasing competition. Winterflood has provided continuous liquidity to its clients and delivered broadly stable profitability this year despite tough trading conditions. And Asset Management continues to make good progress in its core private client proposition, with underlying profit up 35% and accelerating growth in client assets.\r\nThe success of each of these 3 businesses has ensured the group has made tremendous progress in recent years. Over the last 5 years, we've doubled our loan book from GBP 2.9 billion in 2010 to almost GBP 6 billion today. Our profits have increased at 14% per year to GBP 225 million, and our ROE has improved to over 19%. And this in turn has allowed us to grow our dividend 7% a year while, at the same time, increasing the cover from 1.6 to 2.3x.\r\nNow let's look at each of our 3 businesses, starting with Banking.\r\nOur Banking business has a highly differentiated lending model targeting niche markets that require specialist knowledge and a local presence. It's the expertise of our people in these niche markets which builds the long-term client relationships that, in turn, drive high levels of repeat business. Importantly, each business maintains local responsibility for underwriting and any impairments or workout situations that may arise. We have a long-established distribution platform with a dedicated sales force of over 500 people, as well as our network of specialist intermediaries, which includes motor dealers and insurance brokers.\r\nAs the market environment that we operate in continues to evolve, our key priorities over the coming years are, firstly, to maintain our strict focus on returns and prudent underwriting. To do this, we'll adopt the same approach that has served us well throughout previous cycles by maintaining our margins and ensuring that we continue to price risk appropriately rather than chasing growth. Secondly, we'll continue to invest in our model to both protect our strong position in existing markets but also actively seek out opportunities in new markets that fit our business model. This investment will take many forms but will include further investment in people to expand our distribution capabilities, such as our sales academy to train the next generation of sales people in our SME lending businesses; continuous investment in technology to enhance our customer experience and speed to market; and thirdly, further pilots of new products and new markets, such as our point-of-sale finance offering for specialist retailers that we shared with you earlier this year, which is progressing well.\r\nYou've all seen this chart before, but we've included it again given how relevant it is as market dynamics continue to evolve. Throughout this 30-year period, we've done what we always do: stuck to our specialist markets and maintained our robust and prudent lending model. As expected, our growth rate is moderating slightly from the exceptional levels seen in recent years, but the more important point to note is the stability of both our margins and returns over the long term. I've shown in the table these have been very stable over the last 10 years, a period which includes the full spectrum of market conditions. The chart illustrates the ability of our business model to deliver consistent growth and strong returns through periods of recession and financial stress as well as both high and low interest rate environments.\r\nAs we've said before, we continue to see a steady increase in the supply of credit and competition from both traditional and the newer banking groups, but we believe the total supply of credit in a number of our specialist markets still remains below precrisis levels. It's also important to note that we continue to see good demand for all our products. Our motor finance business is seeing robust demand due to growth in the underlying car market, and as a result, we've grown that book by close to 10% at consistently strong returns. In asset finance, we've seen good demand across all sectors and actually wrote record levels of new business last year, which helped drive the 8.5% growth in that book. And our property business delivered the highest rate of growth again last year and has a good pipeline as activity in the wider property market remains buoyant.\r\nThrough the years, we have significant experience of developing new products and entering new markets. This history of extending our business model into new areas has helped support continued growth over the long term and through previous credit cycles. To give you some perspective on these initiatives: We only entered both the Irish market and alternative energy finance market a few years ago, but we've already turned these pilots into material businesses contributing significant growth. Our Irish business currently has a GBP 300 million loan book; and offers motor, asset, premium and invoice finance in areas of the market which meet our prudent risk and return criteria. The alternative energy team are specialists in project financing for a variety of renewable technologies and have built a loan book of almost GBP 100 million. Both these businesses are now generating good profitability and have robust pipelines going forward.\r\nAs you know, we do not manage this business to a growth target. And our priority is always to maintain our strong margins, prudent underwriting and good returns. But as these slides clearly demonstrate, we're confident that our business model can deliver sustainable growth over the long term in a wide range of market conditions.\r\nNow moving on to Winterflood. As you all know, Winterflood is a market maker with a client-specific offering that combines the extensive trading experience of its staff with sophisticated IT trading systems. We're committed to providing continuous liquidity in all conditions and maintain a leading market position, and as a result, the business is exposed to wider market conditions, which were quite mixed last year.\r\nThe chart on the bottom shows the AIM market, which is a core part of Winterflood's business. Most equity markets, but particularly AIM, experienced weak and volatile conditions in the first half of the financial year. This resulted in lower levels of both primary and secondary activity, both of which improved in the second half. And as Jonathan highlighted, the investment trusts side of Winterflood's business performed particularly well last year, which helped to offset some of the headwind in trading revenues. This illustrates the overall strength and diversity of Winterflood's business model, which enables us to trade profitably in a variety of market conditions and has ensured the business delivered a solid result for the year.\r\nNow on to Asset Management. The division continued to make good progress in the last year. Total client assets were up 11% to GBP 10.8 billion. And underlying operating profit, excluding the private equity income, increased 35% to GBP 13 million. Since the year-end, we've entered into an agreement to dispose of our small corporate business to further focus on our core private client advice and wealth management offering, so the numbers on this slide relate to the underlying performance of our business excluding the corporate business. And as you can see, the core business is making good progress. Adjusted operating profit has increased to GBP 13 million in 2015. The operating profit margin was 15%, in line with our target. And the revenue margin of 95 basis points highlights the lower-margin nature of the corporate activities we've sold.\r\nIn terms of client assets, the business is delivering good growth in all areas. Managed assets grew by 18% in 2015, and assets that are both advised and managed grew by 14%. This illustrates strong demand for both our high-quality integrated advice and management proposition as well as our tailored investment management products.\r\nHere is an overview of our fully integrated solution, which is core to our private client business. This offering incorporates both advice and investment management and is designed to support clients at all stages of their financial life cycle. Our advisers help clients to build a plan designed to support their financial and lifestyle goals. And our investment managers provide clients with global, diversified investment management through a range of vehicles, which include our own funds, discretionary portfolios and a fully bespoke high-net-worth service for larger clients. And our platform technology provides clients with a consolidated picture of their wealth. This is a differentiated, high-quality and well-branded offering. And therefore, we're well positioned to benefit from the increasing demand for financial advice driven by ongoing demographic and regulatory changes as well as the U.K. government's recently announced pension reforms.\r\nIn addition to the extensive opportunities for organic growth, we'll continue to look at adding further scale and geographic presence through selected infill acquisitions and hiring, but we will, as ever, remain disciplined on price and quality.\r\nTo conclude, the group is well positioned to deliver further growth and investment. And we're confident that our strategy and proven business model will continue to deliver value for both our customers and shareholders over the long term. In Banking, we see continued opportunities for growth while maintaining our prudent risk profile and focus on returns. Winterflood is well positioned but remains sensitive to market conditions. And we expect Asset Management to continue to deliver net inflows and increasing profitability.\r\nThat now concludes the presentation, and there's just one last thing for me to do, which is to invite you to join us on the 26th of November for an investor seminar. We're planning to hold a deep dive of our Banking division, so please put that date in your diaries. And we'll send out a formal invitation in due course.\r\nWe'll now take any questions that you may have. We're also joined by our business heads. Seated in the front row, Stephen Hodges from the Banking division, Philip Yarrow from Winterflood and Martin Andrew from Asset Management will also be happy to take questions. And as usual, please state your name and company before asking a question.\r\nThank you.",

Our Irish business currently has a GBP 300 million loan book; and offers motor, asset, premium and invoice finance in areas of the market which meet our prudent risk and return criteria. The alternative energy team are specialists in project financing for a variety of renewable technologies and have built a loan book of almost GBP 100 million. Both these businesses are now generating good profitability and have robust pipelines going forward.\r\nAs you know, we do not manage this business to a growth target. And our priority is always to maintain our strong margins, prudent underwriting and good returns. But as these slides clearly demonstrate, we're confident that our business model can deliver sustainable growth over the long term in a wide range of market conditions.\r\nNow moving on to Winterflood. As you all know, Winterflood is a market maker with a client-specific offering that combines the extensive trading experience of its staff with sophisticated IT trading systems. We're committed to providing continuous liquidity in all conditions and maintain a leading market position, and as a result, the business is exposed to wider market conditions, which were quite mixed last year.\r\nThe chart on the bottom shows the AIM market, which is a core part of Winterflood's business. Most equity markets, but particularly AIM, experienced weak and volatile conditions in the first half of the financial year. This resulted in lower levels of both primary and secondary activity, both of which improved in the second half. And as Jonathan highlighted, the investment trusts side of Winterflood's business performed particularly well last year, which helped to offset some of the headwind in trading revenues. This illustrates the overall strength and diversity of Winterflood's business model, which enables us to trade profitably in a variety of market conditions and has ensured the business delivered a solid result for the year.\r\nNow on to Asset Management. The division continued to make good progress in the last year. Total client assets were up 11% to GBP 10.8 billion. And underlying operating profit, excluding the private equity income, increased 35% to GBP 13 million. Since the year-end, we've entered into an agreement to dispose of our small corporate business to further focus on our core private client advice and wealth management offering, so the numbers on this slide relate to the underlying performance of our business excluding the corporate business. And as you can see, the core business is making good progress. Adjusted operating profit has increased to GBP 13 million in 2015. The operating profit margin was 15%, in line with our target. And the revenue margin of 95 basis points highlights the lower-margin nature of the corporate activities we've sold.\r\nIn terms of client assets, the business is delivering good growth in all areas. Managed assets grew by 18% in 2015, and assets that are both advised and managed grew by 14%. This illustrates strong demand for both our high-quality integrated advice and management proposition as well as our tailored investment management products.\r\nHere is an overview of our fully integrated solution, which is core to our private client business. This offering incorporates both advice and investment management and is designed to support clients at all stages of their financial life cycle. Our advisers help clients to build a plan designed to support their financial and lifestyle goals. And our investment managers provide clients with global, diversified investment management through a range of vehicles, which include our own funds, discretionary portfolios and a fully bespoke high-net-worth service for larger clients. And our platform technology provides clients with a consolidated picture of their wealth. This is a differentiated, high-quality and well-branded offering. And therefore, we're well positioned to benefit from the increasing demand for financial advice driven by ongoing demographic and regulatory changes as well as the U.K. government's recently announced pension reforms.\r\nIn addition to the extensive opportunities for organic growth, we'll continue to look at adding further scale and geographic presence through selected infill acquisitions and hiring, but we will, as ever, remain disciplined on price and quality.\r\nTo conclude, the group is well positioned to deliver further growth and investment. And we're confident that our strategy and proven business model will continue to deliver value for both our customers and shareholders over the long term. In Banking, we see continued opportunities for growth while maintaining our prudent risk profile and focus on returns. Winterflood is well positioned but remains sensitive to market conditions. And we expect Asset Management to continue to deliver net inflows and increasing profitability.\r\nThat now concludes the presentation, and there's just one last thing for me to do, which is to invite you to join us on the 26th of November for an investor seminar. We're planning to hold a deep dive of our Banking division, so please put that date in your diaries. And we'll send out a formal invitation in due course.\r\nWe'll now take any questions that you may have. We're also joined by our business heads. Seated in the front row, Stephen Hodges from the Banking division, Philip Yarrow from Winterflood and Martin Andrew from Asset Management will also be happy to take questions. And as usual, please state your name and company before asking a question.\r\nThank you.",
      "transcript_text3": "It's Peter Lenardos from RBC. I just had a question on the bank tax surcharge and your updated thoughts on whether that will be amended in future years.\n\n---\n\nWe issued a statement, with our update on -- in July, on the estimated impact of that tax surcharge. And as that statement said, we think that, that bites in 2017. And given what is currently in scope and out of scope and the GBP 25 million current threshold, we think that will have a 5% impact on us from that time in terms of our tax rate at that time. As you know from the press, we have, along with a number of smaller banks, made representations to the treasury and made suggestions about raising that threshold or putting in a tiered threshold, and we'll have to wait and see.\n\n---\n\nIt's Philip Middleton from Merrill. Just 2 questions. Firstly, on Winterflood, you talk about the investment trusts team having had a good year. And well done to them. Could you give us some idea of the materiality of that? And was -- is that trading? Or is that corporate finance, which I know is a big component of what they do? And secondly, when you look at the wealth management business, how much of the growth comes from moving clients from one service to your deeper services? Or how much of that is pure inflow, to the differential growth rates?\n\n---\n\nOkay, Jonathan, do you want to take the investment trusts question?\n\n---\n\nYes. In terms of -- as you know, Winterflood's -- has a market-making service which covers the full U.K. list and the full European list, with some U.S. stocks as well. The bulk of it is U.K. market making. However, Winterflood also has an investment trusts business, which is both the primary and the secondary market making. And normally, Winterflood's will have about 15% to 20% of its total income coming from that investment trusts business. And because of the good performance in the second half, you can assume that, that contribution was at the 20% and slightly higher into the range rather than the more normalized 15% to 20%.\n\n---\n\nWas that secondary, primary corporate finance? Bit of both, a bit of all...\n\n---\n\nA bit of each, but there were some good new issues as well. But consistently, throughout the years, as you go back, it is nicely split between secondary and primary. There was a little bit more primary in the second half this year than we'd seen previously.\n\n---\n\nAnd in terms of the inflows or the impact, there is some impact from clients moving from advised only to advised and managed, i.e. into our products and services. We'd obviously like to see that continue, but the major impact is new clients coming into the business, as opposed to that migration.\n\n---\n\nIt's Gary at Shore Capital. According to the statement, you took some money from the Funding for Lending Scheme during the year. I just wonder if you could quantify that and the impact that it had on the margin and also whether you plan to take any more.\n\n---\n\nAbsolutely. I mean, I think the answer, Jonathan, in terms of amount is GBP 375 million. That's how much we've currently drawn down. And in terms of the whether or not we'd look to increase that, it won't be by very much. It won't be material from there. And that's a function of the assets, the nature of the assets that we have to pledge and our alternative funding sources, frankly.\n\n---\n\nAnd the benefit to the margin?\n\n---\n\nWell, I...\n\n---\n\nIt's marginal. I mean we've got GBP 7.5 billion of funding. The average cost of that is LIBOR plus 200, so if we're adding GBP 375 million for a partial year, it's a pretty small effect. And as you know, because we fund long, the impact takes time for any sort of rate changes to affect us.\n\n---\n\nIt's just a useful alternative source of funding, right, diversified...\n\n---\n\nThe way -- exactly. And we look at that as a diversifier. We also pledge our assets in securitization vehicles, so in -- to us, we look at it as almost another securitization vehicle.\n\n---\n\nJustin Bates from Liberum. Just going back to Philip's question on the Asset Management division, could you provide a bit more detail on the net inflows, i.e. the split between IFAs and direct, please?\n\n---\n\nYes, we certainly can. I mean the IFA channel is an important source of inflows for us into the managed-only side of the business. We actually benefit from that in more than simply economic ways because it's a corroboration of the quality of our investment management services. In terms of the amount that, that represented, do we have that number? Do we actually disclose that? I don't know whether we do separately.\n\n---\n\nNo, no, we don't disclose it.\n\n---\n\nWe don't break it out. Any other questions?\r\nThank you very much indeed. Thank you.",

Following the presentation, we will be answering questions that were forwarded to us beforehand by analysts via email.\r\nWe would like to remind everyone that this webcast presentation will be available on our website at http://corpo.couche-tard.com for a 90-day period. Also, please remember that some of the issues discussed during this webcast might be looking-forward statements, which are provided by the corporation with its usual caveats. These caveats or risks and uncertainties are outlined in our financial reporting. Therefore, our future results could differ from the information discussed today. \r\nI will now turn this presentation over to Mr. Brian Hannasch, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mr. Raymond Paré, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\r\nGentlemen, please go ahead.\n\n---\n\nAll right. Thanks, Christine. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for listening in on the webcast regarding Couche-Tard's first quarter of fiscal 2016. As usual, I have with me Raymond Paré, our President -- Vice President and CFO. We'll run briefly through the results and offer some background information before answering the questions you submitted earlier today. \r\nWe're very pleased to share with you our performance for the first quarter of our fiscal 2016 year. Thanks to the contributions from acquisitions, to strong organic growth and to continued rigorous cost control, our adjusted net earnings have increased by 8.3% despite materially lower fuel margins in the U.S. and Canada, which were very strong last year in a rapidly declining crude environment. \r\nOrganic growth was achieved through the continued improvements we've been making to our network and to our product offer, along with continued improvement in retail execution and growing recognition of our private label products, including our European fuel brand miles and milesplus, which continue to contribute to our growing fuel volumes, increasing sales for premium fuel grades and gaining market share while maintaining healthy margins in Europe.\r\nWe're able to increase -- to limit the increase in expenses despite the high level of activity throughout the organization and the significant top line growth, which is a nice demonstration of our company's discipline culture. \r\nAs for network growth, our teams have once again done an outstanding job. During the quarter, we acquired a total of 26 stores while we completed the construction, relocation and rebuilding of 17 new sites.\r\nDuring that same period, we also acquired 141 fuel supply agreements as well as -- fuel customer relationships with another 124 dealer sites.\r\nOn top of that, as of the end of the quarter, we had 31 sites under construction that will open in the coming quarters. These new and upcoming additions to our network should be nice contributors to our future organic growth. \r\nLast but not least, The Pantry stores are showing good results with nice same-store growth in both store sales and fuel volume. We expect further growth as key programs get implemented and the harmonization of the brands kicks off in the coming months.\r\nFurthermore, during the first quarter, we have already recorded cost reductions we estimate at approximately $9 million. We expect to realize more savings in the upcoming quarters once the opportunities we identified are fully implemented.\r\nAs of today, we've already taken actions that should allow us to reach cost reductions of approximately USD 50 million on an annual basis. And we're still very confident to reach our 80 -- target of $85 million over the 24-month period following the acquisition.\r\nNone of these numbers takes into consideration the expected savings from the reduction of cost of goods sold, mainly through the negotiation of better supply conditions and economies of scale. On this front, we've already taken actions that are expected to reduce our cost of goods by approximately $17 million on an annual basis, of which $3 million has also already been realized in this quarter.\r\nThis leaves me quite excited to see this -- how this network will perform. I look forward to sharing with you our results and achievements in the coming quarters. \r\nNow I'll let Raymond go over the numbers in more detail. Ray?\n\n---\n\nThank you, Brian. Good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased to share our first quarter results, as Brian mentioned, which once again showed that our business model was effective and allowed us to record substantial growth quarter-over-quarter organically through our strong same-store indicators, strong merchandise margin, our new stores and the successful integration of our acquisitions, all of this despite some periods of volatility in gas margin in the U.S. market compared to our steadier European and Canadian market. This highlights the benefit of a well-diversified geographic footprint and a great execution.\r\nNet earnings were $304 million for the first quarter, an increase of $34.5 million, while diluted earnings per share stood at $0.53 per share. Excluding the nonrecurring items described in our MD&A, adjusted net earnings stood at $299 million while adjusted diluted earnings per share remained unchanged at approximately $0.53 compared to $0.48 for the corresponding quarter of 2015, a strong increase of 10.4%. This increase is attributable to the contribution from The Pantry store, network and order acquisition to our continued organic growth from merchandise and service and road transportation fuel as well as our usual rigorous cost control. These items were offset in part by lower fuel margin and the strengthening of the U.S. dollars against our other functional currency and by higher income tax rate. \r\nI will quickly highlight some of our key indicators for the quarter. For a complete overview of our quarterly results, please refer to our MD&A, which is available on SEDAR.\r\nFor the first quarter, same-store merchandise sales increased by 5.1% in the United States, by 2.3% in Canada and by 1.3% in Europe. Our performance is attributable to our dynamic merchandising strategies, to our competitive offer as well as through our extended fresh food offer, which is attracting more customers in our stores.\r\nExcluding the negative impact from currency translation, our consolidated merchandise and service gross profit grew by $194.2 million, a substantial increase of 28.7%.\r\nGross margin was 33.1% in the U.S., 41.8% in Europe and 33.2% in Canada for a consolidated margin of 33.9%. The consolidated margin may be perceived as declining, but this is explained by a higher proportion of our sales coming from the U.S., where the margin percentage is lower because of a different product mix. In fact, the merchandise and service gross margin increased by 0.4% in the U.S. and by 0.2% in Europe, but it decreased by -- slightly in Canada by 0.1%.\r\nOverall, this performance reflects changes in our product mix, the improvement we brought to our supply terms as well as our merchandising strategy in line with market competitiveness and economic conditions within each market.\r\nOn the fuel side, same-store volume in the United States showed an impressive increase of 9.4%, taking into consideration The Pantry stores which used a methodology aligned with ours. Same-store volume also increased by 2.7% in Europe and by 1.4% in Canada. Overall, this performance is due, among other things, to our mark-to-market pricing strategies to improve Fuel & Retail execution as well as to the contribution of miles and milesplus, our proprietary fuel brand in Europe.\r\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we posted road transportation fuel gross margin of USD 0.1834 per gallon in the U.S., of CAD 0.0636 per liter in Canada and USD 0.0960 per liter in Europe. In Europe, the drop in fuel margin is explained by the negative impact of the foreign exchange translation into U.S. dollars. In local currencies, the fuel margin in Europe was higher than in the first quarter of fiscal 2015.\r\nAs mentioned in the past, we always look at fuel margin on a longer term than just a quarter. We are optimistic about the trend and believe that factors like the increase of premium fuel in the sales mix and other factors that equally support the trend of the last 10 years in terms of improvement of the fuel margin. The U.S. market volatility is materially decreasing, but this market is still not as stable as the Canadian and European market.\r\nOur usual rigorous cost controls throughout the organization allowed us to limit expenses -- expense increase to a minimum despite our strong top line growth, the creation of 2 new business units in the United States and the considerable efforts to power the integration of The Pantry stores. In this respect, we are still actively working on realizing cost-reduction opportunities for The Pantry network.\r\nWe're already seeing the impact of the action taken and are looking forward to see their full impact in the upcoming quarters as mentioned by Brian. \r\nExcluding nonrecurring items described in our MD&A, adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 increased by $50.4 million or 10.2%, reaching $546.6 million.\r\nOur income tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 was 23.4% compared with an income tax rate of 24.7% for the total fiscal 2015 and of 20.7% for the corresponding quarter of the previous year. The increase in the incoming -- income tax rate compared with the first quarter of 2015 was mainly driven by the impact of a higher proportion of our taxable income coming from the United States where we have our highest statutory tax rate, mainly as a consequence of the acquisition of The Pantry. \r\nDuring the first quarter, we issued Canadian dollars denominated senior unsecured notes totaling CAD 700 million as satisfactory condition and used the net proceeds to repay a portion of our term revolving unsecured operating credit facility. Consequently, our long-term debt is well spread over the next 10 years at attractive interest rates, giving us the flexibility to take advantage of any attractive opportunities.\r\nOur indebtedness ratios are solid compared within the industry other retailers. Our net interest-bearing debt on adjusted EBITDA reached 1.04 on a pro forma basis for the acquisition of The Pantry. Standard & Poor's recently recognized the strength of our credit profile by attributing a positive outlook to our BBB rating.\r\nThe -- we are beginning the new fiscal year with really good results. The Pantry stores are already showing significant improvement in terms of growth and cost efficiency. The action already taken to improve margins and reduce expenses are well underway, and we are in a good position to be able to reach our objectives. \r\nIn line with our usual approach, we'll continue to balance our debt structure and manage our cash flow efficiently in order to maintain and even improve our already solid financial position. \r\nAnd that concludes my part. Brian?\n\n---\n\nAll right. Thank you, Raymond. We're very pleased with the results of the quarter. Beyond the numbers, these types of results help inspire and motivate our teams to continue the great work as the road ahead still is full of opportunities that we will and must take advantage of. \r\nAs usual, we'll continue to look out for the right investment opportunities that come up. We're working on several promising projects of various sizes using our usual disciplined approach. We have good momentum, and we're committed to continue to build on it. \r\nWith that, thank you very much. And we'll turn it over to Christine for questions.",

During the quarter, we acquired a total of 26 stores while we completed the construction, relocation and rebuilding of 17 new sites.\r\nDuring that same period, we also acquired 141 fuel supply agreements as well as -- fuel customer relationships with another 124 dealer sites.\r\nOn top of that, as of the end of the quarter, we had 31 sites under construction that will open in the coming quarters. These new and upcoming additions to our network should be nice contributors to our future organic growth. \r\nLast but not least, The Pantry stores are showing good results with nice same-store growth in both store sales and fuel volume. We expect further growth as key programs get implemented and the harmonization of the brands kicks off in the coming months.\r\nFurthermore, during the first quarter, we have already recorded cost reductions we estimate at approximately $9 million. We expect to realize more savings in the upcoming quarters once the opportunities we identified are fully implemented.\r\nAs of today, we've already taken actions that should allow us to reach cost reductions of approximately USD 50 million on an annual basis. And we're still very confident to reach our 80 -- target of $85 million over the 24-month period following the acquisition.\r\nNone of these numbers takes into consideration the expected savings from the reduction of cost of goods sold, mainly through the negotiation of better supply conditions and economies of scale. On this front, we've already taken actions that are expected to reduce our cost of goods by approximately $17 million on an annual basis, of which $3 million has also already been realized in this quarter.\r\nThis leaves me quite excited to see this -- how this network will perform. I look forward to sharing with you our results and achievements in the coming quarters. \r\nNow I'll let Raymond go over the numbers in more detail. Ray?\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Raymond Paré (Executives)】\nThank you, Brian. Good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased to share our first quarter results, as Brian mentioned, which once again showed that our business model was effective and allowed us to record substantial growth quarter-over-quarter organically through our strong same-store indicators, strong merchandise margin, our new stores and the successful integration of our acquisitions, all of this despite some periods of volatility in gas margin in the U.S. market compared to our steadier European and Canadian market. This highlights the benefit of a well-diversified geographic footprint and a great execution.\r\nNet earnings were $304 million for the first quarter, an increase of $34.5 million, while diluted earnings per share stood at $0.53 per share. Excluding the nonrecurring items described in our MD&A, adjusted net earnings stood at $299 million while adjusted diluted earnings per share remained unchanged at approximately $0.53 compared to $0.48 for the corresponding quarter of 2015, a strong increase of 10.4%. This increase is attributable to the contribution from The Pantry store, network and order acquisition to our continued organic growth from merchandise and service and road transportation fuel as well as our usual rigorous cost control. These items were offset in part by lower fuel margin and the strengthening of the U.S. dollars against our other functional currency and by higher income tax rate. \r\nI will quickly highlight some of our key indicators for the quarter. For a complete overview of our quarterly results, please refer to our MD&A, which is available on SEDAR.\r\nFor the first quarter, same-store merchandise sales increased by 5.1% in the United States, by 2.3% in Canada and by 1.3% in Europe. Our performance is attributable to our dynamic merchandising strategies, to our competitive offer as well as through our extended fresh food offer, which is attracting more customers in our stores.\r\nExcluding the negative impact from currency translation, our consolidated merchandise and service gross profit grew by $194.2 million, a substantial increase of 28.7%.\r\nGross margin was 33.1% in the U.S., 41.8% in Europe and 33.2% in Canada for a consolidated margin of 33.9%. The consolidated margin may be perceived as declining, but this is explained by a higher proportion of our sales coming from the U.S., where the margin percentage is lower because of a different product mix. In fact, the merchandise and service gross margin increased by 0.4% in the U.S. and by 0.2% in Europe, but it decreased by -- slightly in Canada by 0.1%.\r\nOverall, this performance reflects changes in our product mix, the improvement we brought to our supply terms as well as our merchandising strategy in line with market competitiveness and economic conditions within each market.\r\nOn the fuel side, same-store volume in the United States showed an impressive increase of 9.4%, taking into consideration The Pantry stores which used a methodology aligned with ours. Same-store volume also increased by 2.7% in Europe and by 1.4% in Canada. Overall, this performance is due, among other things, to our mark-to-market pricing strategies to improve Fuel & Retail execution as well as to the contribution of miles and milesplus, our proprietary fuel brand in Europe.\r\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we posted road transportation fuel gross margin of USD 0.1834 per gallon in the U.S., of CAD 0.0636 per liter in Canada and USD 0.0960 per liter in Europe. In Europe, the drop in fuel margin is explained by the negative impact of the foreign exchange translation into U.S. dollars. In local currencies, the fuel margin in Europe was higher than in the first quarter of fiscal 2015.\r\nAs mentioned in the past, we always look at fuel margin on a longer term than just a quarter. We are optimistic about the trend and believe that factors like the increase of premium fuel in the sales mix and other factors that equally support the trend of the last 10 years in terms of improvement of the fuel margin. The U.S. market volatility is materially decreasing, but this market is still not as stable as the Canadian and European market.\r\nOur usual rigorous cost controls throughout the organization allowed us to limit expenses -- expense increase to a minimum despite our strong top line growth, the creation of 2 new business units in the United States and the considerable efforts to power the integration of The Pantry stores. In this respect, we are still actively working on realizing cost-reduction opportunities for The Pantry network.\r\nWe're already seeing the impact of the action taken and are looking forward to see their full impact in the upcoming quarters as mentioned by Brian. \r\nExcluding nonrecurring items described in our MD&A, adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 increased by $50.4 million or 10.2%, reaching $546.6 million.\r\nOur income tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 was 23.4% compared with an income tax rate of 24.7% for the total fiscal 2015 and of 20.7% for the corresponding quarter of the previous year. The increase in the incoming -- income tax rate compared with the first quarter of 2015 was mainly driven by the impact of a higher proportion of our taxable income coming from the United States where we have our highest statutory tax rate, mainly as a consequence of the acquisition of The Pantry. \r\nDuring the first quarter, we issued Canadian dollars denominated senior unsecured notes totaling CAD 700 million as satisfactory condition and used the net proceeds to repay a portion of our term revolving unsecured operating credit facility. Consequently, our long-term debt is well spread over the next 10 years at attractive interest rates, giving us the flexibility to take advantage of any attractive opportunities.\r\nOur indebtedness ratios are solid compared within the industry other retailers. Our net interest-bearing debt on adjusted EBITDA reached 1.04 on a pro forma basis for the acquisition of The Pantry. Standard & Poor's recently recognized the strength of our credit profile by attributing a positive outlook to our BBB rating.\r\nThe -- we are beginning the new fiscal year with really good results. The Pantry stores are already showing significant improvement in terms of growth and cost efficiency. The action already taken to improve margins and reduce expenses are well underway, and we are in a good position to be able to reach our objectives. \r\nIn line with our usual approach, we'll continue to balance our debt structure and manage our cash flow efficiently in order to maintain and even improve our already solid financial position. \r\nAnd that concludes my part. Brian?\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Brian Hannasch (Executives)】\nAll right. Thank you, Raymond. We're very pleased with the results of the quarter. Beyond the numbers, these types of results help inspire and motivate our teams to continue the great work as the road ahead still is full of opportunities that we will and must take advantage of. \r\nAs usual, we'll continue to look out for the right investment opportunities that come up. We're working on several promising projects of various sizes using our usual disciplined approach. We have good momentum, and we're committed to continue to build on it. \r\nWith that, thank you very much. And we'll turn it over to Christine for questions.",
      "transcript_text3": "We will now answer questions you submitted earlier today. The first questions are from Patricia Baker of Scotia Capital. Q1 results saw further solid momentum in the United States operations with another 5% increase for comparable stores and interest margins. Would we be right in assuming that this is owed in large part to the efforts around the fresh offer and bettering the mix at the discussion you provided in Q4 on the U.S. trends continue? And put simply, your U.S. business just keeps getting better.\n\n---\n\nI think that's a fair point, the last one. The U.S. continues to show nice strength. Certainly, I think globally, we're benefiting from lower fuel prices, and it's effectively a tax refund for our customers. And it's a little more in the U.S. than other markets. We're seeing them be willing to spend it. We are making good progress on the fresh and private label, so we think our offer continues to improve. We see less pressure to promote, to drive traffic than we have over the last few years. And finally, we're getting more traffic on the forecourt with our fuel offer, which creates another shopping occasion for our customers inside the box. So you add all those together, we feel good about the U.S. business and continue to think it will remain strong in the coming quarters.\n\n---\n\nSecond question. It sounds like progress with The Pantry integration is going well. Can you provide some further detail on the harmonization of the brands and how that will proceed over the coming quarters? Any key milestones?\n\n---\n\nYes. We've made no brand harmonization efforts to-date, but we have made a decision. We will be using the Circle K brand in the U.S. going forward as our convenience store brand. Work will begin in January on The Pantry network and extend over the following 6 to 9 months. We're very excited about the opportunity to combine the 2 networks in the southeast part of the U.S. We're confident that we're going to see certainly increased consumer awareness, which will drive synergies on top line as we dramatically grow our market share in the 4, 5 core Pantry states. From the fuel side, we're currently looking at our portfolio of brands that we have in place. This work is well advanced, and we'll implement our go-forward strategies in the first half of calendar 2016.\n\n---\n\nThe next set of questions are from Derek Dley from Canaccord Genuity. The first question. Can you provide some color on what drove the strength in fuel volumes in the United States? And how much of the 9.4% growth was driven by The Pantry?\n\n---\n\nSeems to be a common question. So I guess we're pleased everybody noticed the strong results. U.S. fuel results continue to be very solid in both legacy and Pantry networks. When you look at industry data, we think demand is in the 2% to 3% range, depending on what part of the country you're in. It does vary by geography. We think -- well, we believe we've outperformed those types of numbers materially on both networks, both the legacy network and The Pantry network. I would say The Pantry network was accretive to the overall results, but the base or heritage network performed very, very well and significantly outperformed what we think industry demand is. We continue to refine how we market our fuels, to optimize overall gross profit dollars. And we've improved our processes and approach over the years. But we still think there's room to get even better in how we market fuels in our network.\n\n---\n\nSecond question. Can you comment on the acquisition environment in both North America and Europe? Do you see any wide pipeline of opportunities?\n\n---\n\nI will say similar to the previous quarter and also in line with the comment that Brian made earlier, we do believe still see basically different size of opportunity, and I will say the pipeline is still basically interesting.\n\n---\n\nThe next set of questions are from Irene Nattel from RBC Capital Markets. First question. Results in the United States were particularly strong in Q1, especially gas volumes and margins. Can you talk about what you are seeing from a consumer demand perspective, both for gas and inside the store? What were the key factors behind the 9.4% same-store gas volume growth and the 5.1% merchandise same-store sales growth in the United States? This question has already been addressed in the previous response. Therefore, we're going to pass to the second question. You've had a focus on the fresh offerings and a number of tests of different approaches and offerings. Can you please provide an update on the fresh incentives across geographic -- geographies and your current thinking of how the offerings is likely to evolve?\n\n---\n\nBe happy to. So I'll start with Europe. Europe, our focus is on on-site prepared foods. We continue to perform very well there and driven by menu innovation. We'll talk about it in the following question, but real hotdogs have been launched on a good part of the network and showing good results. And then we've also launched some pastry pilots to see if we can innovate and differentiate our pastry offerings in Europe. North America, as we communicated in prior quarters, we continue down a parallel path with prepared on-site being done in several hundred stores with most recent concept being launched in Houston about 90 days ago and now in 3 stores there. We'll roll out this concept to 2 other pilot markets in the U.S. in the coming months. And then the other one is FFI, which is what we call the fresh food initiative, where we're using third-party commissaries to deliver multiple times per week fresh products. So we continue to see improvements in the logistics cost and in the spoilage of this offer, so much so that we're confident enough at this point to roll this into -- excuse me, an additional 300 stores yet this fiscal year. So overall pleased with the progress on food, but there's more to be done.\n\n---\n\nThe next set of questions come from Peter Sklar, BMO Capital Markets. First question. In your schedule on Page 11 of the press release, you indicated that SG&A expenses were lower by 0.9% as a result of lower electronic payment fees. Can you please explain how these lower fees are rising? Are they a result of renegotiation of credit card companies? Or do the lower fees reflect some other structural changes, such as the efforts by the Canadian federal government to encourage lower fees?\n\n---\n\nI will say the credit card fees are mainly related to fuel transaction and are in percentage of it. The fuel retail price is declining. As such, we should see an expense or the expenses follow the same trend as we're seeing right now. This is the main reason explaining this variation. Of course, the variation in theory should also be integrated eventually into gross margin established by the market or I will say reflected in the market. That being said, clearly, know the effort or we didn't see any kind of, I will say, impact or significant impact from any effort done up to now. The efforts are going in the right direction but perhaps not enough physically strong to see the real impact out there basically in the market.\n\n---\n\nThe next question. You indicated that you have acquired the minority interest in Circle K Asia. Can you provide a description of this entity and your reasons for buying out this minority? Would Circle K Asia potentially be a platform for an Asian acquisition?\n\n---\n\nI will say this transaction was a reverse of the one that we done years ago in order to accelerate our licensing program in Asia. We did exercise our right to buy it back considering the results and considering the potential, I will say, the transaction announced in between our partners [indiscernible]. I will say this entity are -- and I will say -- and our Asian partners are clearly our platforms. And when I'm talking about Asian partners, I'm talking about the rest of our Asian partners. This entity and the future relation with our Asian partners are clearly our platform to continue to develop this part of the world throughout different approaches.\n\n---\n\nThe next set of questions come from Michael Van Aelst from TD Securities. The first question. Where do you stand on the integration of The Pantry, including the rebranding of the stores under the Circle K banner, aligning pricing strategies and implementation of Polar Pop and other important programs? Can you provide some insight on -- as to how store performance will change upon rebranding?\n\n---\n\nSo at a high level, I think we're very pleased with the integration of The Pantry. It's a huge change effort on a lot of fronts, and I couldn't be more pleased with the results the team is delivering. The businesses have been fully incorporated into our 4 existing business units, and then we set up one additional business unit. So our structure is fully in place. I covered the brand. I will touch on a couple other components. Polar Pop, which is one of the cornerstones of the Circle K brand, we'll be introducing that to 900 sites this year. We've completed over 100 locations in the last 45 days and moving with their rapid pace to get that in place in advance of the store brand change. In terms of alignment, we've aligned certainly from a merchandise procurement standpoint, as we talked about synergies being generated there but also well underway in terms of aligning retail pricing, both inside and outside the store. And finally, I can't give an -- or a forecast on results, but we're very confident that the synergies of combining the 2 networks, creating a very high market share and high consumer awareness in these markets and then finally, if nothing else, refreshing the locations, many of which in The Pantry network needed a facelift. With all these combined, we'll go a long way towards generating strong results into the coming months and years.\n\n---\n\nThe second question. Please provide us with an update on the rollout of the new coffee program in North America. How many stores now have it? What has been the customer reaction to-date? Can you also provide an update on the private label initiative in North America and its sales penetration?\n\n---\n\nI'll start with coffee. In Europe, we've rolled it out to probably 3/4 of the network. Results are strong there, double-digit cup increases and very strong sales increases. It's a premium product. In North America, we've rolled out to about 250 stores, of which about half of those -- or 160 of them are in Canada. I would say it's very early to conclude, but at the high level, they're certainly outperforming our base stores in terms of cups per day. And we think penetration of this offer and acceptance of this offer will improve as we get more penetration and we're able to communicate that we have absolutely the best cup of coffee on the road.\n\n---\n\nThe next set of questions come from...\n\n---\n\nI must continue with private label just a second here. On private label, to-date, we've launched about 900 SKUs in Europe. We still have a fairly large automotive sales category in Europe. So a lot of our SKUs are focused on that as a first step. In North America, in contrast, we've launched 120 SKUs over the last year. Those would be focused more on candy, snacks and beverages. In terms of penetration so far across our business units, I would say we range from a low of 2% penetration to a high of 5% so far. So again, given a fairly recent launch in both Europe and North America, we're very pleased with the penetration. And we'll continue to look for new ways to provide value for our customers with private label products.\n\n---\n\nThe next set of questions come from Keith Howlett, Desjardins Securities. The first question. Could you expand on the integration of The Pantry in terms of process, division of Kangaroo stores among Circle K divisions, and adjustments to merchandising fuel contracts and lease financing arrangements?\n\n---\n\nI think Brian already did answer well to this point. We can pass to the next one.\n\n---\n\nThe next question. In terms of private label, which categories of goods are you targeting? And what is consumer response to this program so far? I believe this question has already been addressed previously in Brian's -- response, so we'll move on to the next one. The next set of questions are from Christopher Li from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please discuss the performance of the cigarette category compared to last year. Are you seeing any improvements in volume decline as well as less promotional pricing pressures compared to last year?\n\n---\n\nI will say the volume of cigarettes sold did increase globally.\n\n---\n\nIn our network.\n\n---\n\nIn our network, yes, of course. Good point.\n\n---\n\nIn terms of pricing pressure, we believe that as retails continue to rise, the margins will continue to be pressured in that category. We're very committed to the category in keeping those customers.\n\n---\n\nI guess the next question. How is the real gourmet hotdog program performing in Europe relative to expectations? When was this program launched? In how many stores is it being offered? And what's the plan to expand the program to more stores?\n\n---\n\nAll right. So this program was -- for those of you who don't know what it is, it's really our effort to reinvent and differentiate the hotdog category with very unique gourmet hotdog offerings that vary with local taste. We've launched our first market in May, and to-date in Europe, we've launched it in 650 locations in 4 countries. Strong growth in all 4, and I would say strong double-digit growth in 3 of the 4 countries that we've launched to-date. And our teams have done a fantastic job of redefining and differentiating what everybody assumed was a very mature category. So again, very encouraged with our start there.\n\n---\n\nThe next set of questions come from Mr. Jim Durran, Barclays Research. Can you provide us with some indication as to how much of the U.S. comparable store gasoline volume lift versus the Q4 comparable store volume increase of 6.4% was attributable to the inclusion of The Pantry and related changes in pricing strategy in that business versus a more transient summer driving seasonal lift or a substantial increase in other regions of the United States business due to other pricing volume strategy changes? Once again, this question has already been addressed in previous responses, so we'll be moving to the next one. Can you provide us with an estimate of how much the recent -- recently divested lubricant business contributed to the European division's revenue, gross profit and EBITDA in fiscal 2015?\n\n---\n\nI will say considering it's a private nature and the dealer is still not closed, I would prefer to stay a little bit, I will say, to not provide any specific -- just to give you a sense in the other revenue line, it's an important part basically of left of this line than -- but other than that, the rest, I will prefer basically to keep that for when the deal will be closed.\n\n---\n\nThe next set of questions come from Perry Caicco from the CIBC. What is the acquisition landscape in Europe right now? How have low oil prices affected the M&A situation?\n\n---\n\nI will say -- I did answer to the first part. For the oil price, I will say it could be an additional element or a decision point for the major fuel company and could be preferrable [ph]. But again, it's not necessarily something that -- where we'll see the results [indiscernible] on a short-term basis. I think we need to continue to monitor and see the impact that, that could have.\n\n---\n\nThe next question. How do the deals like Circle K Asia minority buy in and the new Mexico Circle K deal turn out in your numbers? And are they meaningful?\n\n---\n\nI'll say they are not necessarily meaningful in terms of dollars, but they're clearly, I will say, important and strategic for our future international business development. It's great basically to continue to develop our brand in these markets with our great partners that we have in these.\n\n---\n\nAnd just to be clear, Circle K Mexico deal has not been rebranded as Circle K. So those results are not in our numbers so far.\n\n---\n\nAbsolutely.\n\n---\n\nThe next set of questions come from Vishal Shreedhar from the National Bank Financial. In the disclosed material, it states that some same-store sales growth and comparable volume growth benefited from the contribution of The Pantry. If we were to exclude The Pantry, how would the same-store sales growth and comparative volume look?\n\n---\n\nI will say, unfortunately, we're not providing necessarily the split. And I think we did already basically cover, but we're not providing more information or detailed information on this part.\n\n---\n\nThe next question. The purchase price allocation is not yet complete, and this may result in higher depreciation. Will depreciation expense materially change? Can you provide us with a preliminary indication of run rate depreciation and amortization for modeling purposes?\n\n---\n\nClearly, it will increase the depreciation, but I still don't have, I will say, enough support or final support and visibility to be able to conclude yet or to give any kind of indication, again, that will provide these indications. And that should be completed in the following quarters. And in the next quarters, you will have and you will see the final allocation be completed in our financial statement and financial information that we'll provide.\n\n---\n\nThe net set of questions come from Martin Landry from GMP Securities. Your fuel volumes have increased by 9% on same-store basis in the U.S. Is there a significant difference between the growth of the volumes in The Pantry network versus your legacy network? Again, this question has already been addressed and answered in a previous response. So we'll move on to the next one. You have signed an agreement with Commercializzazione [ph] in Mexico to rebrand 700 stores. Can you give us some color on this strategy? Is this a licensing agreement? And why are you attracted to the Mexican market?\n\n---\n\nThis is our licensee in Mexico, and that's about the extra network from [indiscernible]. And as we previously mentioned, this is an agreement to eventually rebrand these stores basically to our brand. I presumably took the decision, of course, basically because of the strain of our brand Circle K in this market and the growing basically position of our [indiscernible] in this market. And the Mexican market is a great place basically to grow.\n\n---\n\nAnd we're strong, if you look at Southern California, Arizona, parts of Texas. So we're along the border. So it's a natural extension to our markets, and as the fuel market opens up in the coming years, as the government is committed to and continues to explore looking at Mexico more deeply.\n\n---\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes the webcast presentation for today. We hope we have answered all your questions. Thank you for your attention and for your interest in Couche-Tard.\n\n---\n\nThank you, everyone.\n\n---\n\nThank you very much.\n\n---\n\nBye.",

First question. Results in the United States were particularly strong in Q1, especially gas volumes and margins. Can you talk about what you are seeing from a consumer demand perspective, both for gas and inside the store? What were the key factors behind the 9.4% same-store gas volume growth and the 5.1% merchandise same-store sales growth in the United States? This question has already been addressed in the previous response. Therefore, we're going to pass to the second question. You've had a focus on the fresh offerings and a number of tests of different approaches and offerings. Can you please provide an update on the fresh incentives across geographic -- geographies and your current thinking of how the offerings is likely to evolve?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Brian Hannasch (Executives)】\nBe happy to. So I'll start with Europe. Europe, our focus is on on-site prepared foods. We continue to perform very well there and driven by menu innovation. We'll talk about it in the following question, but real hotdogs have been launched on a good part of the network and showing good results. And then we've also launched some pastry pilots to see if we can innovate and differentiate our pastry offerings in Europe. North America, as we communicated in prior quarters, we continue down a parallel path with prepared on-site being done in several hundred stores with most recent concept being launched in Houston about 90 days ago and now in 3 stores there. We'll roll out this concept to 2 other pilot markets in the U.S. in the coming months. And then the other one is FFI, which is what we call the fresh food initiative, where we're using third-party commissaries to deliver multiple times per week fresh products. So we continue to see improvements in the logistics cost and in the spoilage of this offer, so much so that we're confident enough at this point to roll this into -- excuse me, an additional 300 stores yet this fiscal year. So overall pleased with the progress on food, but there's more to be done.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Christine Anagnostou (Executives)】\nThe next set of questions come from Peter Sklar, BMO Capital Markets. First question. In your schedule on Page 11 of the press release, you indicated that SG&A expenses were lower by 0.9% as a result of lower electronic payment fees. Can you please explain how these lower fees are rising? Are they a result of renegotiation of credit card companies? Or do the lower fees reflect some other structural changes, such as the efforts by the Canadian federal government to encourage lower fees?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Raymond Paré (Executives)】\nI will say the credit card fees are mainly related to fuel transaction and are in percentage of it. The fuel retail price is declining. As such, we should see an expense or the expenses follow the same trend as we're seeing right now. This is the main reason explaining this variation. Of course, the variation in theory should also be integrated eventually into gross margin established by the market or I will say reflected in the market. That being said, clearly, know the effort or we didn't see any kind of, I will say, impact or significant impact from any effort done up to now. The efforts are going in the right direction but perhaps not enough physically strong to see the real impact out there basically in the market.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Christine Anagnostou (Executives)】\nThe next question. You indicated that you have acquired the minority interest in Circle K Asia. Can you provide a description of this entity and your reasons for buying out this minority? Would Circle K Asia potentially be a platform for an Asian acquisition?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Raymond Paré (Executives)】\nI will say this transaction was a reverse of the one that we done years ago in order to accelerate our licensing program in Asia. We did exercise our right to buy it back considering the results and considering the potential, I will say, the transaction announced in between our partners [indiscernible]. I will say this entity are -- and I will say -- and our Asian partners are clearly our platforms. And when I'm talking about Asian partners, I'm talking about the rest of our Asian partners. This entity and the future relation with our Asian partners are clearly our platform to continue to develop this part of the world throughout different approaches.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Christine Anagnostou (Executives)】\nThe next set of questions come from Michael Van Aelst from TD Securities. The first question. Where do you stand on the integration of The Pantry, including the rebranding of the stores under the Circle K banner, aligning pricing strategies and implementation of Polar Pop and other important programs? Can you provide some insight on -- as to how store performance will change upon rebranding?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Brian Hannasch (Executives)】\nSo at a high level, I think we're very pleased with the integration of The Pantry. It's a huge change effort on a lot of fronts, and I couldn't be more pleased with the results the team is delivering. The businesses have been fully incorporated into our 4 existing business units, and then we set up one additional business unit. So our structure is fully in place. I covered the brand. I will touch on a couple other components. Polar Pop, which is one of the cornerstones of the Circle K brand, we'll be introducing that to 900 sites this year. We've completed over 100 locations in the last 45 days and moving with their rapid pace to get that in place in advance of the store brand change. In terms of alignment, we've aligned certainly from a merchandise procurement standpoint, as we talked about synergies being generated there but also well underway in terms of aligning retail pricing, both inside and outside the store. And finally, I can't give an -- or a forecast on results, but we're very confident that the synergies of combining the 2 networks, creating a very high market share and high consumer awareness in these markets and then finally, if nothing else, refreshing the locations, many of which in The Pantry network needed a facelift. With all these combined, we'll go a long way towards generating strong results into the coming months and years.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Christine Anagnostou (Executives)】\nThe second question. Please provide us with an update on the rollout of the new coffee program in North America. How many stores now have it? What has been the customer reaction to-date? Can you also provide an update on the private label initiative in North America and its sales penetration?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Brian Hannasch (Executives)】\nI'll start with coffee. In Europe, we've rolled it out to probably 3/4 of the network. Results are strong there, double-digit cup increases and very strong sales increases. It's a premium product. In North America, we've rolled out to about 250 stores, of which about half of those -- or 160 of them are in Canada. I would say it's very early to conclude, but at the high level, they're certainly outperforming our base stores in terms of cups per day. And we think penetration of this offer and acceptance of this offer will improve as we get more penetration and we're able to communicate that we have absolutely the best cup of coffee on the road.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Christine Anagnostou (Executives)】\nThe next set of questions come from...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Brian Hannasch (Executives)】\nI must continue with private label just a second here. On private label, to-date, we've launched about 900 SKUs in Europe. We still have a fairly large automotive sales category in Europe. So a lot of our SKUs are focused on that as a first step. In North America, in contrast, we've launched 120 SKUs over the last year. Those would be focused more on candy, snacks and beverages. In terms of penetration so far across our business units, I would say we range from a low of 2% penetration to a high of 5% so far. So again, given a fairly recent launch in both Europe and North America, we're very pleased with the penetration. And we'll continue to look for new ways to provide value for our customers with private label products.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Christine Anagnostou (Executives)】\nThe next set of questions come from Keith Howlett, Desjardins Securities. The first question. Could you expand on the integration of The Pantry in terms of process, division of Kangaroo stores among Circle K divisions, and adjustments to merchandising fuel contracts and lease financing arrangements?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Raymond Paré (Executives)】\nI think Brian already did answer well to this point. We can pass to the next one.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Christine Anagnostou (Executives)】\nThe next question. In terms of private label, which categories of goods are you targeting? And what is consumer response to this program so far? I believe this question has already been addressed previously in Brian's -- response, so we'll move on to the next one. The next set of questions are from Christopher Li from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please discuss the performance of the cigarette category compared to last year. Are you seeing any improvements in volume decline as well as less promotional pricing pressures compared to last year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Raymond Paré (Executives)】\nI will say the volume of cigarettes sold did increase globally.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Brian Hannasch (Executives)】\nIn our network.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Raymond Paré (Executives)】\nIn our network, yes, of course. Good point.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Brian Hannasch (Executives)】\nIn terms of pricing pressure, we believe that as retails continue to rise, the margins will continue to be pressured in that category. We're very committed to the category in keeping those customers.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Christine Anagnostou (Executives)】\nI guess the next question. How is the real gourmet hotdog program performing in Europe relative to expectations? When was this program launched? In how many stores is it being offered? And what's the plan to expand the program to more stores?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Brian Hannasch (Executives)】\nAll right. So this program was -- for those of you who don't know what it is, it's really our effort to reinvent and differentiate the hotdog category with very unique gourmet hotdog offerings that vary with local taste. We've launched our first market in May, and to-date in Europe, we've launched it in 650 locations in 4 countries. Strong growth in all 4, and I would say strong double-digit growth in 3 of the 4 countries that we've launched to-date. And our teams have done a fantastic job of redefining and differentiating what everybody assumed was a very mature category. So again, very encouraged with our start there.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Christine Anagnostou (Executives)】\nThe next set of questions come from Mr. Jim Durran, Barclays Research. Can you provide us with some indication as to how much of the U.S. comparable store gasoline volume lift versus the Q4 comparable store volume increase of 6.4% was attributable to the inclusion of The Pantry and related changes in pricing strategy in that business versus a more transient summer driving seasonal lift or a substantial increase in other regions of the United States business due to other pricing volume strategy changes? Once again, this question has already been addressed in previous responses, so we'll be moving to the next one. Can you provide us with an estimate of how much the recent -- recently divested lubricant business contributed to the European division's revenue, gross profit and EBITDA in fiscal 2015?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Raymond Paré (Executives)】\nI will say considering it's a private nature and the dealer is still not closed, I would prefer to stay a little bit, I will say, to not provide any specific -- just to give you a sense in the other revenue line, it's an important part basically of left of this line than -- but other than that, the rest, I will prefer basically to keep that for when the deal will be closed.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Christine Anagnostou (Executives)】\nThe next set of questions come from Perry Caicco from the CIBC. What is the acquisition landscape in Europe right now? How have low oil prices affected the M&A situation?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Raymond Paré (Executives)】\nI will say -- I did answer to the first part. For the oil price, I will say it could be an additional element or a decision point for the major fuel company and could be preferrable [ph]. But again, it's not necessarily something that -- where we'll see the results [indiscernible] on a short-term basis. I think we need to continue to monitor and see the impact that, that could have.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Christine Anagnostou (Executives)】\nThe next question. How do the deals like Circle K Asia minority buy in and the new Mexico Circle K deal turn out in your numbers? And are they meaningful?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Raymond Paré (Executives)】\nI'll say they are not necessarily meaningful in terms of dollars, but they're clearly, I will say, important and strategic for our future international business development. It's great basically to continue to develop our brand in these markets with our great partners that we have in these.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Brian Hannasch (Executives)】\nAnd just to be clear, Circle K Mexico deal has not been rebranded as Circle K. So those results are not in our numbers so far.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Raymond Paré (Executives)】\nAbsolutely.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Christine Anagnostou (Executives)】\nThe next set of questions come from Vishal Shreedhar from the National Bank Financial. In the disclosed material, it states that some same-store sales growth and comparable volume growth benefited from the contribution of The Pantry. If we were to exclude The Pantry, how would the same-store sales growth and comparative volume look?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Raymond Paré (Executives)】\nI will say, unfortunately, we're not providing necessarily the split. And I think we did already basically cover, but we're not providing more information or detailed information on this part.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Christine Anagnostou (Executives)】\nThe next question. The purchase price allocation is not yet complete, and this may result in higher depreciation. Will depreciation expense materially change? Can you provide us with a preliminary indication of run rate depreciation and amortization for modeling purposes?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Raymond Paré (Executives)】\nClearly, it will increase the depreciation, but I still don't have, I will say, enough support or final support and visibility to be able to conclude yet or to give any kind of indication, again, that will provide these indications. And that should be completed in the following quarters. And in the next quarters, you will have and you will see the final allocation be completed in our financial statement and financial information that we'll provide.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Christine Anagnostou (Executives)】\nThe net set of questions come from Martin Landry from GMP Securities. Your fuel volumes have increased by 9% on same-store basis in the U.S. Is there a significant difference between the growth of the volumes in The Pantry network versus your legacy network? Again, this question has already been addressed and answered in a previous response. So we'll move on to the next one. You have signed an agreement with Commercializzazione [ph] in Mexico to rebrand 700 stores. Can you give us some color on this strategy? Is this a licensing agreement? And why are you attracted to the Mexican market?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Raymond Paré (Executives)】\nThis is our licensee in Mexico, and that's about the extra network from [indiscernible]. And as we previously mentioned, this is an agreement to eventually rebrand these stores basically to our brand. I presumably took the decision, of course, basically because of the strain of our brand Circle K in this market and the growing basically position of our [indiscernible] in this market. And the Mexican market is a great place basically to grow.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Brian Hannasch (Executives)】\nAnd we're strong, if you look at Southern California, Arizona, parts of Texas. So we're along the border. So it's a natural extension to our markets, and as the fuel market opens up in the coming years, as the government is committed to and continues to explore looking at Mexico more deeply.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Christine Anagnostou (Executives)】\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes the webcast presentation for today. We hope we have answered all your questions. Thank you for your attention and for your interest in Couche-Tard.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Brian Hannasch (Executives)】\nThank you, everyone.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Raymond Paré (Executives)】\nThank you very much.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Christine Anagnostou (Executives)】\nBye.",

With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, IT and ALLDATA; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. \r\nRegarding the fourth quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them.\r\nTo begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across the globe for another solid quarter and year. 2015 was a very busy and productive year for us. We continue to grow our business on a variety of fronts. \r\nOur U.S. Retail business expanded again in 2015 with the opening of another 157 net new stores. Our Commercial business continues to gain traction, growing sales 12.9% for the year, with 296 net new programs opened. We now have the commercial program in 81% of our domestic stores having opened 720 new programs in just the past 2 years. And we continue to expand our presence in Mexico, where this quarter, we celebrated the opening of our 441st store. While opening no additional stores in Brazil this quarter, we opened 2 for the year and now have 7 stores in operation. Lastly, we opened 3 new IMC branches for the year. We have a lot of runway to open future IMC locations. We currently have approximately 90% of our total company sales coming from our domestic AutoZone stores. We believe we have great growth opportunities inside and outside of the U.S. for many years to come. \r\nIn 2015, we expanded our online offerings in both our traditional autozone.com and autozonepro.com websites as well as AutoAnything. ALLDATA also continued its expansion into Europe. \r\nAlong with these strategic investments, we spend a lot of time on initiatives to drive our core domestic Retail business. DIY remains our #1 priority. Our DIY business continues to grow, remains the largest portion of our sales and continues to generate tremendous returns. We also see significant opportunities for new store growth and improved productivity in our existing stores. As our Commercial business continues to grow and is intertwined with our Retail business, we've continued to identify opportunities to optimize our inventory placement and distribution strategy in order to respond to the ever-increasing challenge of parts proliferation in the industry. \r\nOver the past 2 years, we implemented new methodologies to improve our hard parts placement techniques in all stores. We've been testing more frequent deliveries to our stores and expanded parts availability in the MegaHub stores. Additionally, we have developed a new store prototype that significantly expands the hard part holding capacity in our stores. All new stores are now opening with this new prototype, and we remodeled 93 of our most constrained stores. These efforts have resulted in an increase in our store inventory levels. They've also added incremental costs, but sales had justified our investments and offered convincing proof that we've been on the right track.\r\nAlong with improving our local parts availability and assortment, we continue to manage this organization to provide exceptional service for our customers, provide AutoZoners with a great place to work with opportunities for advancement and ensure we do it on a profitable basis to provide strong returns for our shareholders. \r\nWe'll be holding our National Sales Meeting in Memphis next week. All week, and again during my address to the team at the inclusion [ph] of the event, we are rededicating ourselves to live the pledge. Our pledge starts with always putting customers first, and therefore, we are always looking for ways to improve our model.\r\nAs our product assortment continues to improve, we feel it is essential to reinstill a passion to say, \"Yes, we've got it\", to our customers' needs. To this day, it surprises me how often we have to say, \"Sorry, we don't have that available.\" Even with our new part additions, too many customers leave our stores without their needs being met. \r\nIn this spirit to help the customer, we continue to make significant systems enhancements and to capture data about our customer shopping patterns across all of our platforms. We understand we have to be able to share information and process seamlessly between our customers -- between our stores, commercial shops, phone and online experiences in order to meet all of our customers' needs. \r\nBefore getting into specifics on the fourth quarter, I'd like to take a moment to go into detail on our inventory availability test. We've concluded our test and determined the framework of our new supply chain strategy. Over the last couple of years, we have been testing 2 specific new concepts: increased frequency of delivery to our stores; and significantly expanded parts assortments in select stores we call MegaHubs. As both of these concepts are a material departure from our long-standing successful strategy and both of them increase our fixed cost structure, we've been patient. We wanted to ensure that the results we initially achieved were accurate and sustainable. The first test, multiple deliveries per week, focuses on improving our in-stock position in stores for regularly stocked SKUs. The plan was to replenish our stores from their respective distribution center more frequently. \r\nOn the last quarter's call, we said a little over 900 of our 5,100 domestic stores were receiving either 3- or 5- time per week deliveries. This was up from the usual once-a-week delivery schedules we've historically run. With approximately 21,000 SKUs in an average AutoZone store, we tested what increasing the replenishment frequency of these SKUs meant. Although our inventory turns at a relatively low rate, around 1.5x per year, the vast majority of our SKUs have an on-hand quantity of 1. Therefore, given the randomness of demand, there is potential for out-of-stock positions. There are clearly increased costs associated with delivering more frequently. However, the sales lift achieved from our test has supported increasing the delivery frequency in the majority of the chain to either 3 times per week or 5 times per week, depending on certain parameters.\r\nIt is important to note that our current plans do not contemplate providing this level of service to all stores. It just isn't currently economically viable everywhere. Over the next 12 months, we expect to roll this increased frequency model to approximately an additional 1,000 stores. We will begin this rollout in the first quarter. Roughly speaking, we are modeling a gross margin headwind from this initiative of approximately 25 basis points each quarter until we complete the rollout. It will take us a few years to roll out this new strategy, but once it is complete, we would expect roughly 2/3 of our stores to have increased frequency of deliveries. As we implement this further, we will continue to monitor our performance and will further refine the stores on this program. \r\nThe second test that we are rolling out is a MegaHubs store concept. We'll open and/or expand another handful of MegaHubs in 2016, increasing from our current count of 5 MegaHubs. We are very excited about what the MegaHubs can represent for us. We will open these locations over the back 6 months of our fiscal year. As a reminder, these super-sized AutoZone stores carry between 80,000 to 100,000 unique SKUs, approximately twice what a hub store carries today. They provide coverage to both surrounding stores and other hub stores multiple times a day or over -- on an overnight basis. Our sales results, thus far, in our open MegaHubs are exceeding our expectations. We have been pleasantly surprised to see the sales generated by the new, unique SKU additions, lifting both our Retail and Commercial businesses. \r\nWhile there are incremental costs to these rollouts, such as payroll and fuel to manage the extra deliveries to surrounding stores, we feel their cost deleverage is relatively modest. Our current assumption on this rollout is that we won't experience meaningful deleverage from this initiative in fiscal 2016. Currently, 5 MegaHubs support approximately 750 surrounding stores. And once built up, we'd expect to have a network of MegaHubs in the neighborhood of 25 to 40 total locations. Like the weekly delivers from our distribution centers, we expect to complete our MegaHub expansion over the next few years.\r\nIn order to support more frequent deliveries to new stores as well as the MegaHubs, we expect to open 2 or 3 domestic distribution centers over the next 2 or 3 years. For your modeling purposes, each new distribution center is expected to cost between $40 million to $45 million. At present, we are in the early stages of planning their openings and don't expect any distribution center to come online in early -- until early fiscal 2017. \r\nFiscal 2016 will incur some capital and operating expenses related to development but a larger portion of the capital we'll spend will be in fiscal 2017 and '18. \r\nWe are very excited to have reached a conclusion on these strategic changes. We had a tremendous amount of AutoZoners who worked this extremely hard and with great discipline. Due to their incredible efforts and patience, we believe we have identified the optimum approach to managing our supply chain. \r\nIn recent years, AutoZone has completed small acquisitions with AutoAnything and IMC. We currently expect our cash from investing in the businesses upcoming year to look similar to this past year. Our capital investments are expected to offset the capital used in the acquisitions.\r\nTo summarize our plans. We expect to roll out more frequent distribution center deliveries and more MegaHub locations over the next few years. We also expect to open 2 or 3 new domestic distribution centers over this time. While our total use of capital will not be materially different than next year from this past, we do expect to incur an approximate 20 to 30 basis point gross margin headwind from these investments alone. This past fiscal year, we faced headwinds to our gross margin, and we were able to overcome them and post improvements in each of our quarters. We believe in fiscal 2016, we have opportunities for improvement but we remain cautious, as we know we'll experience more significant supply chain headwinds. \r\nNow let's turn to our fourth quarter results. Our sales increased 7.9%. Our domestic same-store sales were up 4.5%. This quarter sales results were stronger toward the back half of our fiscal quarter than the beginning. While May was the weakest month of comp store performance, the comparison to the previous year's May was a contributor. May was quite strong the year before. The remaining months were very consistent. We attribute this to consistent weather across much of the country and steadily lower fuel prices. Regionally, the Northeast and the Midwest performed slightly below our overall chain. However, these 2 markets were slightly better the year before. In regard to our 3 primary merchandise category splits, failure-related, maintenance and discretionary, failure performed best, followed closely in growth over last year by maintenance and then discretionary. \r\nWe attribute failure strength to more miles being driven across the country and failure occurring with the vehicle usage in addition to favorable weather. Both traffic and ticket were positive for our DIY and Commercial businesses. We opened 134 new commercial programs in the quarter versus 113 last year. For the year, we opened 296 net programs for the full year, reaching 81% of our domestic store base. Our sales grew 13% on the year. Our programs opened grew by 8%. We are proud of our Commercial results this year, and as our programs continue to mature, we believe our future is bright. \r\nAs part of our strategy on increasing inventory levels in local markets closer to our customers, this past quarter, we opened 3 additional hub locations and now operate 176. As mentioned above regarding opening more MegaHub locations, we do expect to open more standard hub locations as well. Over time, we expect to operate as many as 200 to 225 stores as hubs, but that growth is expected over many years to come. \r\nRegarding Mexico. We opened 23 stores this quarter and now have 441 total locations. While Mexico's U.S. dollar sales were below historic growth rates, we executed well, especially in light of the foreign currency headwinds experienced with the peso. \r\nSales in our other businesses for the quarter were up 2% over last year. As a reminder, our ALLDATA and eCommerce businesses, which include autozone.com and AutoAnything, make up this segment of sales. \r\nRegarding online sales opportunities, there continue to be great opportunities for growth on both a business-to-business basis and to individual customers, or B2C. These businesses are relatively small for us, representing just 3.4% of our total sales mix on the quarter. Overall, we feel like we are well positioned in 2016 to improve on 2015's results. \r\nWith the continued aging of the car population, as we continue to be optimistic regarding trends for our industry in both DIY and DIFM, as new vehicle sales are reaching all-time highs and gas prices, on average, are down year-over-year, miles driven continue to increase. The lower end customer benefits the most from lower gas prices relative to income. This trend is encouraging.\r\nI know with our new fiscal year upon us, many investors have asked about our expectations for 2016. For us, our second and third quarter results are more difficult comparisons. However, we are optimistic we can grow on all of our upcoming quarters. While certain markets outperformed during the winter this past year, others underperformed. We believe we should improve in these regions. As our history has shown, we manage this business focusing on both short-term and long-term performance. And if we felt our sales would be challenged in the short-term due to difficult comparisons, we wouldn't make material changes to our plans or operations. We will continue to balance short-term and long-term performance, and we'll be keenly focused on delivering consistent strong performance and extending our streak of 36 consecutive quarters of double-digit EPS growth.\r\nHowever, with our delivery frequency initiative, along with expanding MegaHubs, we will likely have some headwinds on our operating margin. \r\nNow let me review our highlights regarding execution of our operating theme for 2015: WOW! Every Customer Everywhere. The key priorities for the year were Great People Providing Great Service!, profitably growing our Commercial business, leveraging the Internet, leveraging technology to improve the customer experience while optimizing efficiencies and improving availability. \r\nOn the retail front this past quarter, under the Great People Providing Great Service! theme, we continued with our intense focus on improving execution. We've continually been upgrading our product content in both our electronic catalogs and online offerings. We've also been focused on improving our mobile app to be relevant across our fastest-growing online category. We've been aggressive on our technology investments and believe these initiatives will help differentiate us on a go-forward basis. We believe -- or we realized as customers have become much more tech and mobile savvy, we have to have a sales proposition that touches all the ways they desire to interact with us. Our current and future technology investments will lead to sales growth across all our businesses. \r\nIn regards to Commercial, we opened 134 programs during the quarter. For the year, we opened 296 versus 424 last year. Our expectation is we will continue to open new programs and grow our percentage of stores with the commercial programs, although our pace of growth will likely moderate. \r\nAs we continue to improve our product assortments and availability, and as we make other refinements to our offerings, we expect that the estimated sales potential from the market will grow. Our results continue to provide us confidence to be aggressive in adding additional resources and new programs to this important growth initiative. \r\nWe should also highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital as we were able to finish 2015 at 31.2%. We are very pleased with this metric as it is one of the best in all of Hardlines retail. However, our primarily focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return well in excess of our cost to capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship as the capital we invest is our investors' capital. \r\nBefore I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I'd like to thank and reinforce how proud we are of our entire organization's efforts to manage the business appropriately and prudently. We have an amazing team, and our initiatives for 2016 are very exciting. With our ongoing supply chain initiatives as well as new store openings, we are ready to continue to provide WOW! Customer Service to all of our customers, and we are ready to continue to prudently manage our cost structure providing our shareholders with the consistency we have exhibited in the past. \r\nNow I'll turn it over to Bill Giles.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our Retail, Commercial and international results for the quarter. \r\nFor the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic Retail and Commercial businesses, our Mexico and Brazil stores and our 20 IMC branches, increased 8.1%. \r\nNow switching to macro trends. During the quarter, nationally, unleaded gas prices started out at $2.69 a gallon and ended the quarter at $2.51 a gallon, an $0.18 decrease. Last year, gas prices decreased $0.21 per gallon during the fourth quarter, starting at $3.67 and ending at $3.46 a gallon. We continue to believe gas prices have a real impact on our customers' ability to maintain their vehicles and cost reductions help all Americans. We hope to continue to benefit from this increase in disposable income. \r\nWe also recognize that the impact of miles driven on cars over 10 years old, the current average, is much different than on newer cars in terms of wear and tear. Miles driven increased 2.6% in May and 3.9% in June. Now we don't have July or August data yet. \r\nThe other statistic we highlight is the number of 7-year-and-older vehicles on the road, which continues to trend in our industry's favor. \r\nFor the trailing 4 quarters, total sales per AutoZone store were $1,761,000. This statistic continues to set the pace for the rest of the industry.\r\nNow for the quarter, total Commercial sales increased 13.1%. In the fourth quarter, Commercial represented 18% of our total sales and grew $70 million over last year's Q4. This past quarter, we opened 134 new programs versus 113 programs opened in our fourth quarter of last fiscal year. We now have our commercial program in 4,141 stores supported by 176 hub stores. Approximately 1,100 of our programs are 3 years old or younger.\r\nLet me take a moment to discuss our Commercial program performance. While our average weekly sales per program for the full year were below some peers in our industry at $8,800, our productivity continues to improve. It's important to highlight that we accelerated our new program growth over the past few years as approximately 26% of our programs are younger than 3 years old. These openings have impacted our average sales metric and cannibalized some of our older programs. However, our focus is on growing market share and improving our service levels by having more programs closer to our customers. \r\nLooking specifically at our mature programs, those at least 5 years old, they averaged $10,000 per week this past year and grew 6.2% over last year. While we will continue to open additional programs over the next several years, we will remain focused on improving the productivity of all our existing programs. We also feel very good about the success we've had in profitably growing the Commercial business, and we like our trajectory here. \r\nWith our inventory additions in support of the IMC acquisition, we are well positioned to grow our base business. Over the last several years, a significant amount of our focus has been on opening new programs and that will continue to be the case albeit at a slightly moderated pace. We have a very talented sales force, and we are enhancing training in introducing additional technology to optimize the productivity of the sales force. We've increased our efforts around analyzing customer purchasing trends and in-stock trends.\r\nIn summary, we remain committed to our long-term growth strategy. We believe we are well positioned to grow this business and capture increased market share, and we believe we can scale this business in a profitable manner. And we continue to be excited about our opportunities in this business for many years to come.\r\nNow moving on to Mexico. Our Mexico stores continued to perform well. We opened 23 new stores during the fourth quarter and 39 for the full year. We currently have 441 stores in Mexico. This upcoming year, we expect to open a similar 40 [ph] new stores, and we are on target to open a new distribution center. This will mark our second DC in the country and support Central Mexico store growth. \r\nWhile sales in base currency were above plan this past year, the devaluation in the peso was much greater than we assumed at the start of the year. The peso devalued 28% over the course of the year. This created a headwind that caused our reported U.S. dollars and EBIT to be lower than last year. The EBIT/dollar impact on the quarter, assuming constant currency with last year's foreign exchange rate, was meaningful, approximately double-digit millions of dollars. While we cannot control movements in functional currency versus planned assumptions, we feel the Mexico leadership did an exceptional job managing the peso-denominated business. \r\nAnd while we hope more favorable currency compares are in our future in fiscal 2016, we know our Mexico AutoZoners will continue to provide outstanding customer service. If the peso stays at these elevated levels, it will continue to pressure our U.S. dollar earnings for the next several quarters. \r\nNow regarding Brazil. We opened no stores in the quarter and had 7 stores opened at the end of the year. Our plans remain to open a few stores this upcoming fiscal 2016. While sales growth has been very encouraging, we have been challenged by weak Brazilian real relative to U.S. dollars as well. While the peso devalued 28%, the real devalued 60% on the year, and we remained in test phase on Brazil, but have been more encouraged of late due to our improved operating performance. \r\nNow recapping this past quarter's performance for the company in total. Our sales were $3,290,000,000, an increase of 7.9% over last year's fourth quarter. Domestic same-store sales or sales for stores opened more than 1 year were up 4.5% for the quarter. \r\nGross margin for the quarter was 52.5% of sales, up 20 basis points. The improvement in gross margin was attributable to higher merchandise margins, partially offset by the impact from higher supply chain costs associated with current year inventory initiatives and Interamerican Motor Corporation, which was acquired in September 2014. \r\nIn regards to inflation. It has been down slightly year-over-year. Currently, we feel costs will be predictable and manageable. We will remain cognizant of future developments regarding inflation, and we'll make the appropriate adjustments should they arise. \r\nLooking forward, we continue to believe there remains opportunity for gross margin expansion within both the Retail and Commercial businesses. But our Commercial business is growing at an accelerated rate and it has lower margins, which is adding pressure to our overall gross margins. It is important to note, we do not manage to target a gross margin percentage. We will also understand the headwinds from expanding our distribution center deliveries will cause. We will work diligently to offset these headwinds with a focus on lower acquisition cost. Our primary focus remains growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total auto parts segment.\r\nSG&A for the quarter was 32.2% of sales, higher by 52 basis points from last year's fourth quarter. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to legal cost, higher legal cost and the impact of the IMC acquisition. The legal cost growth this quarter was attributable to discrete matters that we would not expect to continue. The acquisition of IMC anniversaries this month in September, so we expect a majority of the deleverage to dissipate going forward. We continue to believe we are well positioned to manage our cost structure in response to our sales environment. \r\nEBIT for the quarter was $669 million, up 6.2% over last year's fourth quarter. Our EBIT margin was 20.3%. Interest expense for the quarter was $47.1 million compared with $49.4 million in Q4 a year ago. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $4,625,000,000 or approximately $300 million more than last year's balance of $4,323,000,000. Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.5x EBITDAR. While in any given quarter, we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions. We remain committed to both our investment-grade rating and our capital allocation strategy and share repurchases are an important element of that strategy. \r\nFor the quarter, our tax rate was in line with last year's Q4. We expect our annual rate to be closer to 36.5% on an ongoing basis as the deviation result is primarily driven by the resolution of discrete tax items that arise. \r\nNet income for the quarter was $401 million and up 7.4% over last year. Our diluted share count of 31.5 million was down 5% from last year's fourth quarter. \r\nThe combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $12.75, up 13% over the prior year's fourth quarter. \r\nNow relating to the cash flow statement. For the fourth fiscal quarter, we generated $526 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 6% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $188 million and reflect the additional expenditures required to open 97 new locations this quarter, capital expenditures on existing stores, hub and MegaHub store remodels or openings, work on the development of new stores for upcoming quarters and information technology investments. For all of fiscal 2015, our CapEx was approximately $480 million. With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 5,141 stores in 49 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, 441 stores in Mexico and 7 in Brazil for a total AutoZone store count of 5,589. We also had 20 IMC branches opened at fiscal year end, taking our total locations to 5,609. \r\nDepreciation totaled $87 million for the quarter versus last year's fourth quarter expense of $79 million, in line with recent quarter growth rates. \r\nWith our excess cash flow, we repurchased $430 million of AutoZone stock in the fourth quarter. At year end, we have $348 million remaining under our share buyback authorization, and our leverage metric was 2.5x at year end. Again -- oh, I stress we manage through appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only as each rating firm has its own criteria. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy. \r\nAccounts payable as a percentage of gross inventory finished the quarter at 113%. \r\nNext, I'd like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per-store basis. The company's inventory increased 9% over the same period last year, driven by increased product placement, new stores during the fiscal year and the acquisition of IMC. Inventory per location was $610,000 versus $582,000 last year and $629,000 last quarter. The IMC acquisition increased inventory per location by $15,000 this quarter. \r\nNet inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per-location basis, was a negative $79,000 versus negative $87,000 last year and negative $68,000 in just the last quarter. As a reminder, the addition of IMC has added $15,000 in inventory per location and reduced AP-to-inventory by approximately 2 percentage points. As we will now be anniversary-ing the acquisition, we expect to dramatically reduce pressure on these overall metrics going forward. \r\nFinally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing 4 quarters of 31.2%. We have and we'll continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital. \r\nNow I'll turn it back to Bill Rhodes.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Bill. We are pleased to report our 36th consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth and for the year to report an EPS growth rate of 14.1%. We also surpassed an historic milestone in 2015, exceeding $10 billion in sales for the first time in our company's rich history. Our companies continue to be successful over the long run. That success is attributable to our approach of leveraging our unique and powerful culture and focusing on the needs of our customers. \r\nTo execute at a high level, we have to consistently adhere to living the pledge. We cannot and will not take our eye off of execution. While we study the external environment and react where appropriate, we must stay committed to executing day in and day out on our game plan. Success will be achieved with an attention to detail and exceptional execution. \r\nBefore I conclude, I want to take this opportunity to reflect on fiscal 2015. We were able to build on past accomplishments and deliver some impressive results. In recognition of the dedication, passion and commitment of our AutoZoners, I want to highlight that we grew sales to a record $10.2 billion this past year and we grew same-store sales at 3.8%. We grew our store base in Mexico and managed our expenses exceptionally well in spite of the foreign currency headwind with the peso. We began our IMC integration, opened 3 new branches and now have 20 locations. With a minority of our AutoZone stores today able to sell IMC products, we feel we are well positioned to expand this business in the future. Our inventory availability testing and MegaHubs store remodels helped us to reach our conclusion and allowed us to announce our planned implementation schedule. I could not be more proud of the tremendous work everyone on this project contributed. \r\nAnd lastly, we will talk more about saying, yes, we've got it, to our customers. We are fixated on making sure we meet our customers' needs in 2016. Our offerings are the best they have ever been, and we are determined to communicate this to our customer base. At the end of the day, our customers have choices, and we must exceed their expectation. \r\nAgain, we are excited about our initiatives around inventory assortment and availability, hub stores, commercial growth, Mexico, ALLDATA, e-commerce, Brazil and IMC. Our long-term model is to grow new store square footage at a low single-digit growth rate, and we expect to continue growing our Commercial business at an accelerated rate. Therefore, we look to routinely grow EBIT dollars in the mid-single-digit range or better in times of strength. And we'll leverage our very strong and predictable cash flow to repurchase shares, enhancing our earnings per share growth into double digits. \r\nWe feel the track we are on will allow us to continue winning for the long run. We believe our steady, consistent strategy is correct. It is the attention to details and consistent execution that will matter. Our belief is solid, consistent strategy combined with superior execution is a formula for success. \r\nOur charge remains to optimize our performance regardless of market conditions and continue to ensure we are investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance. In the end, delivering strong EPS growth and ROIC each and every quarter is how we measure ourselves. We are pleased with our results this past year, but we must remain committed to delivering on our strategic and financial objectives. \r\nI can't wait to sit down and talk to our leadership team at our upcoming national sales meeting. This team is comprised of the best leaders in our industry. We are launching our Live The Pledge theme, and I know our leaders, combined with our talented team of roughly 80,000 AutoZoners, will do just that. \r\nNow we'd like to open up the call for questions.",

With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, IT and ALLDATA; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. \r\nRegarding the fourth quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them.\r\nTo begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across the globe for another solid quarter and year. 2015 was a very busy and productive year for us. We continue to grow our business on a variety of fronts. \r\nOur U.S. Retail business expanded again in 2015 with the opening of another 157 net new stores. Our Commercial business continues to gain traction, growing sales 12.9% for the year, with 296 net new programs opened. We now have the commercial program in 81% of our domestic stores having opened 720 new programs in just the past 2 years. And we continue to expand our presence in Mexico, where this quarter, we celebrated the opening of our 441st store. While opening no additional stores in Brazil this quarter, we opened 2 for the year and now have 7 stores in operation. Lastly, we opened 3 new IMC branches for the year. We have a lot of runway to open future IMC locations. We currently have approximately 90% of our total company sales coming from our domestic AutoZone stores. We believe we have great growth opportunities inside and outside of the U.S. for many years to come. \r\nIn 2015, we expanded our online offerings in both our traditional autozone.com and autozonepro.com websites as well as AutoAnything. ALLDATA also continued its expansion into Europe. \r\nAlong with these strategic investments, we spend a lot of time on initiatives to drive our core domestic Retail business. DIY remains our #1 priority. Our DIY business continues to grow, remains the largest portion of our sales and continues to generate tremendous returns. We also see significant opportunities for new store growth and improved productivity in our existing stores. As our Commercial business continues to grow and is intertwined with our Retail business, we've continued to identify opportunities to optimize our inventory placement and distribution strategy in order to respond to the ever-increasing challenge of parts proliferation in the industry. \r\nOver the past 2 years, we implemented new methodologies to improve our hard parts placement techniques in all stores. We've been testing more frequent deliveries to our stores and expanded parts availability in the MegaHub stores. Additionally, we have developed a new store prototype that significantly expands the hard part holding capacity in our stores. All new stores are now opening with this new prototype, and we remodeled 93 of our most constrained stores. These efforts have resulted in an increase in our store inventory levels. They've also added incremental costs, but sales had justified our investments and offered convincing proof that we've been on the right track.\r\nAlong with improving our local parts availability and assortment, we continue to manage this organization to provide exceptional service for our customers, provide AutoZoners with a great place to work with opportunities for advancement and ensure we do it on a profitable basis to provide strong returns for our shareholders. \r\nWe'll be holding our National Sales Meeting in Memphis next week. All week, and again during my address to the team at the inclusion [ph] of the event, we are rededicating ourselves to live the pledge. Our pledge starts with always putting customers first, and therefore, we are always looking for ways to improve our model.\r\nAs our product assortment continues to improve, we feel it is essential to reinstill a passion to say, \"Yes, we've got it\", to our customers' needs. To this day, it surprises me how often we have to say, \"Sorry, we don't have that available.\" Even with our new part additions, too many customers leave our stores without their needs being met. \r\nIn this spirit to help the customer, we continue to make significant systems enhancements and to capture data about our customer shopping patterns across all of our platforms. We understand we have to be able to share information and process seamlessly between our customers -- between our stores, commercial shops, phone and online experiences in order to meet all of our customers' needs. \r\nBefore getting into specifics on the fourth quarter, I'd like to take a moment to go into detail on our inventory availability test. We've concluded our test and determined the framework of our new supply chain strategy. Over the last couple of years, we have been testing 2 specific new concepts: increased frequency of delivery to our stores; and significantly expanded parts assortments in select stores we call MegaHubs. As both of these concepts are a material departure from our long-standing successful strategy and both of them increase our fixed cost structure, we've been patient. We wanted to ensure that the results we initially achieved were accurate and sustainable. The first test, multiple deliveries per week, focuses on improving our in-stock position in stores for regularly stocked SKUs. The plan was to replenish our stores from their respective distribution center more frequently. \r\nOn the last quarter's call, we said a little over 900 of our 5,100 domestic stores were receiving either 3- or 5- time per week deliveries. This was up from the usual once-a-week delivery schedules we've historically run. With approximately 21,000 SKUs in an average AutoZone store, we tested what increasing the replenishment frequency of these SKUs meant. Although our inventory turns at a relatively low rate, around 1.5x per year, the vast majority of our SKUs have an on-hand quantity of 1. Therefore, given the randomness of demand, there is potential for out-of-stock positions. There are clearly increased costs associated with delivering more frequently. However, the sales lift achieved from our test has supported increasing the delivery frequency in the majority of the chain to either 3 times per week or 5 times per week, depending on certain parameters.\r\nIt is important to note that our current plans do not contemplate providing this level of service to all stores. It just isn't currently economically viable everywhere. Over the next 12 months, we expect to roll this increased frequency model to approximately an additional 1,000 stores. We will begin this rollout in the first quarter. Roughly speaking, we are modeling a gross margin headwind from this initiative of approximately 25 basis points each quarter until we complete the rollout. It will take us a few years to roll out this new strategy, but once it is complete, we would expect roughly 2/3 of our stores to have increased frequency of deliveries. As we implement this further, we will continue to monitor our performance and will further refine the stores on this program. \r\nThe second test that we are rolling out is a MegaHubs store concept. We'll open and/or expand another handful of MegaHubs in 2016, increasing from our current count of 5 MegaHubs. We are very excited about what the MegaHubs can represent for us. We will open these locations over the back 6 months of our fiscal year. As a reminder, these super-sized AutoZone stores carry between 80,000 to 100,000 unique SKUs, approximately twice what a hub store carries today. They provide coverage to both surrounding stores and other hub stores multiple times a day or over -- on an overnight basis. Our sales results, thus far, in our open MegaHubs are exceeding our expectations. We have been pleasantly surprised to see the sales generated by the new, unique SKU additions, lifting both our Retail and Commercial businesses. \r\nWhile there are incremental costs to these rollouts, such as payroll and fuel to manage the extra deliveries to surrounding stores, we feel their cost deleverage is relatively modest. Our current assumption on this rollout is that we won't experience meaningful deleverage from this initiative in fiscal 2016. Currently, 5 MegaHubs support approximately 750 surrounding stores. And once built up, we'd expect to have a network of MegaHubs in the neighborhood of 25 to 40 total locations. Like the weekly delivers from our distribution centers, we expect to complete our MegaHub expansion over the next few years.\r\nIn order to support more frequent deliveries to new stores as well as the MegaHubs, we expect to open 2 or 3 domestic distribution centers over the next 2 or 3 years. For your modeling purposes, each new distribution center is expected to cost between $40 million to $45 million. At present, we are in the early stages of planning their openings and don't expect any distribution center to come online in early -- until early fiscal 2017. \r\nFiscal 2016 will incur some capital and operating expenses related to development but a larger portion of the capital we'll spend will be in fiscal 2017 and '18. \r\nWe are very excited to have reached a conclusion on these strategic changes. We had a tremendous amount of AutoZoners who worked this extremely hard and with great discipline. Due to their incredible efforts and patience, we believe we have identified the optimum approach to managing our supply chain. \r\nIn recent years, AutoZone has completed small acquisitions with AutoAnything and IMC. We currently expect our cash from investing in the businesses upcoming year to look similar to this past year. Our capital investments are expected to offset the capital used in the acquisitions.\r\nTo summarize our plans. We expect to roll out more frequent distribution center deliveries and more MegaHub locations over the next few years. We also expect to open 2 or 3 new domestic distribution centers over this time. While our total use of capital will not be materially different than next year from this past, we do expect to incur an approximate 20 to 30 basis point gross margin headwind from these investments alone. This past fiscal year, we faced headwinds to our gross margin, and we were able to overcome them and post improvements in each of our quarters. We believe in fiscal 2016, we have opportunities for improvement but we remain cautious, as we know we'll experience more significant supply chain headwinds. \r\nNow let's turn to our fourth quarter results. Our sales increased 7.9%. Our domestic same-store sales were up 4.5%. This quarter sales results were stronger toward the back half of our fiscal quarter than the beginning. While May was the weakest month of comp store performance, the comparison to the previous year's May was a contributor. May was quite strong the year before. The remaining months were very consistent. We attribute this to consistent weather across much of the country and steadily lower fuel prices. Regionally, the Northeast and the Midwest performed slightly below our overall chain. However, these 2 markets were slightly better the year before. In regard to our 3 primary merchandise category splits, failure-related, maintenance and discretionary, failure performed best, followed closely in growth over last year by maintenance and then discretionary. \r\nWe attribute failure strength to more miles being driven across the country and failure occurring with the vehicle usage in addition to favorable weather. Both traffic and ticket were positive for our DIY and Commercial businesses. We opened 134 new commercial programs in the quarter versus 113 last year. For the year, we opened 296 net programs for the full year, reaching 81% of our domestic store base. Our sales grew 13% on the year. Our programs opened grew by 8%. We are proud of our Commercial results this year, and as our programs continue to mature, we believe our future is bright. \r\nAs part of our strategy on increasing inventory levels in local markets closer to our customers, this past quarter, we opened 3 additional hub locations and now operate 176. As mentioned above regarding opening more MegaHub locations, we do expect to open more standard hub locations as well. Over time, we expect to operate as many as 200 to 225 stores as hubs, but that growth is expected over many years to come. \r\nRegarding Mexico. We opened 23 stores this quarter and now have 441 total locations. While Mexico's U.S. dollar sales were below historic growth rates, we executed well, especially in light of the foreign currency headwinds experienced with the peso. \r\nSales in our other businesses for the quarter were up 2% over last year. As a reminder, our ALLDATA and eCommerce businesses, which include autozone.com and AutoAnything, make up this segment of sales. \r\nRegarding online sales opportunities, there continue to be great opportunities for growth on both a business-to-business basis and to individual customers, or B2C. These businesses are relatively small for us, representing just 3.4% of our total sales mix on the quarter. Overall, we feel like we are well positioned in 2016 to improve on 2015's results. \r\nWith the continued aging of the car population, as we continue to be optimistic regarding trends for our industry in both DIY and DIFM, as new vehicle sales are reaching all-time highs and gas prices, on average, are down year-over-year, miles driven continue to increase. The lower end customer benefits the most from lower gas prices relative to income. This trend is encouraging.\r\nI know with our new fiscal year upon us, many investors have asked about our expectations for 2016. For us, our second and third quarter results are more difficult comparisons. However, we are optimistic we can grow on all of our upcoming quarters. While certain markets outperformed during the winter this past year, others underperformed. We believe we should improve in these regions. As our history has shown, we manage this business focusing on both short-term and long-term performance. And if we felt our sales would be challenged in the short-term due to difficult comparisons, we wouldn't make material changes to our plans or operations. We will continue to balance short-term and long-term performance, and we'll be keenly focused on delivering consistent strong performance and extending our streak of 36 consecutive quarters of double-digit EPS growth.\r\nHowever, with our delivery frequency initiative, along with expanding MegaHubs, we will likely have some headwinds on our operating margin. \r\nNow let me review our highlights regarding execution of our operating theme for 2015: WOW! Every Customer Everywhere. The key priorities for the year were Great People Providing Great Service!, profitably growing our Commercial business, leveraging the Internet, leveraging technology to improve the customer experience while optimizing efficiencies and improving availability. \r\nOn the retail front this past quarter, under the Great People Providing Great Service! theme, we continued with our intense focus on improving execution. We've continually been upgrading our product content in both our electronic catalogs and online offerings. We've also been focused on improving our mobile app to be relevant across our fastest-growing online category. We've been aggressive on our technology investments and believe these initiatives will help differentiate us on a go-forward basis. We believe -- or we realized as customers have become much more tech and mobile savvy, we have to have a sales proposition that touches all the ways they desire to interact with us. Our current and future technology investments will lead to sales growth across all our businesses. \r\nIn regards to Commercial, we opened 134 programs during the quarter. For the year, we opened 296 versus 424 last year. Our expectation is we will continue to open new programs and grow our percentage of stores with the commercial programs, although our pace of growth will likely moderate. \r\nAs we continue to improve our product assortments and availability, and as we make other refinements to our offerings, we expect that the estimated sales potential from the market will grow. Our results continue to provide us confidence to be aggressive in adding additional resources and new programs to this important growth initiative. \r\nWe should also highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital as we were able to finish 2015 at 31.2%. We are very pleased with this metric as it is one of the best in all of Hardlines retail. However, our primarily focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return well in excess of our cost to capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship as the capital we invest is our investors' capital. \r\nBefore I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I'd like to thank and reinforce how proud we are of our entire organization's efforts to manage the business appropriately and prudently. We have an amazing team, and our initiatives for 2016 are very exciting. With our ongoing supply chain initiatives as well as new store openings, we are ready to continue to provide WOW! Customer Service to all of our customers, and we are ready to continue to prudently manage our cost structure providing our shareholders with the consistency we have exhibited in the past. \r\nNow I'll turn it over to Bill Giles.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: William Giles (Executives)】\nThanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our Retail, Commercial and international results for the quarter. \r\nFor the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic Retail and Commercial businesses, our Mexico and Brazil stores and our 20 IMC branches, increased 8.1%. \r\nNow switching to macro trends. During the quarter, nationally, unleaded gas prices started out at $2.69 a gallon and ended the quarter at $2.51 a gallon, an $0.18 decrease. Last year, gas prices decreased $0.21 per gallon during the fourth quarter, starting at $3.67 and ending at $3.46 a gallon. We continue to believe gas prices have a real impact on our customers' ability to maintain their vehicles and cost reductions help all Americans. We hope to continue to benefit from this increase in disposable income. \r\nWe also recognize that the impact of miles driven on cars over 10 years old, the current average, is much different than on newer cars in terms of wear and tear. Miles driven increased 2.6% in May and 3.9% in June. Now we don't have July or August data yet. \r\nThe other statistic we highlight is the number of 7-year-and-older vehicles on the road, which continues to trend in our industry's favor. \r\nFor the trailing 4 quarters, total sales per AutoZone store were $1,761,000. This statistic continues to set the pace for the rest of the industry.\r\nNow for the quarter, total Commercial sales increased 13.1%. In the fourth quarter, Commercial represented 18% of our total sales and grew $70 million over last year's Q4. This past quarter, we opened 134 new programs versus 113 programs opened in our fourth quarter of last fiscal year. We now have our commercial program in 4,141 stores supported by 176 hub stores. Approximately 1,100 of our programs are 3 years old or younger.\r\nLet me take a moment to discuss our Commercial program performance. While our average weekly sales per program for the full year were below some peers in our industry at $8,800, our productivity continues to improve. It's important to highlight that we accelerated our new program growth over the past few years as approximately 26% of our programs are younger than 3 years old. These openings have impacted our average sales metric and cannibalized some of our older programs. However, our focus is on growing market share and improving our service levels by having more programs closer to our customers. \r\nLooking specifically at our mature programs, those at least 5 years old, they averaged $10,000 per week this past year and grew 6.2% over last year. While we will continue to open additional programs over the next several years, we will remain focused on improving the productivity of all our existing programs. We also feel very good about the success we've had in profitably growing the Commercial business, and we like our trajectory here. \r\nWith our inventory additions in support of the IMC acquisition, we are well positioned to grow our base business. Over the last several years, a significant amount of our focus has been on opening new programs and that will continue to be the case albeit at a slightly moderated pace. We have a very talented sales force, and we are enhancing training in introducing additional technology to optimize the productivity of the sales force. We've increased our efforts around analyzing customer purchasing trends and in-stock trends.\r\nIn summary, we remain committed to our long-term growth strategy. We believe we are well positioned to grow this business and capture increased market share, and we believe we can scale this business in a profitable manner. And we continue to be excited about our opportunities in this business for many years to come.\r\nNow moving on to Mexico. Our Mexico stores continued to perform well. We opened 23 new stores during the fourth quarter and 39 for the full year. We currently have 441 stores in Mexico. This upcoming year, we expect to open a similar 40 [ph] new stores, and we are on target to open a new distribution center. This will mark our second DC in the country and support Central Mexico store growth. \r\nWhile sales in base currency were above plan this past year, the devaluation in the peso was much greater than we assumed at the start of the year. The peso devalued 28% over the course of the year. This created a headwind that caused our reported U.S. dollars and EBIT to be lower than last year. The EBIT/dollar impact on the quarter, assuming constant currency with last year's foreign exchange rate, was meaningful, approximately double-digit millions of dollars. While we cannot control movements in functional currency versus planned assumptions, we feel the Mexico leadership did an exceptional job managing the peso-denominated business. \r\nAnd while we hope more favorable currency compares are in our future in fiscal 2016, we know our Mexico AutoZoners will continue to provide outstanding customer service. If the peso stays at these elevated levels, it will continue to pressure our U.S. dollar earnings for the next several quarters. \r\nNow regarding Brazil. We opened no stores in the quarter and had 7 stores opened at the end of the year. Our plans remain to open a few stores this upcoming fiscal 2016. While sales growth has been very encouraging, we have been challenged by weak Brazilian real relative to U.S. dollars as well. While the peso devalued 28%, the real devalued 60% on the year, and we remained in test phase on Brazil, but have been more encouraged of late due to our improved operating performance. \r\nNow recapping this past quarter's performance for the company in total. Our sales were $3,290,000,000, an increase of 7.9% over last year's fourth quarter. Domestic same-store sales or sales for stores opened more than 1 year were up 4.5% for the quarter. \r\nGross margin for the quarter was 52.5% of sales, up 20 basis points. The improvement in gross margin was attributable to higher merchandise margins, partially offset by the impact from higher supply chain costs associated with current year inventory initiatives and Interamerican Motor Corporation, which was acquired in September 2014. \r\nIn regards to inflation. It has been down slightly year-over-year. Currently, we feel costs will be predictable and manageable. We will remain cognizant of future developments regarding inflation, and we'll make the appropriate adjustments should they arise. \r\nLooking forward, we continue to believe there remains opportunity for gross margin expansion within both the Retail and Commercial businesses. But our Commercial business is growing at an accelerated rate and it has lower margins, which is adding pressure to our overall gross margins. It is important to note, we do not manage to target a gross margin percentage. We will also understand the headwinds from expanding our distribution center deliveries will cause. We will work diligently to offset these headwinds with a focus on lower acquisition cost. Our primary focus remains growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total auto parts segment.\r\nSG&A for the quarter was 32.2% of sales, higher by 52 basis points from last year's fourth quarter. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to legal cost, higher legal cost and the impact of the IMC acquisition. The legal cost growth this quarter was attributable to discrete matters that we would not expect to continue. The acquisition of IMC anniversaries this month in September, so we expect a majority of the deleverage to dissipate going forward. We continue to believe we are well positioned to manage our cost structure in response to our sales environment. \r\nEBIT for the quarter was $669 million, up 6.2% over last year's fourth quarter. Our EBIT margin was 20.3%. Interest expense for the quarter was $47.1 million compared with $49.4 million in Q4 a year ago. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $4,625,000,000 or approximately $300 million more than last year's balance of $4,323,000,000. Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.5x EBITDAR. While in any given quarter, we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions. We remain committed to both our investment-grade rating and our capital allocation strategy and share repurchases are an important element of that strategy. \r\nFor the quarter, our tax rate was in line with last year's Q4. We expect our annual rate to be closer to 36.5% on an ongoing basis as the deviation result is primarily driven by the resolution of discrete tax items that arise. \r\nNet income for the quarter was $401 million and up 7.4% over last year. Our diluted share count of 31.5 million was down 5% from last year's fourth quarter. \r\nThe combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $12.75, up 13% over the prior year's fourth quarter. \r\nNow relating to the cash flow statement. For the fourth fiscal quarter, we generated $526 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 6% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $188 million and reflect the additional expenditures required to open 97 new locations this quarter, capital expenditures on existing stores, hub and MegaHub store remodels or openings, work on the development of new stores for upcoming quarters and information technology investments. For all of fiscal 2015, our CapEx was approximately $480 million. With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 5,141 stores in 49 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, 441 stores in Mexico and 7 in Brazil for a total AutoZone store count of 5,589. We also had 20 IMC branches opened at fiscal year end, taking our total locations to 5,609. \r\nDepreciation totaled $87 million for the quarter versus last year's fourth quarter expense of $79 million, in line with recent quarter growth rates. \r\nWith our excess cash flow, we repurchased $430 million of AutoZone stock in the fourth quarter. At year end, we have $348 million remaining under our share buyback authorization, and our leverage metric was 2.5x at year end. Again -- oh, I stress we manage through appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only as each rating firm has its own criteria. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy. \r\nAccounts payable as a percentage of gross inventory finished the quarter at 113%. \r\nNext, I'd like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per-store basis. The company's inventory increased 9% over the same period last year, driven by increased product placement, new stores during the fiscal year and the acquisition of IMC. Inventory per location was $610,000 versus $582,000 last year and $629,000 last quarter. The IMC acquisition increased inventory per location by $15,000 this quarter. \r\nNet inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per-location basis, was a negative $79,000 versus negative $87,000 last year and negative $68,000 in just the last quarter. As a reminder, the addition of IMC has added $15,000 in inventory per location and reduced AP-to-inventory by approximately 2 percentage points. As we will now be anniversary-ing the acquisition, we expect to dramatically reduce pressure on these overall metrics going forward. \r\nFinally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing 4 quarters of 31.2%. We have and we'll continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital. \r\nNow I'll turn it back to Bill Rhodes.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nThanks, Bill. We are pleased to report our 36th consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth and for the year to report an EPS growth rate of 14.1%. We also surpassed an historic milestone in 2015, exceeding $10 billion in sales for the first time in our company's rich history. Our companies continue to be successful over the long run. That success is attributable to our approach of leveraging our unique and powerful culture and focusing on the needs of our customers. \r\nTo execute at a high level, we have to consistently adhere to living the pledge. We cannot and will not take our eye off of execution. While we study the external environment and react where appropriate, we must stay committed to executing day in and day out on our game plan. Success will be achieved with an attention to detail and exceptional execution. \r\nBefore I conclude, I want to take this opportunity to reflect on fiscal 2015. We were able to build on past accomplishments and deliver some impressive results. In recognition of the dedication, passion and commitment of our AutoZoners, I want to highlight that we grew sales to a record $10.2 billion this past year and we grew same-store sales at 3.8%. We grew our store base in Mexico and managed our expenses exceptionally well in spite of the foreign currency headwind with the peso. We began our IMC integration, opened 3 new branches and now have 20 locations. With a minority of our AutoZone stores today able to sell IMC products, we feel we are well positioned to expand this business in the future. Our inventory availability testing and MegaHubs store remodels helped us to reach our conclusion and allowed us to announce our planned implementation schedule. I could not be more proud of the tremendous work everyone on this project contributed. \r\nAnd lastly, we will talk more about saying, yes, we've got it, to our customers. We are fixated on making sure we meet our customers' needs in 2016. Our offerings are the best they have ever been, and we are determined to communicate this to our customer base. At the end of the day, our customers have choices, and we must exceed their expectation. \r\nAgain, we are excited about our initiatives around inventory assortment and availability, hub stores, commercial growth, Mexico, ALLDATA, e-commerce, Brazil and IMC. Our long-term model is to grow new store square footage at a low single-digit growth rate, and we expect to continue growing our Commercial business at an accelerated rate. Therefore, we look to routinely grow EBIT dollars in the mid-single-digit range or better in times of strength. And we'll leverage our very strong and predictable cash flow to repurchase shares, enhancing our earnings per share growth into double digits. \r\nWe feel the track we are on will allow us to continue winning for the long run. We believe our steady, consistent strategy is correct. It is the attention to details and consistent execution that will matter. Our belief is solid, consistent strategy combined with superior execution is a formula for success. \r\nOur charge remains to optimize our performance regardless of market conditions and continue to ensure we are investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance. In the end, delivering strong EPS growth and ROIC each and every quarter is how we measure ourselves. We are pleased with our results this past year, but we must remain committed to delivering on our strategic and financial objectives. \r\nI can't wait to sit down and talk to our leadership team at our upcoming national sales meeting. This team is comprised of the best leaders in our industry. We are launching our Live The Pledge theme, and I know our leaders, combined with our talented team of roughly 80,000 AutoZoners, will do just that. \r\nNow we'd like to open up the call for questions.",
      "transcript_text3": "My first question is regarding the new distribution strategy. Obviously, you guys have worked really hard to test it. You now plan to roll it out. Just trying to better understand the return dynamics and the financial implications here. So, previously you had stated that you expect about a $1,000 to $1,500 per week lift per store when all is said and done from this initiative. I want to confirm that's still on target.\n\n---\n\nYes, I will start with that $1,000 to $1,500 per store is the target when both -- when they get both initiatives. Now I said in our prepared comments that about 1/3 of the stores will not receive more frequent delivery. And so some piece of that will not flow through to them. But on stores that get both the MegaHub and the increased frequency of delivery, it will be in a range of $1,000 to $1,500. It's a little tough still at this point to narrow that range. There's just a lot of variability depending on a lot -- many different factors.\n\n---\n\nGot it. So as you roll this out to 1,000 stores next year, about 20% of your base, it would appear that on a run-rate basis, that should be driving -- boost the comps between 75 and 100 basis points. At the same time, you'll be experiencing some gross margin pressure, about 25 basis points. But that looks like a pretty good trade-off in my book. It looks like you'll be growing gross profit dollars from this initiative around $50 million next year on a run rate basis versus about $25 million of gross profit -- or expense associated with the rollout. That's a pretty good return. Is that the right way to think about it?\n\n---\n\nWell, you did a lot of really good math there very quickly, much quicker than I can do it. I think generically speaking, you're in the ballpark. And we're not going to go forward with these initiatives unless we think they're going to provide us with a growth in operating profit dollars that exceeds our return metrics. And we think that both of these initiatives will do that. Now we didn't think that it would do it in the lowest-volume stores, which is why we're not going to roll it to those stores at this point in time.\n\n---\n\nI just wondered more specifically on the quarter and then I had a question about the successful past [ph]. For the comp during the quarter, can you talk a little bit about how you did compared to your plan and if there was a -- back to your plan, where did it come from?\n\n---\n\nI think generally speaking, that performance versus our plan was pretty much on track, particularly in the Retail business. Frankly, we had a pretty aggressive plan in fourth quarter that we were a little bit daunted about coming into the quarter. May was very soft and we were behind. But June, July and August outperformed and generally ended on plan.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And my second question is just on some of your commentary around your DC build-outs and opportunities for new store growth. How should we think about that from a location standpoint? Where are you aiming to build out new stores? And with regard to DCs, where could they be located? And are you considering where they're located in relation to how your competitors' supply chains plan out?\n\n---\n\nSure. As far as -- today, we have distribution centers that can service our current strategy really anywhere in the United States. We're not prepared yet to talk about specifically where these next 2 to 3 distribution centers are. We still have some work to do. But  we can service every store today. The reason we need to expand it is, one, as we continue to grow our store count, we need more capacity in our supply chain; and then secondly, as we move to increase frequency of deliveries, we need to have some distribution centers that are closer in certain parts of the country. And that's what we'll be solving with these extra 2 to 3 distribution centers.\n\n---\n\nFollowing up on Seth's question regarding, I guess, some of the margin trajectory going forward, Bill, you said some of these investments will weigh on margins. You quantified the 25 bps from the multiple delivery, and I think you said very modest deleverage from -- on the SG&A line from DCs. In all, it doesn't seem like a big amount this quarter. I think you had that run rate, and x some of those currency headwinds and legal, you would have seen margins, if not up, at least flattish. So my question is, did -- is there a specific outlook on the margin side? It feels like margin could still go up even with that 25 basis point headwind. Do you agree? Or are you just trying to just take a cautious outlook ahead of the rollout?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think the way I would answer that is that we wanted to carve out at least what the impact was of the initiative very specifically. So we said that, that was 20 to 30 basis points. A majority of that is in gross margin, as you highlighted. A little bit of that would be on SG&A to support the MegaHub operational activities. And frankly, you're right, we had about a 24 basis point impact on the supply chain for this past quarter, which is probably a pretty good way to look at it for the next several quarters as we continue to roll out stores. Now separate and distinct from that, our merchandising organization has done a terrific job in lowering acquisition costs, doing some price optimization, and they've done a very good job in offsetting those costs. So I think there are other opportunities for us to continue to improve gross margin rates, but we can clearly identify and quantify the investments and we wanted to highlight those for you. But I think as we look at -- out over the year, we feel pretty good about overall margin rates. But clearly, we'll have some headwinds.\n\n---\n\nOkay. My follow-up on the tests, on the multiple delivery tests or the stores that you've been operating for a year. Can you just give a little more color about the traction you're seeing? Bill Rhodes mentioned, saying yes, more frequent. Are you growing the basket with the existing customer? Are you moving up on the call list? Are you getting new customers that wouldn't -- that didn't previously do business? Can you just -- a little more color on, so we can appreciate the curve of improvement after the rollout is ongoing.\n\n---\n\nYes, I would say that, number one, we are seeing the benefit in both our Retail and Commercial businesses. We've been very pleased with the performance to date. Now this is -- you have to remember, this is slower-moving inventory. So when they call us and we have it, you can get the sale pretty much immediately. So we haven't seen a big ramp in what has happened over time. I do hope and expect over time with our commercial customers, the more frequently we say yes, the more we'll move up their call list. That's all on increased frequency of delivery. Regarding MegaHubs, that is a substantial, different offering we've ever had in the marketplace. And I think us being able to surprise and delight our commercials, both Retail and Commercial, that, that's beginning to build traction over time.\n\n---\n\nSo when you think about the eventual distribution network of 11 DCs and 40 MegaHubs, AutoZone's capital investment in distribution will still be less than half of competitors' such as O'Reilly and NAPA. When you think about the endgame a few years out, how will the parts coverage compare to those competitors? We know it'd be significantly better than what AutoZone has had in the past. But if you were to benchmark it against those competitors that made the much larger investment, what will be the difference?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think we'll be at the top of the heap in the industry with access to inventory. Certainly, when we have frequency of delivery at 3 to 5x a week, we will be able to close out those in-stocks. When you think about it, you're trying to solve 2 different problems. One is an in-stock problem where you have very low demand. And when it spikes, if you don't have an increased frequency of delivery, you're out of business for 8 days. We believe this 10 to 11 distribution center model will allow us to do that at the optimum level. That does not mean that we won't forgo a few sales here and there. But we want to make sure that we get a return on the investment that we're making that is sufficient for our expectations. And secondly, with the MegaHub, you're trying to solve expanded parts only. And by putting these 25 to 40 MegaHubs in the markets, we're going to significantly increase the local market availability of products to 80,000 to 100,000 SKUs. That helps both our Retail customer and our Commercial customer on a same-day basis in those markets. And then on an overnight basis, it'll go to other hub stores, which I think is best-in-class solution.\n\n---\n\nSo if you think about the potential for an extra $1,500 of revenues per week per program where both of the initiatives are in place, your Commercial run rate is still about $200,000 less per program, let's say, compared to O'Reilly. Is the difference the fact that it's going to take a multiple number of years for your customers to recognize that your capabilities are greater? Or are we not factoring in that perhaps there's going to be a need for a larger number of salespeople at AutoZone? But I would think that the upside could actually be more than the $1,500 that you were suggesting.\n\n---\n\nWell, first of all, we said $1,000 to $1,500, Dan. But I appreciate your optimism. And I hope you're right, too. I hope the upside is more than that. Our testing hasn't proven that out yet. But as I mentioned a few minutes ago, over time, the more you say yes to your Commercial customers, especially on hard-to-find parts, the more confidence they're going to get from -- with you, and there could potentially be a halo effect over the long term. Look, this is a significant improvement for us. But it's not a silver bullet. We still have to continue to refine the way we go to market to make sure we have the right product offerings, to make sure that we have the best sales force, which I think we do, and on and on. It's going to take us some time. But we are closing those gaps even as we speak.\n\n---\n\nBill, as you look out at the industry over the next few months, you look -- it seems like the low gas prices are here to stay. The weather could be unique given some of the predictions that are out there. So what do you think's going to have a greater influence on demand for the industry? Gas prices or the weather over the next few months?\n\n---\n\nI would say that from a consistency perspective, I think the gas prices have clearly done a couple of things for us, one of which is it has increased disposable income particularly for our customer. And it also seems to have attributed to increase in miles driven, and we're seeing some miles driven numbers that are historically very high relative to anything we've seen in the past. And so I think those 2 things, which can increase wear and tear on automobiles, those are the -- and the age of the vehicles, those 3 factors, I think, are probably going to help support demand for the industry for -- over the long term. The weather, you may be right, it's very hard to predict for us. Obviously, we had some favorability this fourth quarter, particularly towards the end. But that's really difficult for us to predict and forecast, and we'll just have to see it as it comes. But on the other ones, I think that those really are favorable underlying trends for the health of the industry.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then following up on the inventory strategy that you're pursuing. I think the market has come to expect a lot of flexibility in your cost structure, where as sales gyrate from quarter to quarter, you're still able to produce the type of earnings that you have. Do the -- does the new inventory strategy reduce that flexibility such that if the sales don't come through, the margin performance could be more at risk?\n\n---\n\nI guess theoretically, that's probably true because we're adding some increased fixed cost structure to the organization. But at the same time, as you pointed out, we've been very good at determining how to manage our overall cost structure given the environment that we're dealing with. Having said that, we're committed to this initiative, and we're very encouraged by it and we're going to see it through.\n\n---\n\nOkay. A last quick one. A few years ago, you were decreasing your share count year-over-year by a high single-digit pace that's moderated into a more -- more like a mid-single-digit pace. Is that the reasonable rate to expect moving forward?\n\n---\n\nI think so. I mean, it's obviously P/E -- dependent on the P/E. So as our P/E has gone up, obviously our share repurchase as a percent has declined, as you said, to mid-, high single digit to, just this past quarter, 5%. So it's going to continue to be a very important part of our capital allocation strategy, and it's going to be a very key element of us driving EPS growth. We've got a nice balance of organic EBIT growth and share repurchase to drive EPS, and I expect that to continue in the future.\n\n---\n\nMy first question relates to this quarter, and I'm just trying to understand some of the improvement. It looks like Commercial saw more acceleration. And, Bill, you gave us that 6.2% increase from mature programs. Can you tell us how that 6.2% compare to what you had done over the prior quarter or 2? And to what degree do you think the improvement you generated in Commercial? Is it all a function of some of the early testing and rollouts that you've been implementing on the inventory and hub side?\n\n---\n\nI'd say the 6.2% is probably a bit of an acceleration. And as we highlighted, that's on our mature programs. So we've seen a little bit of acceleration on that. And with some of the other questions we were going through on Commercial, some of that relates to some of the things that we've done around inventory availability and inventory initiatives. But keep in mind, we've got several initiatives in our Commercial programs, and we've got a lot of things that we're working on in order to continue to drive that average weekly sale or average dollars per program every day. So it's not just inventory availability initiatives, although that's been helpful.\n\n---\n\nGreat. Second question. As we model out the gross margin or the aggregate margin impact of the supply chain investments, you spoke about approximately 25 basis points year-on-year. Is that 25 basis points each year incremental to the prior year until the rollout is essentially done?\n\n---\n\nTheoretically, yes, although my guess is that as we get past 1 year or 18 months, that we'll be able to dissipate some of that impact with improved sales performance and other tactics to improve margin rates.\n\n---\n\nGot it. And then finally, as you think about the incremental inventory, I know the dollars are not huge. To the extent that Bill Rhodes alluded to it as slow-turning inventory, to what degree do you think vendors are going to be able to carry that for you as attainable relative to the base?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think that's a good question. I think right now, we're at a 1.5x turn. And so if we can kind of keep it around that number, I think the vendors should be able to support our AP-inventory ratio where it is.\n\n---\n\nI have sort of some housekeeping and a strategic question. But first, on the housekeeping. If I got it right, the CapEx is probably going to go up to around $600 million if you factor in M&A. But then, it should build in a little more into 2017 given that's when the DCs will actually open. Did we get that right? Did I get that right on the cash flow side?\n\n---\n\nYes, Greg, I think you're pretty close on that on the $600 million or maybe a little bit of an increase over that. We'll have a little bit of DC dollars in '16 but more in '17.\n\n---\n\nOkay, great. And then I just want to make sure. On the strategic side, on the prepared comments, I heard you guys mention the new hard parts placement techniques, and I assume that's all part of the MegaHubs and the expanded availability. But what is -- is that all that is? Or is there something else going on there? It sounded like it might a new software system or algorithms you run to figure out where to put those parts. Or am I reading too much into that?\n\n---\n\nYes, Greg, maybe -- I'm sorry, we weren't clear enough. That's the work that we did 1 year, 1.5 years ago where we updated the algorithms to place -- forward-place the inventory with a slant towards newer merchandise, newer life cycle-of-vehicle merchandise. So that work has been done for about a year now, and it's worked very well. Now we're using those same methodologies to assort our MegaHubs. And as we continue to roll those out, we'll leverage that methodology there.\n\n---\n\nGot it. And then as part of that, that 21,000 SKUs per store, it sounds like as this plays itself out with more daily replenishment, your plan is not to change that. That would have been shifted a couple of years ago with these algorithms. This is now just making sure you're in stock faster?\n\n---\n\nThat is exactly correct. We will -- we'll modify our SKU count by category every time we do a category update. But the step function change in what we are going to stock in a store has been done. Now we're going to make a step function change in 70% of the stores on how frequently they receive their replenishment orders.\n\n---\n\nAnd then lastly, if I could follow up on that. How does this change? You've always had a very strong private label program. And if you built these brands, Duralast in particular, how does the shift affect that if we think out 3, 4, 5 years?\n\n---\n\nYes, great question. It will have 0 bearing on our merchandise strategy and branding strategy. Duralast has been a terrific strategy for us and it will continue to be so.\n\n---\n\nSo I wanted to -- from an understanding perspective, what are the buckets of higher fixed costs associated with the new -- with the inventory initiatives? And perhaps any quantification of how much your cost structure will become more fixed over time maybe as a percentage of total -- from a percentage of total cost perspective?\n\n---\n\nWell, I got 2 things going on, one of which is that we'll open 3 distribution centers over the next several years. So that will increase the cost structure. We believe that obviously placing those distribution centers will reduce our transportation costs. So hopefully that will offset it. And then there will be some increased transportation equipment, if you will, tractors and trailers, in order to increase delivery frequencies. So those are the costs. They're not overly significant, but you're adding some capital into the equation.\n\n---\n\nAnd then from an ability to be flexible in terms of the rollout with the MegaHubs and the increased frequency of delivery, is that something that can -- you could perhaps accelerate more quickly if you saw more success? And then on the other side, if the environment weakened, is there an ability to dial those back?\n\n---\n\nOn the margin, absolutely. But obviously, there's a lot of work involved in increasing the delivery. Like I said, there's transportation equipment required, people required. And then the same on the MegaHubs, we've got to find the real estate and expand the locations or create a new location. So there's some lead time in being able to do this and being able to do it in an efficient and profitable manner.\n\n---\n\nAnd then last question in case I missed it. Did you mention how many stores currently have both MegaHub and increased frequency? And how do you think about the percentages of stores that will have those long term?\n\n---\n\nYes, we specifically said we've got about 900 stores on increased frequency of delivery. And from our 5 MegaHubs, we have about 750 stores that are being serviced by those. We -- I don't even know off the top of my head how many of them have both. Over the long run, about 70% are going to have increased frequency of delivery, and the majority of the stores are going to have MegaHubs. But ones that are in remote locations or small-volume stores won't have either one of those.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Before we conclude the call, I'd just like to take a moment to reiterate that our business model continues to be very solid. We're excited about our growth prospects for the year. We will not take anything for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives. We have a solid plan to succeed this fiscal year, but I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long-term shareholder value, we are confident AutoZone will continue to be very successful. We thank you for participating in today's call.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Seth Basham (Analysts)】\nMy first question is regarding the new distribution strategy. Obviously, you guys have worked really hard to test it. You now plan to roll it out. Just trying to better understand the return dynamics and the financial implications here. So, previously you had stated that you expect about a $1,000 to $1,500 per week lift per store when all is said and done from this initiative. I want to confirm that's still on target.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nYes, I will start with that $1,000 to $1,500 per store is the target when both -- when they get both initiatives. Now I said in our prepared comments that about 1/3 of the stores will not receive more frequent delivery. And so some piece of that will not flow through to them. But on stores that get both the MegaHub and the increased frequency of delivery, it will be in a range of $1,000 to $1,500. It's a little tough still at this point to narrow that range. There's just a lot of variability depending on a lot -- many different factors.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Seth Basham (Analysts)】\nGot it. So as you roll this out to 1,000 stores next year, about 20% of your base, it would appear that on a run-rate basis, that should be driving -- boost the comps between 75 and 100 basis points. At the same time, you'll be experiencing some gross margin pressure, about 25 basis points. But that looks like a pretty good trade-off in my book. It looks like you'll be growing gross profit dollars from this initiative around $50 million next year on a run rate basis versus about $25 million of gross profit -- or expense associated with the rollout. That's a pretty good return. Is that the right way to think about it?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nWell, you did a lot of really good math there very quickly, much quicker than I can do it. I think generically speaking, you're in the ballpark. And we're not going to go forward with these initiatives unless we think they're going to provide us with a growth in operating profit dollars that exceeds our return metrics. And we think that both of these initiatives will do that. Now we didn't think that it would do it in the lowest-volume stores, which is why we're not going to roll it to those stores at this point in time.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kate McShane (Analysts)】\nI just wondered more specifically on the quarter and then I had a question about the successful past [ph]. For the comp during the quarter, can you talk a little bit about how you did compared to your plan and if there was a -- back to your plan, where did it come from?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nI think generally speaking, that performance versus our plan was pretty much on track, particularly in the Retail business. Frankly, we had a pretty aggressive plan in fourth quarter that we were a little bit daunted about coming into the quarter. May was very soft and we were behind. But June, July and August outperformed and generally ended on plan.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kate McShane (Analysts)】\nOkay. And my second question is just on some of your commentary around your DC build-outs and opportunities for new store growth. How should we think about that from a location standpoint? Where are you aiming to build out new stores? And with regard to DCs, where could they be located? And are you considering where they're located in relation to how your competitors' supply chains plan out?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nSure. As far as -- today, we have distribution centers that can service our current strategy really anywhere in the United States. We're not prepared yet to talk about specifically where these next 2 to 3 distribution centers are. We still have some work to do. But  we can service every store today. The reason we need to expand it is, one, as we continue to grow our store count, we need more capacity in our supply chain; and then secondly, as we move to increase frequency of deliveries, we need to have some distribution centers that are closer in certain parts of the country. And that's what we'll be solving with these extra 2 to 3 distribution centers.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Simeon Gutman (Analysts)】\nFollowing up on Seth's question regarding, I guess, some of the margin trajectory going forward, Bill, you said some of these investments will weigh on margins. You quantified the 25 bps from the multiple delivery, and I think you said very modest deleverage from -- on the SG&A line from DCs. In all, it doesn't seem like a big amount this quarter. I think you had that run rate, and x some of those currency headwinds and legal, you would have seen margins, if not up, at least flattish. So my question is, did -- is there a specific outlook on the margin side? It feels like margin could still go up even with that 25 basis point headwind. Do you agree? Or are you just trying to just take a cautious outlook ahead of the rollout?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Giles (Executives)】\nYes, I think the way I would answer that is that we wanted to carve out at least what the impact was of the initiative very specifically. So we said that, that was 20 to 30 basis points. A majority of that is in gross margin, as you highlighted. A little bit of that would be on SG&A to support the MegaHub operational activities. And frankly, you're right, we had about a 24 basis point impact on the supply chain for this past quarter, which is probably a pretty good way to look at it for the next several quarters as we continue to roll out stores. Now separate and distinct from that, our merchandising organization has done a terrific job in lowering acquisition costs, doing some price optimization, and they've done a very good job in offsetting those costs. So I think there are other opportunities for us to continue to improve gross margin rates, but we can clearly identify and quantify the investments and we wanted to highlight those for you. But I think as we look at -- out over the year, we feel pretty good about overall margin rates. But clearly, we'll have some headwinds.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Simeon Gutman (Analysts)】\nOkay. My follow-up on the tests, on the multiple delivery tests or the stores that you've been operating for a year. Can you just give a little more color about the traction you're seeing? Bill Rhodes mentioned, saying yes, more frequent. Are you growing the basket with the existing customer? Are you moving up on the call list? Are you getting new customers that wouldn't -- that didn't previously do business? Can you just -- a little more color on, so we can appreciate the curve of improvement after the rollout is ongoing.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nYes, I would say that, number one, we are seeing the benefit in both our Retail and Commercial businesses. We've been very pleased with the performance to date. Now this is -- you have to remember, this is slower-moving inventory. So when they call us and we have it, you can get the sale pretty much immediately. So we haven't seen a big ramp in what has happened over time. I do hope and expect over time with our commercial customers, the more frequently we say yes, the more we'll move up their call list. That's all on increased frequency of delivery. Regarding MegaHubs, that is a substantial, different offering we've ever had in the marketplace. And I think us being able to surprise and delight our commercials, both Retail and Commercial, that, that's beginning to build traction over time.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Wewer (Analysts)】\nSo when you think about the eventual distribution network of 11 DCs and 40 MegaHubs, AutoZone's capital investment in distribution will still be less than half of competitors' such as O'Reilly and NAPA. When you think about the endgame a few years out, how will the parts coverage compare to those competitors? We know it'd be significantly better than what AutoZone has had in the past. But if you were to benchmark it against those competitors that made the much larger investment, what will be the difference?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nYes, I think we'll be at the top of the heap in the industry with access to inventory. Certainly, when we have frequency of delivery at 3 to 5x a week, we will be able to close out those in-stocks. When you think about it, you're trying to solve 2 different problems. One is an in-stock problem where you have very low demand. And when it spikes, if you don't have an increased frequency of delivery, you're out of business for 8 days. We believe this 10 to 11 distribution center model will allow us to do that at the optimum level. That does not mean that we won't forgo a few sales here and there. But we want to make sure that we get a return on the investment that we're making that is sufficient for our expectations. And secondly, with the MegaHub, you're trying to solve expanded parts only. And by putting these 25 to 40 MegaHubs in the markets, we're going to significantly increase the local market availability of products to 80,000 to 100,000 SKUs. That helps both our Retail customer and our Commercial customer on a same-day basis in those markets. And then on an overnight basis, it'll go to other hub stores, which I think is best-in-class solution.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Wewer (Analysts)】\nSo if you think about the potential for an extra $1,500 of revenues per week per program where both of the initiatives are in place, your Commercial run rate is still about $200,000 less per program, let's say, compared to O'Reilly. Is the difference the fact that it's going to take a multiple number of years for your customers to recognize that your capabilities are greater? Or are we not factoring in that perhaps there's going to be a need for a larger number of salespeople at AutoZone? But I would think that the upside could actually be more than the $1,500 that you were suggesting.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nWell, first of all, we said $1,000 to $1,500, Dan. But I appreciate your optimism. And I hope you're right, too. I hope the upside is more than that. Our testing hasn't proven that out yet. But as I mentioned a few minutes ago, over time, the more you say yes to your Commercial customers, especially on hard-to-find parts, the more confidence they're going to get from -- with you, and there could potentially be a halo effect over the long term. Look, this is a significant improvement for us. But it's not a silver bullet. We still have to continue to refine the way we go to market to make sure we have the right product offerings, to make sure that we have the best sales force, which I think we do, and on and on. It's going to take us some time. But we are closing those gaps even as we speak.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Lasser (Analysts)】\nBill, as you look out at the industry over the next few months, you look -- it seems like the low gas prices are here to stay. The weather could be unique given some of the predictions that are out there. So what do you think's going to have a greater influence on demand for the industry? Gas prices or the weather over the next few months?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Giles (Executives)】\nI would say that from a consistency perspective, I think the gas prices have clearly done a couple of things for us, one of which is it has increased disposable income particularly for our customer. And it also seems to have attributed to increase in miles driven, and we're seeing some miles driven numbers that are historically very high relative to anything we've seen in the past. And so I think those 2 things, which can increase wear and tear on automobiles, those are the -- and the age of the vehicles, those 3 factors, I think, are probably going to help support demand for the industry for -- over the long term. The weather, you may be right, it's very hard to predict for us. Obviously, we had some favorability this fourth quarter, particularly towards the end. But that's really difficult for us to predict and forecast, and we'll just have to see it as it comes. But on the other ones, I think that those really are favorable underlying trends for the health of the industry.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Lasser (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then following up on the inventory strategy that you're pursuing. I think the market has come to expect a lot of flexibility in your cost structure, where as sales gyrate from quarter to quarter, you're still able to produce the type of earnings that you have. Do the -- does the new inventory strategy reduce that flexibility such that if the sales don't come through, the margin performance could be more at risk?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Giles (Executives)】\nI guess theoretically, that's probably true because we're adding some increased fixed cost structure to the organization. But at the same time, as you pointed out, we've been very good at determining how to manage our overall cost structure given the environment that we're dealing with. Having said that, we're committed to this initiative, and we're very encouraged by it and we're going to see it through.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Lasser (Analysts)】\nOkay. A last quick one. A few years ago, you were decreasing your share count year-over-year by a high single-digit pace that's moderated into a more -- more like a mid-single-digit pace. Is that the reasonable rate to expect moving forward?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Giles (Executives)】\nI think so. I mean, it's obviously P/E -- dependent on the P/E. So as our P/E has gone up, obviously our share repurchase as a percent has declined, as you said, to mid-, high single digit to, just this past quarter, 5%. So it's going to continue to be a very important part of our capital allocation strategy, and it's going to be a very key element of us driving EPS growth. We've got a nice balance of organic EBIT growth and share repurchase to drive EPS, and I expect that to continue in the future.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matthew Fassler (Analysts)】\nMy first question relates to this quarter, and I'm just trying to understand some of the improvement. It looks like Commercial saw more acceleration. And, Bill, you gave us that 6.2% increase from mature programs. Can you tell us how that 6.2% compare to what you had done over the prior quarter or 2? And to what degree do you think the improvement you generated in Commercial? Is it all a function of some of the early testing and rollouts that you've been implementing on the inventory and hub side?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Giles (Executives)】\nI'd say the 6.2% is probably a bit of an acceleration. And as we highlighted, that's on our mature programs. So we've seen a little bit of acceleration on that. And with some of the other questions we were going through on Commercial, some of that relates to some of the things that we've done around inventory availability and inventory initiatives. But keep in mind, we've got several initiatives in our Commercial programs, and we've got a lot of things that we're working on in order to continue to drive that average weekly sale or average dollars per program every day. So it's not just inventory availability initiatives, although that's been helpful.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matthew Fassler (Analysts)】\nGreat. Second question.

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you, Mike. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss the divestiture of H&R Block Bank, our capital structure plans and our first quarter fiscal 2016 results.\r\nJoining me on the call today are Bill Cobb, our President and CEO; and Greg Macfarlane, our CFO.\r\nIn connection with this call, we have posted today's press releases on the Investor Relations website at hrblock.com. Some of the figures that we'll discuss today are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We've reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP figures in the schedules attached to our press release.\r\nBefore we begin our prepared remarks, I'd like to remind everyone that this call will include forward-looking statements as defined under the securities laws. Such statements are based on current information and management's expectations as of this date and are not guarantees of future performance. Forward-looking statements involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. As a result, our actual outcomes and results could differ materially. You can learn more about these risks in our Form 10-K for fiscal 2015 and our other SEC filings. H&R Block undertakes no obligation to publicly update these risk factors or forward-looking statements.\r\nAt the conclusion of our prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session.\r\nAnd with that, I'll now turn the call over to Bill.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Colby, and good afternoon, everyone. This is a big day for H&R Block and represents a significant milestone during my tenure as CEO. We've put in a lot of hard work to get to this point, and I'm excited about what today's announcement means for our company and our shareholders. The 4 key elements of our announcement include the following: First, we have now closed the H&R Block Bank divestiture transaction, and H&R Block is no longer regulated as a savings and loan holding company; second, we are implementing a new capital structure plan, highlighted by a $3.5 billion share repurchase program; third, we are taking immediate action toward establishing this new structure as we plan to commence a modified Dutch auction tender offer tomorrow, September 2, to repurchase up to $1.5 billion of our common stock, which represents approximately 16% of the company's current market capitalization; and finally, we are updating our debt and liquidity profile and intend to take on incremental debt and replace our committed line of credit within the confines of maintaining investment-grade ratings metrics.\r\nThe capital structure we are implementing positions us to deliver meaningful returns to our shareholders while maintaining the appropriate access to liquidity given the seasonal nature of our business. This is an important step in the journey we embarked on 4 years ago that has been focused on creating value for our shareholders.\r\nWe're going to use today's call to walk through a number of specifics regarding these announcements. Oh, and by the way, we are also going to talk briefly about the first quarter results for fiscal year 2016, which ended July 31.\r\nStarting with the bank divestiture. I'm pleased to announce that we've reached the final milestone in our efforts to divest our bank and cease being regulated as a savings and loan holding company. Yesterday H&R Block, Inc., H&R Block Bank and BofI Federal Bank closed the definitive purchase and assumption agreement and related agreements a full month earlier than expected and previously announced. This is the final step in our multiyear effort to return back to our core business of providing the best tax preparation and related services to our clients. We believe that this transaction provides real value to you, our shareholders, by giving us control over our financial structure. As many of you know, H&R Block is an incredibly efficient user of capital, and this change facilitates our ability to continue this practice.\r\nUnder the agreement, H&R Block Bank sold certain assets and transferred certain liabilities, including all of its deposit liabilities to BofI. The parties also executed a program management agreement forming a long-term relationship in which BofI will offer core financial services products: the Emerald Advance line of credit, Refund Transfers and the award-winning general purpose reloadable debit card, the Emerald Prepaid MasterCard, to H&R Block clients.\r\nWe are also pleased that we have completed the steps required to allow us to cease being regulated as a savings and loan holding company. H&R Block Bank has merged into its parent company, surrendered its bank charter and H&R Block, Inc. is now officially deregistered as a savings and loan holding company. Further details of these events can be found in our Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission today and in previous public disclosures.\r\nWith the bank divestiture behind us, it seems appropriate to put some context around not only our decision to divest the bank but the journey we've been on as a company over the last several years. As a reminder, the divestiture of our bank represents the final step in a multiyear effort to focus on our core purpose, which is to look at our clients' lives through the lens of tax and find ways to help. The divestiture also allows us to regain flexibility in our capital structure, where we have a strong tradition of returning capital to shareholders, having repurchased 12% of the company's stock and increased our dividend 33% during my tenure to-date.\r\nFrom an operational perspective, we have also brought more discipline to the organization, stabilizing the management team and creating a clearer vision. We divested non-core businesses and successfully navigated through the largest change to the tax code in decades, the Affordable Care Act. This focus on our Tax Plus strategy has resulted in revenue increases in each of the last 3 fiscal years and a considerable increase in our margins over that same period.\r\nThe net result for our shareholders has been a significant increase in value with our market capitalization more than doubling. This value creation was accomplished while regulation related to the Dodd-Frank Act required H&R Block as a savings and loan holding company to maintain levels of capital that are not appropriate for a capital-light retail consumer services business such as ours. Now that we are out from under these regulatory constraints, we are putting into place a capital structure plan that shows a strong commitment to and excitement about H&R Block's opportunities, with a goal of building sustainable medium and long-term value for you, our shareholders. This capital structure plan recognizes the fact that our balance sheet was restricted and strikes an appropriate balance in how we capitalize our business going forward.\r\nTo that end, we are now taking decisive, thoughtful and immediate steps to achieving this capital plan. First, I'm very pleased that the board has approved a new $3.5 billion share repurchase program. Given our current market capitalization of approximately $9 billion, this is a bold and aggressive move toward our future. Next, as part of this program, we intend to commence a modified Dutch auction tender offer tomorrow to repurchase up to $1.5 billion of common stock, which represents approximately 16% of the company's current market capitalization. Finally, we announced our intention to raise incremental debt and put into place a new line of credit. These new debt instruments will allow us the ability to return capital to our shareholders and fund our seasonal liquidity needs, all while maintaining investment-grade ratings metrics.\r\nIt's taken a lot of work to get to this point, and I'm appreciative of the support and patience that you, our shareholders, have shown. We believe that this plan will provide the appropriate reward for that patience and will get us back to managing the financial architecture and operations of the business in the most optimal way possible. Greg will provide further details during his prepared remarks.\r\nBut before turning the call over to Greg, I'd like to provide a few thoughts regarding our plans for the upcoming tax season. Following a solid year in 2015 where we achieved our third consecutive year of revenue growth, navigated the first year of the ACA and successfully launched our new product, Tax Identity Shield, we are excited about our plans to deliver a successful tax season in 2016 for our clients and shareholders. As we head into the second year of the ACA, increased documentation requirements, higher health care marketplace enrollment and larger penalties will result in an increase in the number of people impacted by the ACA. As we have consistently said, this is the largest change to the tax code in decades, and it will take several years for taxpayer behaviors and thus, the full impact of the change to be realized. Once again, we will be ready to assist our clients in understanding what the ACA means to them.\r\nWe have also continued this summer in our work to advocate for taxpayers as we lead the industry's efforts to stem fraud in the tax industry. We are working with other tax preparation companies, the IRS and State departments of revenue to implement stronger fraud prevention measures prior to the start of the next tax season. And in addition to these efforts, we are fully focused on a seamless transition to BofI for our clients. We consider this to be a key element of a successful 2016 tax season and are committing resources necessary to facilitate a smooth transition. We do not expect significant changes to existing products, and our operational teams are working closely with BofI to implement the necessary processes. These efforts will allow us to continue providing consistent, best-in-class financial services products to our clients who trust our brand.\r\nIn conclusion, I'm excited about the upcoming tax season and about the future of H&R Block. We are moving forward with an appropriate capital structure and have solid plans in place to execute on our Tax Plus strategy. I look forward to sharing more about these plans with you at our Investor Conference later this year.\r\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Greg.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Bill, and good afternoon, everybody. Before I get into our capital structure plans, let me provide a few comments on the just-completed fiscal first quarter. And as a reminder, due to the seasonal nature of our business, these results are not indicative of our performance for the full year.\r\nNet loss from continuing operations was $97 million or $0.35 per share, a $12 million or $0.05 per share improvement from the prior year loss. Revenues in our Tax Services segment increased $3 million to $133 million, mainly due to higher Peace of Mind revenues, which are recognized on a deferred basis. This increase was partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency rates. Operating expenses in our Tax Services segment increased $18 million to $297 million due to occupancy costs and depreciation and amortization expense related to the franchise acquisitions in the prior year. In our Corporate segment, pretax loss improved $8 million to $18 million mainly due to lower interest expense and as a result of repaying the $400 million note in October of 2014. We also had favorability in taxes compared to the prior year quarter due to discrete items.\r\nTurning to discontinued operations. The net loss of $3 million was an improvement of $4 million, primarily driven by a provision for potential losses related to Sand Canyon's representation of warranty obligations in the prior year quarter compared with no such provision reported in the current quarter. At July 31, Sand Canyon's representation of warranty accrual was consistent with the prior quarter at $150 million. As a reminder, Sand Canyon is and always has been operated as a separate legal entity from H&R Block. We continue to believe our legal position is strong and ante any potential corporate veil-piercing arguments.\r\nWith the quarterly results behind us, I'd now like to turn to our announcement regarding the closing of the bank transaction and our capital structure plans.\r\nFirst, let me provide some details regarding the impact of our bank transaction. From a financial perspective, we continue to expect the impact of the program management agreement to be dilutive by approximately $0.08 to $0.10 per share annually based on current fully diluted shares outstanding. Of the $0.08 to $0.10 per share, approximately 60% will be reflected as a reduction of revenue with the remainder reflected as an increase in expenses.\r\nThe reduction in revenue includes $0.02 per share of lost interest income resulting from the sale of our available-for-sale securities, which I will talk about later. We will incur onetime charges related to this transaction of approximately $0.02 to $0.03 per share -- again, to be clear, based on current fully diluted shares outstanding. These charges will be recorded in our second fiscal quarter of this year. Additionally, interest income from our mortgage portfolio and available-for-sale securities will be reported as other income rather than revenue. This revenue change will only impact future results and will not be applied retroactively. For a more detailed explanation of the impact of these changes, we have elected to provide the pro forma impact of the EPS dilution and reported changes as part of our related 8-K filing.\r\nFrom a balance sheet perspective, we transferred all of our customer banking deposits to BofI and made a onetime cash payment of approximately $419 million at the time of close. The bank assets also included available-for-sale securities and mortgage loans held for investment. As part of the funding of this transaction, we sold $220 million of the bank's available-for-sale securities and intend to liquidate the remainder of this investment for approximately $170 million by the end of the fiscal quarter.\r\nWe currently plan to retain the mortgage loan portfolio, which totaled $230 million at July 31 and consists of mature performing loans. While for many reasons we prefer not to own a mortgage portfolio, it currently does not make economic sense to sell it. Instead for now, we plan to allow it to wind down naturally, although we will continue to regularly evaluate options for this portfolio in the future.\r\nI'd now like to spend a few minutes talking about our capital structure. I'm excited about the significant changes we are making. We are now able to put our regulatory limitations behind us and move forward with a financial structure that appropriately reflects our capital-light business model. The foundation of this new structure is the 4-year $3.5 billion share repurchase program, which represents the continuation of our strong history of and commitment to returning capital to shareholders. In the past, we have been disciplined buyers of our shares, and we intend to continue this practice going forward. Also included in the plan is incremental debt and a new committed line of credit. We believe that this is a balanced and appropriate capital structure for H&R Block that is in the best interest of you, our shareholders. \r\nNow I'd like to take you through each of the elements of this planned capital structure to provide more context around our decision and clarity around what this means for our company and for our shareholders. First, the Board of Directors approved a new $3.5 billion share repurchase program effective immediately through June 2019. Under the new program, we plan to commence a modified Dutch auction tender offer tomorrow to purchase up to $1.5 billion of our common stock, subject to certain terms and conditions, at a price per share not less than $32.25 and not greater than $37. The upper end of this price range represents a 12% premium to the company's closing price today. To ensure we have the appropriate level of liquidity over the next several years, the tender offer will be contingent upon, among other customary items, the successful replacement of our line of credit, which I'll discuss momentarily. Additional details regarding the pricing and other terms will be provided upon formal commencement of the tender offer, which we expect to happen tomorrow.\r\nAfter the completion of the offer, we intend to repurchase shares over time in an opportunistic manner through open market purchases and may also repurchase shares through private transactions, exchange offers, additional tender offers or other means. The amount and timing of such repurchases will be dependent on market conditions and other factors. The funding for share repurchases under the overall program and the tender offer will come from available cash, borrowings and incremental debt and funds from ongoing business operations. \r\nMoving to leverage. As we have stated in the past, we believe we have capacity to increase our leverage while maintaining investment-grade ratings metrics. We currently believe that a ratio of adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA of approximately 2.5x to 3x would be consistent with our previously-stated intention to maintain investment-grade ratings metrics. We calculate adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA using a fiscal 4-quarter rolling average of total outstanding gross debt, including both short term and long term, and include adjustments for items such as operating leases which are not capitalized in the company's balance sheet. We estimate that the adjustment for our operating leases equates to approximately a half turn of adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA. Based on this analysis, we intend to take on borrowings and incremental debt but have not yet determined the amount, timing and composition of such debt.\r\nFinally, we are working to replace our current $1.5 billion line of credit. We hope to accomplish a few things with this new facility. First, this will lock in our off-season liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. Second, we will amend certain covenants, which will be more in line with our expected future capital structure. Third, depending on market conditions, we intend to upsize the facility. Finally, we will structure the facility such that we draw on a line of credit rather than use commercial paper to fund our off-season needs.\r\nAnd one last note. Given the breadth of this announcement regarding our capital structure, we felt it best to preannounce our plans regarding future leverage actions. Going forward, however, we expect to return to our historical practice and do not intend to preannounce most capital transactions.\r\nTo conclude, we've been thoughtful and thorough in our approach to our capital structure, and we believe that this new structure appropriately recognizes our business needs and is consistent with the company's long history of returning capital to shareholders. We are committed to driving medium and long-term value for our shareholders. We've been doing just that through our operational performance of the past few years, and now, we're excited to be supplementing that performance with the right approach to our capital structure.\r\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call back to Bill.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Greg. Again, we are very pleased that we have completed the divestiture of our bank and are no longer regulated as a savings and loan holding company. We are now able to operate the business with a capital structure that makes sense for our operating model and is in the best interest of our shareholders. We are focused on delivering positive results through both capital return and the successful operation of our core business.\r\nWith that, I'll now open it up for your questions. Operator?",

To ensure we have the appropriate level of liquidity over the next several years, the tender offer will be contingent upon, among other customary items, the successful replacement of our line of credit, which I'll discuss momentarily. Additional details regarding the pricing and other terms will be provided upon formal commencement of the tender offer, which we expect to happen tomorrow.\r\nAfter the completion of the offer, we intend to repurchase shares over time in an opportunistic manner through open market purchases and may also repurchase shares through private transactions, exchange offers, additional tender offers or other means. The amount and timing of such repurchases will be dependent on market conditions and other factors. The funding for share repurchases under the overall program and the tender offer will come from available cash, borrowings and incremental debt and funds from ongoing business operations. \r\nMoving to leverage. As we have stated in the past, we believe we have capacity to increase our leverage while maintaining investment-grade ratings metrics. We currently believe that a ratio of adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA of approximately 2.5x to 3x would be consistent with our previously-stated intention to maintain investment-grade ratings metrics. We calculate adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA using a fiscal 4-quarter rolling average of total outstanding gross debt, including both short term and long term, and include adjustments for items such as operating leases which are not capitalized in the company's balance sheet. We estimate that the adjustment for our operating leases equates to approximately a half turn of adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA. Based on this analysis, we intend to take on borrowings and incremental debt but have not yet determined the amount, timing and composition of such debt.\r\nFinally, we are working to replace our current $1.5 billion line of credit. We hope to accomplish a few things with this new facility. First, this will lock in our off-season liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. Second, we will amend certain covenants, which will be more in line with our expected future capital structure. Third, depending on market conditions, we intend to upsize the facility. Finally, we will structure the facility such that we draw on a line of credit rather than use commercial paper to fund our off-season needs.\r\nAnd one last note. Given the breadth of this announcement regarding our capital structure, we felt it best to preannounce our plans regarding future leverage actions. Going forward, however, we expect to return to our historical practice and do not intend to preannounce most capital transactions.\r\nTo conclude, we've been thoughtful and thorough in our approach to our capital structure, and we believe that this new structure appropriately recognizes our business needs and is consistent with the company's long history of returning capital to shareholders. We are committed to driving medium and long-term value for our shareholders. We've been doing just that through our operational performance of the past few years, and now, we're excited to be supplementing that performance with the right approach to our capital structure.\r\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call back to Bill.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: William Cobb (Executives)】\nThank you, Greg. Again, we are very pleased that we have completed the divestiture of our bank and are no longer regulated as a savings and loan holding company. We are now able to operate the business with a capital structure that makes sense for our operating model and is in the best interest of our shareholders. We are focused on delivering positive results through both capital return and the successful operation of our core business.\r\nWith that, I'll now open it up for your questions. Operator?",
      "transcript_text3": "So first question, any updated plans for the dividend?\n\n---\n\nGo ahead, Greg.\n\n---\n\nYes, there's no -- we have no comment on our dividend at this point in time, Thomas.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then around your leverage ratios, can you help us think about -- can you give us what your current adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA is so we can think about it going forward?\n\n---\n\nYes. I'm going to answer maybe a little bit differently, if that's okay. But as we've outlined in the prepared remarks, effectively we're talking about is adjusted gross debt divided by adjusted EBITDA. And the adjustment, of course, in our view is really the operating leases, which is the convention that both Standard & Poor's and Moody's follows. Given the nature of Block's business, we have a large number of operating leases. We quantify that roughly about $450 million, just for the record. The gross debt is really a reflection of both short term and long term, so that's seasonal funding as well as long-term/medium-term funding. And you should calculate it on a 4-quarter outstanding sort of gross basis, so adding up those things over 4 quarters. So that's kind of how I'd answer the question.\n\n---\n\nOkay. A couple more questions on the capital structure. Are you going to be willing to buy back stock during the tax season going forward?\n\n---\n\nSo for now, the $1.5 billion tender offer is what we've outlined and as we said in the prepared remarks, we're really just talking about being opportunistic past then and -- but the focus for now remains the tender offer.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And -- okay, maybe I'll ask one question about -- not about the bank and about the capital structure and then I'll be done. Promise. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed changing the Earned Income Tax Credit forms. I think you guys have been -- you've been advocating that. What do you think the chances are that the full Congress changes the forms ahead of next tax season?\n\n---\n\nSo we're obviously working closely with the Treasury on that. I think we're getting close to a decision. We're very hopeful that there will be progress in this tax season, but I don't have anything to update you on at this point.\n\n---\n\nI guess, Bill, let's start out the -- or Greg, the time line for how the tender, the shares will open -- will work. I understand that opens tomorrow. You'll complete the new CLOC prior to the completion of the tender. What's the time line? How will this work, to the extent you can help us think about that?\n\n---\n\nYes. And just to be clear for everybody, when you announce a tender like we are today, there are very strict rules on what we can say and can't say, so I'm going to have to be very factual here, if that's okay. And for future questions, please keep that in mind. We are intending to open it up tomorrow, September 2. As we outlined in the presentation, it is contingent upon successfully closing the CLOC and other customary conditions. And we'd certainly point you to the document, which will be available, really, starting tomorrow morning would be our estimate, and then the plan is to have it close on October 2 -- the tender, in this case -- contingent upon both the CLOC and these other requirements.\n\n---\n\nOkay. The new CLOC, I guess you said in the press release market conditions will dictate, I suppose, the size. How will it change? You made mention -- no more commercial paper. I'm curious about that decision and what shape or form this new CLOC will take? And what type of covenants will it have? Will it require that you pay all borrowings off by April 30 every year? And anything else, Greg, that you would throw in that may be interesting about it.\n\n---\n\nYes. I mean, commercial paper has always been kind of more of a luxury from our perspective. It's really more of a cost savings. I think in the last few years, with the regulatory changes and the way that banks look at the economics of CLOCs that, that sort of arbitrage as it were is changed a little bit. We felt it very appropriate given these broader announcements that our capital structure to use this as an opportunity to relook at the CLOC. We have a great facility right now. We've got great banks that are part of that. We're going to relook at that, and we've talked about the 3 major benefits in the prepared remarks. I can't comment on what may come out of that because obviously it's not finalized at this point in time. Of course, when it is finalized, we'll provide more details as appropriate.\n\n---\n\nJust one more for me, actually going off that topic. Was curious about the discrete tax items in the quarter and just thinking about going forward, could you give us a little more color on what that was and maybe some ideas to keep in our head as we model for the remainder of the year.\n\n---\n\nYes, we -- as many of you know, we've got a tax rate that is naturally at the high-end of the range for corporations in the United States, in the high 30% range. We've been actively looking at a number of strategies, and we've been successfully able to execute them pretty consistently over the last couple of tax seasons and it also continues through this current quarter. Those are discrete in nature, and what I mean by that is they are onetime; all really good, there's real benefits to the company. We have not yet communicated what we think the more permanent or long-term view is we think the effective tax rate is, but we plan to do so at some point in the future.\n\n---\n\nGreg, are you able to talk at all about what type of rate you anticipate on this new CLOC? Will it be similar to what you have? Or is there an opportunity to lower that?\n\n---\n\nYes, I can't really give you a forecast at this point in time. It's going to be subject to market conditions, timing. We're going to look at 10-year structures. Our view is it'll be consistent with other market transactions similar to this, but I can't give you more guidance than that.\n\n---\n\nWhat about -- I know you're going to use the CLOC obviously to buy back shares and do some off-season funding. But is there thoughts that after you do this initially, you'll term out some of that debt? Or we use the CLOC and then the cash you get in as the season ends to kind of manage the CLOC?\n\n---\n\nYes, I mean, we provided through the press release and today's comments and guidance on how we think that we have additional incremental debt capacity on the balance sheet. We're not at a point we're going to get more specific than that. I don't think sort of buying back shares with sort of daily overnight money is the right sort of term structure to go with. But we feel very comfortable with the tender that we've announced, with the contingency around the CLOC as well as other customary conditions, that we'll be able to fulfill the $1.5 billion tender offer.\n\n---\n\nAnd again, Kartik, I would caution everyone, what we're doing here and there's -- and I'll leave it to Greg to talk about the sources and uses. What we're trying to do here is not position this as incremental debt to do this or that. We're trying to reset the capital structure here. We're no longer a savings or loan holding company. This gives us an ability to set up our capital structure in line with our true business model going forward. And then from that, we will then make decisions within the framework of what we talked about today from a capital structure perspective.\n\n---\n\nAnd then maybe just one last question. Greg, in the past you've talked about kind of the cash that's on the balance sheet and maybe some of the cash that might not be available, whether it's offshore or the available-for-sale securities. Can you kind of walk through that just to give an idea what's on the balance sheet and how the CLOC plays into that?\n\n---\n\nYes. We've been pretty consistent in communicating with you, especially last quarter, so that when we expected the time the bank transaction to close, which is, of course, now closed, that we'd have about $1 billion of extra capital available. And I'm confirming that again today with you. That's one of the primary sources, of course, for what we're planning to do here and announced. In terms of mind assent [ph], this structure outside of the country and/or restricted, that's not really -- in our minds as part of the permanent capital structure. We have done a good job in the last couple of years bringing some of that back from Canada, Australia, and that's part of what the $1 billion represents.\n\n---\n\nAnd Bill, you talked about this being a milestone. After a few years, you finally have the company you wanted it to be. And so going forward, for you, what -- could you remind us of the strategic focus now that you have your Tax Plus business without the distraction? And same question to you, Greg, you worked very hard changing the cost structure of the company and then now you've set up the changes to the capital structure. And I'm sure you still have a lot of work, obviously, to execute on this transition, on this reset. But once you've done that, what's the next big task in transformation that you'd like to take on?\n\n---\n\nAnd yes, it does -- it has been a bit of a long journey here. And again, you said it well and you and I have talked about this, we now, if you will, have the company that we wanted. The core of our strategy is what we call Tax Plus. We're going to center the company on the tax preparation event, and that is consistent whether we're talking about international or here in the U.S. Our principle is to serve clients the way that they want to be served, whether that be through digital efforts or in -- with assistance. And we will continue to operate with that's consistent with our brand and determine -- and I think what we did last year with Tax Identity Shield is an example, where can we add value to our clients' lives? If we're able to monetize that, but ultimately, we want to be the place where we do the best job on taxes, the most accurate job where we get the maximum refund for our clients and do it in a way that protects their security. And that will continue to be -- it's somewhat of a simple notion, but I think in -- a lot of times in business and when I first started with this company, a lot of investors said to me, can you -- your story is too complicated, your story is too complicated. Well, I think we've got a nice simple story right now that I'm really proud of, and I think we can continue to drive a lot of value. Do you want to take the second part, Greg?\n\n---\n\nYes. I mean, to keep it simple, I think you did a sort of very nice high-level summary there, Gil. But cost, capital, I mean, what's next? I mean, it's not next, we've been working on it already, but it helps us to continue to focus on even more is really with the revenue side of the business model. As you know and many people on the phone know, we really want to get to a point where we're sustainably growing 4-plus percent, and to borrow a quote from my good friend, Jason Houseworth, who runs our digital business in our product side, \"form an IP focused on that.\" And we, at that point, will be able to spend much more time talking about the early season challenges that we've had the last few seasons, continue talking about the value proposition, continuing to talk about all the things we can do to execute, to be more relevant for our clients and frankly, to win more clients from some of our competitors.\n\n---\n\nI will also add my congratulations on the bank divestiture closing. Could you provide some thoughts around just your general philosophy around how you'd like to stage your buyback program through 2019?\n\n---\n\nWell, we're -- the opening number, we're kind of coming out with a big production, if you will. But again, I would go back to the facts here. The board has authorized a $3.5 billion authorization through June of 2019. That's essentially 4 tax seasons. We will have a tender offer we will launch tomorrow, which we think is a great way to take immediate action. And then from there, we're not going to be -- we have options in front of us, but I think what I would focus on is that we're looking at this over that 4-year time frame. I don't know, Greg, if you have anything you want to add.\n\n---\n\nGreat. That's helpful. And around your ongoing dividend policy, could you share your thoughts around -- just in general, your dividend policy and any room for potential dividend step-ups down the line?\n\n---\n\nYes. I mean, our focus right now is what we've announced today and we don't really have much comments on our dividend policy. I mean, obviously, everyone knows we pay a dividend and the yield, depending where the stock price is at, is in the mid-2% range. And we've been in that range now for a couple of years so, but we have no --\n\n---\n\nWe did raise the dividend 33% a few years ago, but we don't have any comment beyond what we stated today.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And then last question around the fundamentals. You've indicated you're targeting 4% top line growth. Can you -- now that the bank divestiture is behind us, you can focus on your Tax Plus strategy. Can you give maybe 2 or 3 initiatives that you think will help bridge growth today to that target 4% growth?\n\n---\n\nYes, a very fair question and consistent with the way we've handled this, I think, in the past. I'm not going to get into that, certainly on September 1. As we get closer to Investor Day and the actual tax season, we'll share more of those plans then.\n\n---\n\nTwo quick ones for you. One on the capital structure first. Could you give us a sense of what the ratings agency discussions have fared like on the capital structure? I'm just trying to get a sense of whether your leverage levels under this investment-grade rating has a likelihood of being extended as you go forward.\n\n---\n\nYes. So we have regular conversations with Standard & Poor's and Moody's. We have good relationships. We have a lot of respect for the team at both firms. We would, in the normal course, talk about our business performance. What we said today is we believe that with this plan, that will maintain investment-grade metrics but ultimately, that's the decision that the ratings agencies are going to make and that's really their call, not ours.\n\n---\n\nUnderstood. And then one on the business at hand. One of your competitors has talked about their expectations of about 2% growth for the industry and over 2% growth in the assisted channel. I'm wondering if you can discuss some of the moving pieces as to why your expectations are slightly more muted there.\n\n---\n\nYes, I don't know that we've commented on certainly the upcoming tax season. Extensions are still out there, we're still doing tax returns for tax season '15, so we haven't come out with a position on growth going forward. Again, as we get closer to the tax season and/or at Investor Day, we'll have an indication on that. We'll study -- the tax season will have fully closed and then we'll give you what our belief is as a best estimate.\n\n---\n\nJust wanted to go back to the dividend questioning. I know you have no comment specifically, but is there anything precluding you right now that the divestiture of the bank is done from changing the amount of your dividend?\n\n---\n\nNo. Sorry, no, just to be clear.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then again, sorry to ask this one, but the size of the share repurchase I think is much larger than most people had expected. I'm just curious why $3.5 billion? Why not $2.5 billion or $4.5 billion? Why that amount?\n\n---\n\nYes. So this is one of those awkward questions because of the tender situation I'm not able to get into it in much detail. All I can tell you is that it was well considered and discussed with the board and management and outside advisers and we felt it was the appropriate number.\n\n---\n\nYes, I was going to say the same thing, is, I mean, there was great deliberation given to this. Obviously, during the time when the -- we're in the regulatory approval process, we couldn't talk too much about it, but obviously, we spent a lot of time on that. And we had said consistently that upon closing of the transaction and us being deregistered, we would come out with our plan shortly thereafter, and hopefully, we hit that marker.\n\n---\n\nConsidering the stability of the tax business, what's the financial benefit of being investment grade?\n\n---\n\nYou want to go, Greg?\n\n---\n\nYes, I mean, we've been -- thanks for the question, Mike. So we've been very consistent in our perspective on this, but it's been a well-considered topic of discussion with the board and management. We talked to a lot of external people over the last couple of years, and we've gone public and said we believe there's value in maintaining investment-grade metrics for H&R Block. We've not been specific as to why. There are a number of considerations that are unique to Block, but there are some general things as well. We just don't think it's very valuable at this point to get into specific articulation of that.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Is talking about the financial -- the difference in cost, well, under the non-discussable items?\n\n---\n\nSir, can you repeat the question, Mike?\n\n---\n\nI'm not sure I understood that question there, Mike. Can you...\n\n---\n\nSo I was kind of curious in talking -- in saying that you don't want to get into some aspects of it. I was just wondering to what extent that -- why is that the case?\n\n---\n\nYes, I mean, as we said and say again, we're not going to get into the specific articulation of the pros and cons. We've been consistent, we think there's value in it, and we're not going to share more than that.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Could you talk a little about Sand Canyon? How much equity is left in the business -- that you have in the business? If you indeed finish the constructive discussions, would that free up some additional actual cash?\n\n---\n\nSo, thank you for that question. It wouldn't be a call, if we didn't have a Sand Canyon one. So thanks,\r\nMike, for bringing that here at the end of this. So I mean, as I said in the script, there is no real major change this quarter in Sand Canyon's perspective on things. The representation of warranty reserve continues to be at $150 million. And there are several counterparties that are in tolling arrangements that are moving along with Sand Canyon. In addition to that $150 million is a couple of hundred, $200 million plus of equity. And if you sort of reverse tax effect that, that sort of means there's net assets as it were of $450-odd million in total. The view that H&R Block has and I think that Sand Canyon would have is, this is a time-bound issue, it will take multiple years to resolve. My personal view, again, sort of a situation where there is no exposure to Block is really kind of the expected outcome at this point in time. I don't think we would be in a position where we'll be able to forecast down the road anything more in terms of positive cash back to the company. And as always, we point you to the quarterly disclosures and the annual disclosures for a lot more detail on this.\n\n---\n\nAnd a tax question. For the EITC, what do you expect -- or do you expect that to make a percentage of that online going back to assisted and to what extent do you -- how much do you think that's going to be?\n\n---\n\nWith regard to making the documentation requirements consistent, we are certainly in active discussion as part of an overall software working development group with the IRS and with Treasury. And I think that there has been a lot of discussion. It's a policy question, but I think we are -- the ball is being advanced. I just don't know how that far for this tax season, but we certainly believe that it's the right principle, that no matter what your method of filing, that it be consistent in terms of what you need to document. And I'm hopeful that, that will happen for the -- certainly for this tax season.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Thank you, everyone, for joining us on today's call. We'll look forward to talking to you down the road.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Thomas Allen (Analysts)】\nSo first question, any updated plans for the dividend?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nGo ahead, Greg.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nYes, there's no -- we have no comment on our dividend at this point in time, Thomas.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thomas Allen (Analysts)】\nOkay.

And then from that, we will then make decisions within the framework of what we talked about today from a capital structure perspective.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kartik Mehta (Analysts)】\nAnd then maybe just one last question. Greg, in the past you've talked about kind of the cash that's on the balance sheet and maybe some of the cash that might not be available, whether it's offshore or the available-for-sale securities. Can you kind of walk through that just to give an idea what's on the balance sheet and how the CLOC plays into that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nYes. We've been pretty consistent in communicating with you, especially last quarter, so that when we expected the time the bank transaction to close, which is, of course, now closed, that we'd have about $1 billion of extra capital available. And I'm confirming that again today with you. That's one of the primary sources, of course, for what we're planning to do here and announced. In terms of mind assent [ph], this structure outside of the country and/or restricted, that's not really -- in our minds as part of the permanent capital structure. We have done a good job in the last couple of years bringing some of that back from Canada, Australia, and that's part of what the $1 billion represents.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gil Luria (Analysts)】\nAnd Bill, you talked about this being a milestone. After a few years, you finally have the company you wanted it to be. And so going forward, for you, what -- could you remind us of the strategic focus now that you have your Tax Plus business without the distraction? And same question to you, Greg, you worked very hard changing the cost structure of the company and then now you've set up the changes to the capital structure. And I'm sure you still have a lot of work, obviously, to execute on this transition, on this reset. But once you've done that, what's the next big task in transformation that you'd like to take on?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nAnd yes, it does -- it has been a bit of a long journey here. And again, you said it well and you and I have talked about this, we now, if you will, have the company that we wanted. The core of our strategy is what we call Tax Plus. We're going to center the company on the tax preparation event, and that is consistent whether we're talking about international or here in the U.S. Our principle is to serve clients the way that they want to be served, whether that be through digital efforts or in -- with assistance. And we will continue to operate with that's consistent with our brand and determine -- and I think what we did last year with Tax Identity Shield is an example, where can we add value to our clients' lives? If we're able to monetize that, but ultimately, we want to be the place where we do the best job on taxes, the most accurate job where we get the maximum refund for our clients and do it in a way that protects their security. And that will continue to be -- it's somewhat of a simple notion, but I think in -- a lot of times in business and when I first started with this company, a lot of investors said to me, can you -- your story is too complicated, your story is too complicated. Well, I think we've got a nice simple story right now that I'm really proud of, and I think we can continue to drive a lot of value. Do you want to take the second part, Greg?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nYes. I mean, to keep it simple, I think you did a sort of very nice high-level summary there, Gil. But cost, capital, I mean, what's next? I mean, it's not next, we've been working on it already, but it helps us to continue to focus on even more is really with the revenue side of the business model. As you know and many people on the phone know, we really want to get to a point where we're sustainably growing 4-plus percent, and to borrow a quote from my good friend, Jason Houseworth, who runs our digital business in our product side, \"form an IP focused on that.\" And we, at that point, will be able to spend much more time talking about the early season challenges that we've had the last few seasons, continue talking about the value proposition, continuing to talk about all the things we can do to execute, to be more relevant for our clients and frankly, to win more clients from some of our competitors.\n\n---\n\n【質問: George Tong (Analysts)】\nI will also add my congratulations on the bank divestiture closing. Could you provide some thoughts around just your general philosophy around how you'd like to stage your buyback program through 2019?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nWell, we're -- the opening number, we're kind of coming out with a big production, if you will. But again, I would go back to the facts here. The board has authorized a $3.5 billion authorization through June of 2019. That's essentially 4 tax seasons. We will have a tender offer we will launch tomorrow, which we think is a great way to take immediate action. And then from there, we're not going to be -- we have options in front of us, but I think what I would focus on is that we're looking at this over that 4-year time frame. I don't know, Greg, if you have anything you want to add.\n\n---\n\n【質問: George Tong (Analysts)】\nGreat. That's helpful. And around your ongoing dividend policy, could you share your thoughts around -- just in general, your dividend policy and any room for potential dividend step-ups down the line?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nYes. I mean, our focus right now is what we've announced today and we don't really have much comments on our dividend policy. I mean, obviously, everyone knows we pay a dividend and the yield, depending where the stock price is at, is in the mid-2% range. And we've been in that range now for a couple of years so, but we have no --\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nWe did raise the dividend 33% a few years ago, but we don't have any comment beyond what we stated today.\n\n---\n\n【質問: George Tong (Analysts)】\nGreat. And then last question around the fundamentals. You've indicated you're targeting 4% top line growth. Can you -- now that the bank divestiture is behind us, you can focus on your Tax Plus strategy. Can you give maybe 2 or 3 initiatives that you think will help bridge growth today to that target 4% growth?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nYes, a very fair question and consistent with the way we've handled this, I think, in the past. I'm not going to get into that, certainly on September 1. As we get closer to Investor Day and the actual tax season, we'll share more of those plans then.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Anjaneya Singh (Analysts)】\nTwo quick ones for you. One on the capital structure first. Could you give us a sense of what the ratings agency discussions have fared like on the capital structure? I'm just trying to get a sense of whether your leverage levels under this investment-grade rating has a likelihood of being extended as you go forward.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nYes. So we have regular conversations with Standard & Poor's and Moody's. We have good relationships. We have a lot of respect for the team at both firms. We would, in the normal course, talk about our business performance. What we said today is we believe that with this plan, that will maintain investment-grade metrics but ultimately, that's the decision that the ratings agencies are going to make and that's really their call, not ours.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Anjaneya Singh (Analysts)】\nUnderstood. And then one on the business at hand. One of your competitors has talked about their expectations of about 2% growth for the industry and over 2% growth in the assisted channel. I'm wondering if you can discuss some of the moving pieces as to why your expectations are slightly more muted there.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nYes, I don't know that we've commented on certainly the upcoming tax season. Extensions are still out there, we're still doing tax returns for tax season '15, so we haven't come out with a position on growth going forward. Again, as we get closer to the tax season and/or at Investor Day, we'll have an indication on that. We'll study -- the tax season will have fully closed and then we'll give you what our belief is as a best estimate.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jeffrey Silber (Analysts)】\nJust wanted to go back to the dividend questioning. I know you have no comment specifically, but is there anything precluding you right now that the divestiture of the bank is done from changing the amount of your dividend?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nNo. Sorry, no, just to be clear.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jeffrey Silber (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then again, sorry to ask this one, but the size of the share repurchase I think is much larger than most people had expected. I'm just curious why $3.5 billion? Why not $2.5 billion or $4.5 billion? Why that amount?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nYes. So this is one of those awkward questions because of the tender situation I'm not able to get into it in much detail. All I can tell you is that it was well considered and discussed with the board and management and outside advisers and we felt it was the appropriate number.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nYes, I was going to say the same thing, is, I mean, there was great deliberation given to this. Obviously, during the time when the -- we're in the regulatory approval process, we couldn't talk too much about it, but obviously, we spent a lot of time on that. And we had said consistently that upon closing of the transaction and us being deregistered, we would come out with our plan shortly thereafter, and hopefully, we hit that marker.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Millman (Analysts)】\nConsidering the stability of the tax business, what's the financial benefit of being investment grade?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nYou want to go, Greg?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nYes, I mean, we've been -- thanks for the question, Mike. So we've been very consistent in our perspective on this, but it's been a well-considered topic of discussion with the board and management. We talked to a lot of external people over the last couple of years, and we've gone public and said we believe there's value in maintaining investment-grade metrics for H&R Block. We've not been specific as to why. There are a number of considerations that are unique to Block, but there are some general things as well. We just don't think it's very valuable at this point to get into specific articulation of that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Millman (Analysts)】\nOkay. Is talking about the financial -- the difference in cost, well, under the non-discussable items?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nSir, can you repeat the question, Mike?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nI'm not sure I understood that question there, Mike. Can you...\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Millman (Analysts)】\nSo I was kind of curious in talking -- in saying that you don't want to get into some aspects of it. I was just wondering to what extent that -- why is that the case?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nYes, I mean, as we said and say again, we're not going to get into the specific articulation of the pros and cons. We've been consistent, we think there's value in it, and we're not going to share more than that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Millman (Analysts)】\nOkay. Could you talk a little about Sand Canyon? How much equity is left in the business -- that you have in the business? If you indeed finish the constructive discussions, would that free up some additional actual cash?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nSo, thank you for that question. It wouldn't be a call, if we didn't have a Sand Canyon one. So thanks,\r\nMike, for bringing that here at the end of this. So I mean, as I said in the script, there is no real major change this quarter in Sand Canyon's perspective on things. The representation of warranty reserve continues to be at $150 million. And there are several counterparties that are in tolling arrangements that are moving along with Sand Canyon. In addition to that $150 million is a couple of hundred, $200 million plus of equity. And if you sort of reverse tax effect that, that sort of means there's net assets as it were of $450-odd million in total. The view that H&R Block has and I think that Sand Canyon would have is, this is a time-bound issue, it will take multiple years to resolve. My personal view, again, sort of a situation where there is no exposure to Block is really kind of the expected outcome at this point in time. I don't think we would be in a position where we'll be able to forecast down the road anything more in terms of positive cash back to the company. And as always, we point you to the quarterly disclosures and the annual disclosures for a lot more detail on this.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Millman (Analysts)】\nAnd a tax question. For the EITC, what do you expect -- or do you expect that to make a percentage of that online going back to assisted and to what extent do you -- how much do you think that's going to be?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nWith regard to making the documentation requirements consistent, we are certainly in active discussion as part of an overall software working development group with the IRS and with Treasury. And I think that there has been a lot of discussion. It's a policy question, but I think we are -- the ball is being advanced. I just don't know how that far for this tax season, but we certainly believe that it's the right principle, that no matter what your method of filing, that it be consistent in terms of what you need to document. And I'm hopeful that, that will happen for the -- certainly for this tax season.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Colby Brown (Executives)】\nOkay. Thank you, everyone, for joining us on today's call. We'll look forward to talking to you down the road.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you, Stephanie. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the fourth quarter earnings call for Campbell Soup's fiscal 2015. With me here in New Jersey are Denise Morrison, President and CEO; Anthony DiSilvestro, CFO; and Blake MacMinn, Senior Manager, Investor Relations. \r\nAs usual, we have created slides to accompany our earnings presentation. You will find the slides posted on our website this morning at investor.campbellsoupcompany.com. \r\nThis call is open to the media, who participate in a listen-only mode. \r\nToday, we will make forward-looking statements, which reflect our current expectations. These statements rely on assumptions and estimates, which could be inaccurate and are subject to risk. Please refer to our Slide 2 or our SEC filings for a list of factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements. \r\nNow I'd like to remind you about items impacting comparability. As we said in this morning's news release, in the fourth quarter, the company incurred charges associated with its initiatives to implement a new enterprise design that better aligns with our strategies, to reduce costs and to streamline organizational structure. \r\nThe company recorded pretax restructuring charges of $93 million related to the program and pretax charges of $13 million in administrative expenses related to the implementation of these initiatives. \r\nThe aggregate after-tax impact of the restructuring charges and implementation cost was $0.21 per share. \r\nLast year, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we recorded $21 million of pretax restructuring charges and restructuring-related costs. We also recorded an additional $4 million of pretax settlement charges associated with a U.S. pension plan. The aggregate after-tax impact of these items was $0.06 per share. \r\nAlso as a reminder, fiscal 2014 included 53 weeks with the extra week falling in the fourth quarter. The extra week was worth an estimated $129 million in net sales, $37 million in EBIT and $0.08 in EPS. The adjusted results exclude the impact of the additional week in the prior year. Our comparisons of the full year 2015 with 2014 will exclude previously announced items. \r\nBecause we use non-GAAP measures, we have provided a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is included in our appendix. \r\nLastly, please mark your calendars for our planned fiscal 2016 earnings dates. We plan to release first quarter earnings on November 24, which will include the new segments and pension and postretirement benefit accounting changes with the recasted prior year Q1 data. Shortly after we release our 10-Q, we will release the remaining recasted financials. The next 3 earnings dates are February 25, May 20 and September 1, 2016. \r\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Denise.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Ken, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. This morning, I will offer my perspective on our performance, provide a progress report on several major strategic actions we initiated in 2015, including our redesigned enterprise structure and cost savings effort, and share my outlook and areas of focus for fiscal 2016. \r\nAt our Investor Day in July, I described how the food industry is in a period of revolutionary change, which presents both challenges and opportunities for Campbell. The changes in the industry are being driven by several seismic shifts: new global economic realities in the U.S. and abroad; major demographic changes and the redefinition of the American family; profound changes in consumer preferences for food with greater focus on health and well-being; and the impact of digital technologies on marketing, shopping and the growing demand for greater transparency about food. \r\nThe convergence and acceleration of these shifts are reshaping the consumer and retailer landscape. Combined with the prevailing industry dynamics of consolidation and cost cutting, these shifts are placing increased pressure on traditional center store categories and mainstream food companies. \r\nWith this as context, I'll focus my remarks this morning on our performance for fiscal 2015, review the important strategic actions we initiated during the year and highlight our key drivers for fiscal 2016. \r\nFirst, I'll briefly comment on our fourth quarter results. I'm pleased that we finished fiscal 2015 in line with our revised expectations. Sales in the fourth quarter reflected the tough consumer operating environment with organic sales increasing 1%. 3 of our 5 segments grew organic sales in the quarter. \r\nMore importantly, we made significant progress in our internal actions to address our supply chain issues related to shipping capacity and customer service. We also made substantial strides to improve our cost structure through our cost savings initiatives and enterprise redesign. \r\nWe reported the largest gross margin improvement in more than 6 years. Adjusted EBIT and earnings per share increased 5% in the fourth quarter. I was particularly pleased with the fourth quarter organic sales and earnings performance in U.S. Simple Meals as well as organic sales growth in Bolthouse and Foodservice. \r\nIn the quarter, we also completed the acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet, a fresh salsa and hummus business that will provide a platform for our further expansion in the deli section. \r\nTurning to our full year results. With a solid finish, we delivered sales, adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS consistent with our most recent guidance. Organic sales increased 1% with growth in 4 of our 5 reporting segments. Adjusted EBIT was down 2% for the year and adjusted gross margin declined 70 basis points for the year, within the range that we had expected. \r\nAs I look at the year, I'm pleased that our management team responded to our first half cost and margin challenges in a difficult operating environment. I am particularly encouraged with the improvement in gross margin we delivered in the back half and the fact that we posted organic sales growth in 4 of our 5 reporting segments. However, we recognize that we have more work to do. \r\nBefore Anthony provides you with a detailed review of our results, I will offer my perspective on several notable items, focusing on the full year. \r\nLooking at the year within U.S. Simple Meals, the performance of our sauce business was a standout, notably Prego and Campbell's Dinner Sauces. \r\nPrego had another strong year behind the success of our white sauces and overall product superiority. Sales of Campbell's Dinner Sauces increased double digits for the year. \r\nOur strategically important Plum business drove double-digit sales growth with new products and continued distribution gains, especially in the grocery channel. \r\nIn U.S. soup, consumer takeaway was relatively stable and we posted positive share performance. \r\nFor the year, our Global Baking and Snacking segment performed well. Organic sales increased 3% and operating earnings were up 5%. I feel particularly good about the improvement in Australian biscuits as the team made significant progress in this important core business. \r\nIn Southeast Asia, our Indonesia business delivered another year of double-digit growth, but sales declined in the fourth quarter as a result of worsening economic conditions in this market, which we expect to persist. \r\nWe had another year of decline in shelf-stable U.S. Beverages. While the category remains challenged, the underlining trends of our business are beginning to show signs of improvement. Consumer takeaway and share increased in the fourth quarter. Modest sales declines in the V8 Red juice were more than offset by the introduction of V8 Veggie Blends. Trial and repeat of Veggie Blends continue to meet expectations and depth of repeat remains strong. We expect our new advertising campaign to drive additional trial. V8 Splash, our powerhouse brand for kids, and V8 + Energy continue to perform well. In our immediate consumption channel, we're beginning to see some momentum. \r\nWe feel good about the overall direction of this business, but we still face challenges, particularly with the continued decline of our V-Fusion franchise. In fiscal 2016, the entire category will remain under significant pressure. While we expect our U.S. beverages businesses to improve, we're not planning on a return to growth. \r\nLet's now turn to the Bolthouse and Foodservice segment. As a reminder, Bolthouse Farms consists of the farms and CPG businesses. Farms include our retail fresh carrots business and our ingredients business, mainly carrot concentrate. CPG consists of our super premium beverages, ultra-premium beverages and refrigerated salad dressings. \r\nWe continue to be enthusiastic about Bolthouse Farms, especially the branded CPG business. \r\nFor the year, CPG sales increased high single digits. Gains were driven by product innovation, increased distribution for beverages and incremental shelf space at existing customers for our salad dressings. The initial rollout of our cold-pressed organic ultra-premium beverage line, 1915 by Bolthouse Farms, is off to a good start. \r\nAfter completing the acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet in June, we have begun integrating the business. Thus far, there have been no surprises, and we're pleased with the retailer response to our long-term plans. \r\nFiscal 2015 was an eventful year, and we took important steps to lay the foundation for the future. We redesigned our enterprise structure and our 3 new divisions are now operating in line with their declared portfolio roles. We established our Integrated Global Services organization and moved elements of finance, procurement, marketing, sales, HR and IT into this shared service group. It's early days, but we're off to a solid start. The focus in fiscal 2016 will be working smarter, creating efficiencies and reducing costs while starting to build new enterprise capabilities within this group. \r\nWe initiated plans for zero-based budgeting process. We're piloting ZBB in 2 cost categories in fiscal 2016 with plans to expand in the future. We believe this discipline will be of great value to Campbell going forward. \r\nWe're off to a very good start to realizing our $250 million cost savings target. We delivered earlier-than-expected savings of approximately $85 million across several categories, including headcount reductions, nonworking marketing, reduced travel expenses and spending on consultants. \r\nWe added another growth engine with the acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet to bolster our Campbell Fresh portfolio and extend our presence in the perimeter beyond produce into the deli section. \r\nWe initiated an important project to increase consumer trust by providing greater access to information about the ingredients we use and how we make our food. This is accelerating meaningful changes to our recipes. For instance, over time, we're planning to eliminate artificial colors and flavors from nearly all of our North American products. \r\nLooking ahead to fiscal 2016, we plan to deliver moderate growth in what we believe will continue to be a consumer environment marked by caution. \r\nAs we outlined at our Investor Day in July, starting in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we'll change our reporting segments, reflecting our 3 new divisions, each with a distinct portfolio role. \r\nIn our Americas Simple Meals and Beverages division, we will focus on driving moderate growth while expanding our margins. We'll deliver this by focusing on fewer bigger initiatives that will attract new consumers while driving additional consumption by our loyal core consumers. \r\nFor example, our Campbell's Fresh-Brewed soups in K-Cups will provide a new, convenient way for consumers to enjoy soup. This represents an incremental eating occasion that taps into the growing frequency of smaller meals and snacks. \r\nAdditionally, we'll take an industry leadership role by increasing our transparency efforts. We'll provide greater access to information about more of our North American products on the whatsinmyfood.com website. We also plan to do improve more of our recipes, consistent with our purpose. \r\nIn Global Biscuits and Snacks, we're focused on expanding in developed and developing markets while improving our margins. \r\nIn the developed markets of the United States and Australia, we're concentrating on restoring improved levels of growth. \r\nIn the U.S., we'll apply a disciplined focus to consumer-driven innovation, increased marketing behind our Goldfish and Milano brands and fuel growth in our fresh bakery portfolio. \r\nIn Australia, we'll continue to improve our core Shapes product and drive Tim Tam's momentum while shifting our marketing mix towards digital. \r\nWe'll also remain focused on faster-growing spaces, building on markets where we have a foothold such as Indonesia and China. We'll monitor and adjust to the economic conditions in both these countries throughout the year. We recognize that there may be short-term economic pressure in these markets. In the long term, we believe that it's essential to become more geographically diverse with a higher percentage of our business in faster-growing developing markets with an expanding middle class. \r\nIn the Campbell Fresh division, we'll make focused investments to accelerate sales growth and expand into new categories. As we outlined at Investor Day, our priorities are: to build on the successful launch of our ultra-premium offering, 1915. The product is in 2,000 stores today, and we expect to expand to 8,000 stores during the first quarter. \r\nWe will continue to accelerate our refrigerated salad dressing business through innovation and increased distribution. \r\nAnd finally, we will integrate the Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition and our existing refrigerated soup business into the Bolthouse Farms fresh platform and significantly expand our market penetration. \r\nWe expect our C-Fresh business to become a full force growth engine for Campbell. \r\nAcross all of our businesses, we'll continue to actively explore external development opportunities that make both strategic and economic sense. We will also remain focused on transforming our cost structure and culture. We're off to a promising start with our cost reduction efforts, but we must remain diligent and continue to create an ownership mindset where employees treat every dollar as if it were their own. \r\nIn closing, I'm cautious but optimistic about fiscal 2016. I believe that the strategic imperatives we're pursuing, purpose and transparency in our core business, digital marketing and e-commerce, health and well-being and expansion in developing markets, coupled with our divisions' clear portfolio roles, position us well for the year ahead. We're very clear eyed about our challenges, particularly driving sustainable sales growth, but we're now better organized and better prepared to meet those challenges head-on. We believe that our strategy to focus on driving growth, aggressively reducing cost and reinvesting a portion of the savings in the areas of our business with the greatest growth potential is the best way to create shareholder value. \r\nI look forward to answering your questions in a few minutes. Now let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Anthony DiSilvestro.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Denise, and good morning. Before reviewing our results and guidance, I wanted to give you my perspective on our performance and future outlook. \r\nWe finished the year with a solid quarter. I'm very pleased with our gross margin performance in the fourth quarter, which improved by 180 basis points, benefiting from our price realization and productivity effort. The improved gross margin and earlier-than-expected cost reductions drove 5% gains in both adjusted EBIT and EPS for the quarter despite a 2-point negative impact from currency translation. We've made very good progress against our 3-year, $250 million cost savings target, delivering about $85 million of savings in fiscal 2015. For the full year, we delivered results within our recent guidance ranges with EPS of $2.46, at the top end of the range. \r\nLooking ahead to 2016, our guidance, when you exclude the impact of currency translation and the Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition, is within our new long-term targets. \r\nNow I'll review our results in more detail. For the fourth quarter, net sales on an as-reported basis declined 9% to $1.7 billion primarily due to the impact of 1 less week and the negative impact of currency translation. Excluding those factors and our recent acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet, organic net sales increased 1% in the quarter as we benefited from higher selling prices. \r\nAdjusted EBIT increased 5% to $234 million driven by a higher gross margin percentage, partly offset by higher incentive compensation expenses and a 2-point negative impact from currency translation. \r\nAdjusted EPS also increased by 5% to $0.43. \r\nFor the full year, reported net sales declined 2% with organic sales gaining 1% led by the strong performance of our Global Baking and Snacking segment. \r\nAdjusted EBIT declined 2% to $1.2 billion, reflecting a lower gross margin percentage, a 2-point negative impact from currency translation and higher incentive compensation expense, partly offset by volume gains and the benefit of our cost savings initiative. The decline in gross margin, down 70 basis points, was driven by higher-than-anticipated cost inflation and the supply chain issues we experienced in the first half, partly offset by productivity and pricing gains.  \r\nEPS of $2.46 was comparable to the prior year. \r\nDecomposing our sales performance for the quarter, as-reported sales declined 9% with organic sales increasing by 1%. Volume and mix subtracted 1 point, which was primarily in our Global Baking and Snacking and U.S. Beverages segments. \r\nHigher selling prices across 4 of our reportable segments added 1 point to sales. Reduced promotional spending contributed 1 point to sales growth, primarily driven by the Global Baking and Snacking segment. Currency translation had an adverse impact of 3 points. Our 2 primary foreign currencies, the Australian dollar and Canadian dollar, both continued to weaken against the U.S. dollar. \r\nOur recent acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet added 1 point to sales, and the impact of 1 less week subtracted 7 points. \r\nOur adjusted gross margin percentage increased by 180 basis points to 36.1%. For the quarter and moderating relative to earlier quarters, inflation increased by approximately 2%. Inflation and other factors had a negative impact on gross margin of 1.1 points.  Mix had a negative impact of 40 basis points. \r\nIn aggregate, our price realization actions have contributed 1.2 points of margin expansion with 40 basis points from reduced promotional spending, principally trade reductions in Pepperidge Farm, and 80 basis points from higher selling prices, primarily on condensed soups, Prego and in Canada. \r\nLastly, we continue to drive meaningful productivity gains in our supply chain, which contributed 210 basis points of margin improvement in the quarter. And overall, our operating efficiencies were above prior year levels. \r\nMarketing and selling expenses declined by 7% in the quarter, reflecting the impact of currency and reductions in selling expense and nonworking marketing, both benefiting from our cost management efforts, partly offset by an increase in advertising and consumer promotion expense. \r\nAdjusted administrative expenses increased 10%, driven by a higher incentive compensation cost compared to the prior year in which the expense was significantly below targeted levels. \r\nFor additional perspective on our performance, this chart breaks it -- down our EPS change between our operating performance and below-the-line items. \r\nAs you can see, adjusted EPS increased $0.02 compared with the prior year, increasing from $0.41 to $0.43 per share. On a currency-neutral basis, growth in adjusted EBIT contributed $0.04 to EPS. Net interest expense declined $3 million, about $0.01 per share, primarily due to the impact of 1 less week. \r\nWith $200 million of share repurchases throughout the year under our strategic share repurchase program, this has reduced our share count and added $0.01 to EPS in the quarter. \r\nGoing the other way, our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 34.8%, up 80 basis points versus the prior year, reflecting a shift in the mix between U.S. and foreign earnings and negatively impacted EPS by $0.01. \r\nCurrency had a $0.01 negative impact on EPS in the quarter, completing the bridge to $0.43. \r\nNow turning to our segment results. In Global Baking and Snacking, our largest sales segment in the quarter, organic sales increased 1% as growth in Pepperidge Farm and Arnott's were partly offset by a decline in Kelsen. Sales gains in Pepperidge Farm were driven by fresh bakery, Goldfish crackers and frozen products, partly offset by a decline in cookies. Organic growth in Arnott’s reflected gains in Australia, partly offset by a decline in Indonesia. \r\nOperating earnings declined 26%, driven by the impact of 1 less week, higher marketing and administrative expenses, principally incentive compensation, currency translation and impairment charges to minor trademarks, partly offset by gross margin expansion. Excluding the impact of 1 less week, currency translation and the impairment charges, operating profit increased in the quarter. \r\nIn U.S. Simple Meals, organic sales increased 4%. While dollar consumption of soup in measured channels increased 1%, movements in retail inventory levels contributed to sales gains in the quarter. \r\nAs you may recall, movements in retail inventory levels had a negative impact on third quarter sales, and we're experiencing the opposite effect in the fourth quarter. We ended the year with retail inventory levels comparable to the prior year. \r\nOrganic sales in other simple meals increased, driven by the continued strong growth of Prego pasta sauce. \r\nSegment sales also benefited from higher selling prices in condensed soups and Prego pasta sauce. \r\nOperating earnings increased 4%, reflecting organic sales growth, productivity improvements and benefits from our cost savings initiatives, partly offset by cost inflation and the impact of 1 less week. \r\nIn the Bolthouse and Foodservice segment, organic sales increased 4% with growth in Bolthouse Farms beverages and salad dressings and North America Foodservice, partly offset by declines in Bolthouse Farms carrots. \r\nOperating earnings fell 3% on higher administrative expenses and the impact of 1 less week. \r\nU.S. beverage organic sales fell 4% primarily due to volume losses in V8 V-Fusion. While consumer takeaway dollar sales in measured channels was positive, sales were negatively impacted by reductions in retail inventory levels and sales declines in the club channel. Operating earnings declined 23% due to the sales decline, including the impact of 1 less week. \r\nInternational Simple Meals and Beverages organic sales declined 5% from weakness in Canada and Australia. Operating earnings declined $10 million or 48% primarily due to volume declines, including the impact of 1 less week, and currency translation. \r\nThis chart shows the as-reported sales performance of U.S. soup unadjusted for the impact of 1 less week, which subtracted 7 points in the quarter and 1 point for the full year. \r\nFor the quarter, U.S. soup sales declined 2% with condensed down 4%, ready-to-serve down 3% and broth up 11%. Excluding the impact of one less week, sales of condensed soups increased with gains in both eating and cooking varieties driven by net price realization. \r\nSales of ready-to-serve soup also increased, excluding the impact of 1 less week, primarily driven by the launches of our fresh-brewed soup for Keurig and our line of organic soups. The double-digit sales gain on Swanson broth was primarily led by aseptic varieties. \r\nFor the fiscal year, as shown towards the bottom of the chart, soup sales declined 3% versus the prior year as a 3% decline in condensed and a 5% decline in ready-to-serve were partly offset by 3% growth in broth. \r\nHere's the U.S. wet soup category performance and our share results as measured by IRI. \r\nFor the 52-week period ending August 2, 2015, the category as a whole declined 0.9%. Our sales in measured channels declined 0.7% with weakness in ready-to-serve soups partly offset by gains in broth. Our share increased 10 basis points in the last 52 weeks and has now been relatively stable for 3 years. \r\nOther branded players in aggregate had a share of 28.1%, declining 30 basis points, while private label with a 12.6% share gained 20 basis points. \r\nWe had strong cash flow performance in fiscal 2015. Cash from operations increased by $283 million to almost $1.2 billion, driven by lower working capital requirements, wrapping the taxes paid in 2014 on the divestiture of the European Simple Meals business and lower pension contributions. \r\nCapital expenditures increased to $380 million as we increased capacities in Goldfish, Bolthouse Farms beverages, broth in North America and biscuits in Indonesia. \r\nWe paid dividends totaling $394 million, reflecting our current quarterly dividend rate of $0.312 per share. \r\nIn aggregate, we repurchased 244 million of shares in fiscal 2015, 200 million of which were under our strategic share repurchase program. The balance of the repurchases were made to offset dilution from equity-based compensation. \r\nNet debt increased by approximately $60 million to $3.8 billion as gains in cash flow were more than offset by the $232 million acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet. \r\nNow I'll review our fiscal 2016 guidance. The company expects to grow sales by 0 to 1%, adjusted EBIT to grow by 3% to 5% and adjusted EPS to grow by 3% to 5% or $2.53 to $2.58 per share. This guidance includes the estimated negative impact of currency translation of 2 points across sales, EBIT and EPS. \r\nThis guidance also includes the impact of the Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition, which is estimated to contribute 1 point to sales and EBIT growth. \r\nThe acquisition is neutral at EPS, including the impact of reducing our anticipated share repurchases to repay the acquisition debt. \r\nExcluding the impacts from currency headwinds and the acquisition, these growth rates are within our long-term growth targets of 1% to 3% organic sales, 4% to 6% for adjusted EBIT and 5% to 7% for adjusted EPS. \r\nWhile we don't give quarterly guidance, I will say that we expect some sales headwinds in the first quarter given we're cycling a strong first quarter from last year and from timing related to our promotional strategies. \r\nAs announced this morning, we intend to adopt mark-to-market pension and postretirement benefit accounting in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 and recast our historical results. This change eliminates the deferral and subsequent amortization of historic actuarial gains and losses, which will be recognized as incurred. The periodic mark-to-market adjustments will be reflected as an item impacting comparability and therefore excluded from adjusted results. We believe this accounting change will improve the transparency of our results and year-to-year comparability. \r\nThe 2016 guidance does not reflect the impact of the anticipated accounting change. However, 2016 growth rates are not expected to change from the recasted 2015 base. \r\nAs we operationalize our new division structure beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we will move from our current 5 reporting segments to 3: Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, Global Biscuits and Snacks and Campbell Fresh. \r\nHistorical results reflecting both the new segments and change in accounting will be provided shortly after we file our first quarter 10-Q. \r\nTurning to some of the key assumptions underlying our guidance. We expect inflation and cost of products sold of approximately 2% to 3%, including the negative impact of a stronger U.S. dollar on the input costs of our international businesses. \r\nCost inflation will be offset by gains from our ongoing productivity program, which, excluding our ZBB initiative, is targeted at 3% of cost of products sold. \r\nWe expect our gross margin percentage to improve modestly as we continue to achieve net price realization and improve our supply chain performance. \r\nWe are approving incentive compensation below target levels in 2015 and anticipate a headwind of approximately $0.04 per share in 2016. \r\nThe effective tax rate is estimated to be in a range of 31% to 32% compared to the 2015 adjusted rate of 31%. \r\nThis guidance assumes about a $0.02 per share incremental contribution from share repurchases, which are expected to be at levels below fiscal 2015. \r\nWe are forecasting capital expenditures to decline by $30 million to approximately $350 million, which is more in line with our historical spending levels. \r\nIn fiscal 2015, we launched a comprehensive reorganization and a 3-year cost reduction initiative, leveraging a zero-based budgeting approach and targeting annual savings of $250 million. As shown on the chart, we have achieved about $85 million of savings in 2015 as we reduced headcount and realized savings across several cost categories. For 2016, we are targeting to increase the savings run rate to $145 million, which would put us more than halfway to our $250 million goal. Most of the 2016 gains will come in the selling and marketing and administrative expense lines. The majority of the more complex supply chain gains will come later in the program. \r\nTo implement the program, we estimate total program costs in the range of $250 million to $325 million. In fiscal 2015, we recognized costs totaling $124 million, which includes $22 million of implementation cost and $102 million of restructuring charges, principally severance as we implemented both a voluntary incentive separation program and headcount reductions as we streamlined our organization. Against this program, we estimate program costs of approximately $100 million in fiscal 2016. \r\nThat concludes my remarks. I'll now turn it back to Ken for the Q&A.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Anthony. We will now start our Q&A session. [Operator Instructions]",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Ken Gosnell (Executives)】\nThank you, Stephanie. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the fourth quarter earnings call for Campbell Soup's fiscal 2015. With me here in New Jersey are Denise Morrison, President and CEO; Anthony DiSilvestro, CFO; and Blake MacMinn, Senior Manager, Investor Relations. \r\nAs usual, we have created slides to accompany our earnings presentation. You will find the slides posted on our website this morning at investor.campbellsoupcompany.com. \r\nThis call is open to the media, who participate in a listen-only mode. \r\nToday, we will make forward-looking statements, which reflect our current expectations. These statements rely on assumptions and estimates, which could be inaccurate and are subject to risk. Please refer to our Slide 2 or our SEC filings for a list of factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements. \r\nNow I'd like to remind you about items impacting comparability. As we said in this morning's news release, in the fourth quarter, the company incurred charges associated with its initiatives to implement a new enterprise design that better aligns with our strategies, to reduce costs and to streamline organizational structure. \r\nThe company recorded pretax restructuring charges of $93 million related to the program and pretax charges of $13 million in administrative expenses related to the implementation of these initiatives. \r\nThe aggregate after-tax impact of the restructuring charges and implementation cost was $0.21 per share. \r\nLast year, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we recorded $21 million of pretax restructuring charges and restructuring-related costs. We also recorded an additional $4 million of pretax settlement charges associated with a U.S. pension plan. The aggregate after-tax impact of these items was $0.06 per share. \r\nAlso as a reminder, fiscal 2014 included 53 weeks with the extra week falling in the fourth quarter. The extra week was worth an estimated $129 million in net sales, $37 million in EBIT and $0.08 in EPS. The adjusted results exclude the impact of the additional week in the prior year. Our comparisons of the full year 2015 with 2014 will exclude previously announced items. \r\nBecause we use non-GAAP measures, we have provided a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is included in our appendix. \r\nLastly, please mark your calendars for our planned fiscal 2016 earnings dates. We plan to release first quarter earnings on November 24, which will include the new segments and pension and postretirement benefit accounting changes with the recasted prior year Q1 data. Shortly after we release our 10-Q, we will release the remaining recasted financials. The next 3 earnings dates are February 25, May 20 and September 1, 2016. \r\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Denise.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Denise Morrison (Executives)】\nThank you, Ken, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. This morning, I will offer my perspective on our performance, provide a progress report on several major strategic actions we initiated in 2015, including our redesigned enterprise structure and cost savings effort, and share my outlook and areas of focus for fiscal 2016. \r\nAt our Investor Day in July, I described how the food industry is in a period of revolutionary change, which presents both challenges and opportunities for Campbell. The changes in the industry are being driven by several seismic shifts: new global economic realities in the U.S. and abroad; major demographic changes and the redefinition of the American family; profound changes in consumer preferences for food with greater focus on health and well-being; and the impact of digital technologies on marketing, shopping and the growing demand for greater transparency about food. \r\nThe convergence and acceleration of these shifts are reshaping the consumer and retailer landscape. Combined with the prevailing industry dynamics of consolidation and cost cutting, these shifts are placing increased pressure on traditional center store categories and mainstream food companies. \r\nWith this as context, I'll focus my remarks this morning on our performance for fiscal 2015, review the important strategic actions we initiated during the year and highlight our key drivers for fiscal 2016. \r\nFirst, I'll briefly comment on our fourth quarter results. I'm pleased that we finished fiscal 2015 in line with our revised expectations. Sales in the fourth quarter reflected the tough consumer operating environment with organic sales increasing 1%. 3 of our 5 segments grew organic sales in the quarter. \r\nMore importantly, we made significant progress in our internal actions to address our supply chain issues related to shipping capacity and customer service. We also made substantial strides to improve our cost structure through our cost savings initiatives and enterprise redesign. \r\nWe reported the largest gross margin improvement in more than 6 years. Adjusted EBIT and earnings per share increased 5% in the fourth quarter. I was particularly pleased with the fourth quarter organic sales and earnings performance in U.S. Simple Meals as well as organic sales growth in Bolthouse and Foodservice. \r\nIn the quarter, we also completed the acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet, a fresh salsa and hummus business that will provide a platform for our further expansion in the deli section. \r\nTurning to our full year results. With a solid finish, we delivered sales, adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS consistent with our most recent guidance. Organic sales increased 1% with growth in 4 of our 5 reporting segments. Adjusted EBIT was down 2% for the year and adjusted gross margin declined 70 basis points for the year, within the range that we had expected. \r\nAs I look at the year, I'm pleased that our management team responded to our first half cost and margin challenges in a difficult operating environment. I am particularly encouraged with the improvement in gross margin we delivered in the back half and the fact that we posted organic sales growth in 4 of our 5 reporting segments. However, we recognize that we have more work to do. \r\nBefore Anthony provides you with a detailed review of our results, I will offer my perspective on several notable items, focusing on the full year. \r\nLooking at the year within U.S. Simple Meals, the performance of our sauce business was a standout, notably Prego and Campbell's Dinner Sauces. \r\nPrego had another strong year behind the success of our white sauces and overall product superiority. Sales of Campbell's Dinner Sauces increased double digits for the year. \r\nOur strategically important Plum business drove double-digit sales growth with new products and continued distribution gains, especially in the grocery channel. \r\nIn U.S. soup, consumer takeaway was relatively stable and we posted positive share performance. \r\nFor the year, our Global Baking and Snacking segment performed well. Organic sales increased 3% and operating earnings were up 5%. I feel particularly good about the improvement in Australian biscuits as the team made significant progress in this important core business. \r\nIn Southeast Asia, our Indonesia business delivered another year of double-digit growth, but sales declined in the fourth quarter as a result of worsening economic conditions in this market, which we expect to persist. \r\nWe had another year of decline in shelf-stable U.S. Beverages. While the category remains challenged, the underlining trends of our business are beginning to show signs of improvement. Consumer takeaway and share increased in the fourth quarter. Modest sales declines in the V8 Red juice were more than offset by the introduction of V8 Veggie Blends. Trial and repeat of Veggie Blends continue to meet expectations and depth of repeat remains strong. We expect our new advertising campaign to drive additional trial. V8 Splash, our powerhouse brand for kids, and V8 + Energy continue to perform well. In our immediate consumption channel, we're beginning to see some momentum. \r\nWe feel good about the overall direction of this business, but we still face challenges, particularly with the continued decline of our V-Fusion franchise. In fiscal 2016, the entire category will remain under significant pressure. While we expect our U.S. beverages businesses to improve, we're not planning on a return to growth. \r\nLet's now turn to the Bolthouse and Foodservice segment. As a reminder, Bolthouse Farms consists of the farms and CPG businesses. Farms include our retail fresh carrots business and our ingredients business, mainly carrot concentrate. CPG consists of our super premium beverages, ultra-premium beverages and refrigerated salad dressings. \r\nWe continue to be enthusiastic about Bolthouse Farms, especially the branded CPG business. \r\nFor the year, CPG sales increased high single digits. Gains were driven by product innovation, increased distribution for beverages and incremental shelf space at existing customers for our salad dressings. The initial rollout of our cold-pressed organic ultra-premium beverage line, 1915 by Bolthouse Farms, is off to a good start. \r\nAfter completing the acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet in June, we have begun integrating the business. Thus far, there have been no surprises, and we're pleased with the retailer response to our long-term plans. \r\nFiscal 2015 was an eventful year, and we took important steps to lay the foundation for the future. We redesigned our enterprise structure and our 3 new divisions are now operating in line with their declared portfolio roles. We established our Integrated Global Services organization and moved elements of finance, procurement, marketing, sales, HR and IT into this shared service group. It's early days, but we're off to a solid start. The focus in fiscal 2016 will be working smarter, creating efficiencies and reducing costs while starting to build new enterprise capabilities within this group. \r\nWe initiated plans for zero-based budgeting process. We're piloting ZBB in 2 cost categories in fiscal 2016 with plans to expand in the future. We believe this discipline will be of great value to Campbell going forward. \r\nWe're off to a very good start to realizing our $250 million cost savings target. We delivered earlier-than-expected savings of approximately $85 million across several categories, including headcount reductions, nonworking marketing, reduced travel expenses and spending on consultants. \r\nWe added another growth engine with the acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet to bolster our Campbell Fresh portfolio and extend our presence in the perimeter beyond produce into the deli section. \r\nWe initiated an important project to increase consumer trust by providing greater access to information about the ingredients we use and how we make our food. This is accelerating meaningful changes to our recipes. For instance, over time, we're planning to eliminate artificial colors and flavors from nearly all of our North American products. \r\nLooking ahead to fiscal 2016, we plan to deliver moderate growth in what we believe will continue to be a consumer environment marked by caution. \r\nAs we outlined at our Investor Day in July, starting in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we'll change our reporting segments, reflecting our 3 new divisions, each with a distinct portfolio role. \r\nIn our Americas Simple Meals and Beverages division, we will focus on driving moderate growth while expanding our margins. We'll deliver this by focusing on fewer bigger initiatives that will attract new consumers while driving additional consumption by our loyal core consumers. \r\nFor example, our Campbell's Fresh-Brewed soups in K-Cups will provide a new, convenient way for consumers to enjoy soup. This represents an incremental eating occasion that taps into the growing frequency of smaller meals and snacks. \r\nAdditionally, we'll take an industry leadership role by increasing our transparency efforts. We'll provide greater access to information about more of our North American products on the whatsinmyfood.com website. We also plan to do improve more of our recipes, consistent with our purpose. \r\nIn Global Biscuits and Snacks, we're focused on expanding in developed and developing markets while improving our margins. \r\nIn the developed markets of the United States and Australia, we're concentrating on restoring improved levels of growth. \r\nIn the U.S., we'll apply a disciplined focus to consumer-driven innovation, increased marketing behind our Goldfish and Milano brands and fuel growth in our fresh bakery portfolio. \r\nIn Australia, we'll continue to improve our core Shapes product and drive Tim Tam's momentum while shifting our marketing mix towards digital. \r\nWe'll also remain focused on faster-growing spaces, building on markets where we have a foothold such as Indonesia and China. We'll monitor and adjust to the economic conditions in both these countries throughout the year. We recognize that there may be short-term economic pressure in these markets. In the long term, we believe that it's essential to become more geographically diverse with a higher percentage of our business in faster-growing developing markets with an expanding middle class. \r\nIn the Campbell Fresh division, we'll make focused investments to accelerate sales growth and expand into new categories. As we outlined at Investor Day, our priorities are: to build on the successful launch of our ultra-premium offering, 1915. The product is in 2,000 stores today, and we expect to expand to 8,000 stores during the first quarter. \r\nWe will continue to accelerate our refrigerated salad dressing business through innovation and increased distribution. \r\nAnd finally, we will integrate the Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition and our existing refrigerated soup business into the Bolthouse Farms fresh platform and significantly expand our market penetration. \r\nWe expect our C-Fresh business to become a full force growth engine for Campbell. \r\nAcross all of our businesses, we'll continue to actively explore external development opportunities that make both strategic and economic sense. We will also remain focused on transforming our cost structure and culture. We're off to a promising start with our cost reduction efforts, but we must remain diligent and continue to create an ownership mindset where employees treat every dollar as if it were their own. \r\nIn closing, I'm cautious but optimistic about fiscal 2016. I believe that the strategic imperatives we're pursuing, purpose and transparency in our core business, digital marketing and e-commerce, health and well-being and expansion in developing markets, coupled with our divisions' clear portfolio roles, position us well for the year ahead. We're very clear eyed about our challenges, particularly driving sustainable sales growth, but we're now better organized and better prepared to meet those challenges head-on. We believe that our strategy to focus on driving growth, aggressively reducing cost and reinvesting a portion of the savings in the areas of our business with the greatest growth potential is the best way to create shareholder value. \r\nI look forward to answering your questions in a few minutes. Now let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Anthony DiSilvestro.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Anthony DiSilvestro (Executives)】\nThanks, Denise, and good morning. Before reviewing our results and guidance, I wanted to give you my perspective on our performance and future outlook. \r\nWe finished the year with a solid quarter. I'm very pleased with our gross margin performance in the fourth quarter, which improved by 180 basis points, benefiting from our price realization and productivity effort. The improved gross margin and earlier-than-expected cost reductions drove 5% gains in both adjusted EBIT and EPS for the quarter despite a 2-point negative impact from currency translation. We've made very good progress against our 3-year, $250 million cost savings target, delivering about $85 million of savings in fiscal 2015. For the full year, we delivered results within our recent guidance ranges with EPS of $2.46, at the top end of the range. \r\nLooking ahead to 2016, our guidance, when you exclude the impact of currency translation and the Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition, is within our new long-term targets. \r\nNow I'll review our results in more detail. For the fourth quarter, net sales on an as-reported basis declined 9% to $1.7 billion primarily due to the impact of 1 less week and the negative impact of currency translation. Excluding those factors and our recent acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet, organic net sales increased 1% in the quarter as we benefited from higher selling prices. \r\nAdjusted EBIT increased 5% to $234 million driven by a higher gross margin percentage, partly offset by higher incentive compensation expenses and a 2-point negative impact from currency translation. \r\nAdjusted EPS also increased by 5% to $0.43. \r\nFor the full year, reported net sales declined 2% with organic sales gaining 1% led by the strong performance of our Global Baking and Snacking segment. \r\nAdjusted EBIT declined 2% to $1.2 billion, reflecting a lower gross margin percentage, a 2-point negative impact from currency translation and higher incentive compensation expense, partly offset by volume gains and the benefit of our cost savings initiative. The decline in gross margin, down 70 basis points, was driven by higher-than-anticipated cost inflation and the supply chain issues we experienced in the first half, partly offset by productivity and pricing gains.  \r\nEPS of $2.46 was comparable to the prior year. \r\nDecomposing our sales performance for the quarter, as-reported sales declined 9% with organic sales increasing by 1%. Volume and mix subtracted 1 point, which was primarily in our Global Baking and Snacking and U.S. Beverages segments. \r\nHigher selling prices across 4 of our reportable segments added 1 point to sales. Reduced promotional spending contributed 1 point to sales growth, primarily driven by the Global Baking and Snacking segment. Currency translation had an adverse impact of 3 points. Our 2 primary foreign currencies, the Australian dollar and Canadian dollar, both continued to weaken against the U.S. dollar. \r\nOur recent acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet added 1 point to sales, and the impact of 1 less week subtracted 7 points. \r\nOur adjusted gross margin percentage increased by 180 basis points to 36.1%. For the quarter and moderating relative to earlier quarters, inflation increased by approximately 2%. Inflation and other factors had a negative impact on gross margin of 1.1 points.  Mix had a negative impact of 40 basis points. \r\nIn aggregate, our price realization actions have contributed 1.2 points of margin expansion with 40 basis points from reduced promotional spending, principally trade reductions in Pepperidge Farm, and 80 basis points from higher selling prices, primarily on condensed soups, Prego and in Canada. \r\nLastly, we continue to drive meaningful productivity gains in our supply chain, which contributed 210 basis points of margin improvement in the quarter. And overall, our operating efficiencies were above prior year levels. \r\nMarketing and selling expenses declined by 7% in the quarter, reflecting the impact of currency and reductions in selling expense and nonworking marketing, both benefiting from our cost management efforts, partly offset by an increase in advertising and consumer promotion expense. \r\nAdjusted administrative expenses increased 10%, driven by a higher incentive compensation cost compared to the prior year in which the expense was significantly below targeted levels. \r\nFor additional perspective on our performance, this chart breaks it -- down our EPS change between our operating performance and below-the-line items. \r\nAs you can see, adjusted EPS increased $0.02 compared with the prior year, increasing from $0.41 to $0.43 per share. On a currency-neutral basis, growth in adjusted EBIT contributed $0.04 to EPS. Net interest expense declined $3 million, about $0.01 per share, primarily due to the impact of 1 less week. \r\nWith $200 million of share repurchases throughout the year under our strategic share repurchase program, this has reduced our share count and added $0.01 to EPS in the quarter. \r\nGoing the other way, our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 34.8%, up 80 basis points versus the prior year, reflecting a shift in the mix between U.S. and foreign earnings and negatively impacted EPS by $0.01. \r\nCurrency had a $0.01 negative impact on EPS in the quarter, completing the bridge to $0.43. \r\nNow turning to our segment results. In Global Baking and Snacking, our largest sales segment in the quarter, organic sales increased 1% as growth in Pepperidge Farm and Arnott's were partly offset by a decline in Kelsen. Sales gains in Pepperidge Farm were driven by fresh bakery, Goldfish crackers and frozen products, partly offset by a decline in cookies. Organic growth in Arnott’s reflected gains in Australia, partly offset by a decline in Indonesia. \r\nOperating earnings declined 26%, driven by the impact of 1 less week, higher marketing and administrative expenses, principally incentive compensation, currency translation and impairment charges to minor trademarks, partly offset by gross margin expansion. Excluding the impact of 1 less week, currency translation and the impairment charges, operating profit increased in the quarter. \r\nIn U.S. Simple Meals, organic sales increased 4%. While dollar consumption of soup in measured channels increased 1%, movements in retail inventory levels contributed to sales gains in the quarter. \r\nAs you may recall, movements in retail inventory levels had a negative impact on third quarter sales, and we're experiencing the opposite effect in the fourth quarter. We ended the year with retail inventory levels comparable to the prior year. \r\nOrganic sales in other simple meals increased, driven by the continued strong growth of Prego pasta sauce. \r\nSegment sales also benefited from higher selling prices in condensed soups and Prego pasta sauce. \r\nOperating earnings increased 4%, reflecting organic sales growth, productivity improvements and benefits from our cost savings initiatives, partly offset by cost inflation and the impact of 1 less week. \r\nIn the Bolthouse and Foodservice segment, organic sales increased 4% with growth in Bolthouse Farms beverages and salad dressings and North America Foodservice, partly offset by declines in Bolthouse Farms carrots. \r\nOperating earnings fell 3% on higher administrative expenses and the impact of 1 less week. \r\nU.S. beverage organic sales fell 4% primarily due to volume losses in V8 V-Fusion. While consumer takeaway dollar sales in measured channels was positive, sales were negatively impacted by reductions in retail inventory levels and sales declines in the club channel. Operating earnings declined 23% due to the sales decline, including the impact of 1 less week. \r\nInternational Simple Meals and Beverages organic sales declined 5% from weakness in Canada and Australia. Operating earnings declined $10 million or 48% primarily due to volume declines, including the impact of 1 less week, and currency translation. \r\nThis chart shows the as-reported sales performance of U.S. soup unadjusted for the impact of 1 less week, which subtracted 7 points in the quarter and 1 point for the full year. \r\nFor the quarter, U.S. soup sales declined 2% with condensed down 4%, ready-to-serve down 3% and broth up 11%. Excluding the impact of one less week, sales of condensed soups increased with gains in both eating and cooking varieties driven by net price realization. \r\nSales of ready-to-serve soup also increased, excluding the impact of 1 less week, primarily driven by the launches of our fresh-brewed soup for Keurig and our line of organic soups. The double-digit sales gain on Swanson broth was primarily led by aseptic varieties. \r\nFor the fiscal year, as shown towards the bottom of the chart, soup sales declined 3% versus the prior year as a 3% decline in condensed and a 5% decline in ready-to-serve were partly offset by 3% growth in broth. \r\nHere's the U.S. wet soup category performance and our share results as measured by IRI. \r\nFor the 52-week period ending August 2, 2015, the category as a whole declined 0.9%. Our sales in measured channels declined 0.7% with weakness in ready-to-serve soups partly offset by gains in broth. Our share increased 10 basis points in the last 52 weeks and has now been relatively stable for 3 years. \r\nOther branded players in aggregate had a share of 28.1%, declining 30 basis points, while private label with a 12.6% share gained 20 basis points. \r\nWe had strong cash flow performance in fiscal 2015. Cash from operations increased by $283 million to almost $1.2 billion, driven by lower working capital requirements, wrapping the taxes paid in 2014 on the divestiture of the European Simple Meals business and lower pension contributions. \r\nCapital expenditures increased to $380 million as we increased capacities in Goldfish, Bolthouse Farms beverages, broth in North America and biscuits in Indonesia. \r\nWe paid dividends totaling $394 million, reflecting our current quarterly dividend rate of $0.312 per share. \r\nIn aggregate, we repurchased 244 million of shares in fiscal 2015, 200 million of which were under our strategic share repurchase program. The balance of the repurchases were made to offset dilution from equity-based compensation. \r\nNet debt increased by approximately $60 million to $3.8 billion as gains in cash flow were more than offset by the $232 million acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet. \r\nNow I'll review our fiscal 2016 guidance. The company expects to grow sales by 0 to 1%, adjusted EBIT to grow by 3% to 5% and adjusted EPS to grow by 3% to 5% or $2.53 to $2.58 per share. This guidance includes the estimated negative impact of currency translation of 2 points across sales, EBIT and EPS. \r\nThis guidance also includes the impact of the Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition, which is estimated to contribute 1 point to sales and EBIT growth. \r\nThe acquisition is neutral at EPS, including the impact of reducing our anticipated share repurchases to repay the acquisition debt. \r\nExcluding the impacts from currency headwinds and the acquisition, these growth rates are within our long-term growth targets of 1% to 3% organic sales, 4% to 6% for adjusted EBIT and 5% to 7% for adjusted EPS. \r\nWhile we don't give quarterly guidance, I will say that we expect some sales headwinds in the first quarter given we're cycling a strong first quarter from last year and from timing related to our promotional strategies. \r\nAs announced this morning, we intend to adopt mark-to-market pension and postretirement benefit accounting in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 and recast our historical results. This change eliminates the deferral and subsequent amortization of historic actuarial gains and losses, which will be recognized as incurred. The periodic mark-to-market adjustments will be reflected as an item impacting comparability and therefore excluded from adjusted results. We believe this accounting change will improve the transparency of our results and year-to-year comparability. \r\nThe 2016 guidance does not reflect the impact of the anticipated accounting change. However, 2016 growth rates are not expected to change from the recasted 2015 base. \r\nAs we operationalize our new division structure beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we will move from our current 5 reporting segments to 3: Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, Global Biscuits and Snacks and Campbell Fresh. \r\nHistorical results reflecting both the new segments and change in accounting will be provided shortly after we file our first quarter 10-Q. \r\nTurning to some of the key assumptions underlying our guidance. We expect inflation and cost of products sold of approximately 2% to 3%, including the negative impact of a stronger U.S. dollar on the input costs of our international businesses. \r\nCost inflation will be offset by gains from our ongoing productivity program, which, excluding our ZBB initiative, is targeted at 3% of cost of products sold. \r\nWe expect our gross margin percentage to improve modestly as we continue to achieve net price realization and improve our supply chain performance. \r\nWe are approving incentive compensation below target levels in 2015 and anticipate a headwind of approximately $0.04 per share in 2016. \r\nThe effective tax rate is estimated to be in a range of 31% to 32% compared to the 2015 adjusted rate of 31%. \r\nThis guidance assumes about a $0.02 per share incremental contribution from share repurchases, which are expected to be at levels below fiscal 2015. \r\nWe are forecasting capital expenditures to decline by $30 million to approximately $350 million, which is more in line with our historical spending levels. \r\nIn fiscal 2015, we launched a comprehensive reorganization and a 3-year cost reduction initiative, leveraging a zero-based budgeting approach and targeting annual savings of $250 million. As shown on the chart, we have achieved about $85 million of savings in 2015 as we reduced headcount and realized savings across several cost categories. For 2016, we are targeting to increase the savings run rate to $145 million, which would put us more than halfway to our $250 million goal. Most of the 2016 gains will come in the selling and marketing and administrative expense lines. The majority of the more complex supply chain gains will come later in the program. \r\nTo implement the program, we estimate total program costs in the range of $250 million to $325 million. In fiscal 2015, we recognized costs totaling $124 million, which includes $22 million of implementation cost and $102 million of restructuring charges, principally severance as we implemented both a voluntary incentive separation program and headcount reductions as we streamlined our organization. Against this program, we estimate program costs of approximately $100 million in fiscal 2016. \r\nThat concludes my remarks. I'll now turn it back to Ken for the Q&A.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Ken Gosnell (Executives)】\nThanks, Anthony. We will now start our Q&A session. [Operator Instructions]",
      "transcript_text3": "The gross margin expansion, obviously, was much higher than what we all expected. And I'm -- I don't know, have you given any specific guidance for what kind of expansion you expect in fiscal '16? And also, was there any help in the quarter resulting from kind of like the mismatch of incremental cost that you took on in first and second quarter, Anthony? I remember there was some noise there related to some inefficiencies for extra cost that needed to be spread out over multiple quarters. Did that influence the fourth quarter expansion at all?\n\n---\n\nSo Rob, let me comment on the fourth quarter and I'll come back to 2016. The fourth quarter comp is fairly clean. The only thing that gave us some advantage this year relative to last year is the timing of the mark-to-market adjustment on our commodity hedges. So we had a little bit of favorability this year relative to last year. So a small portion of that 180 basis points is that and the rest is improvement in the operating performance of the business. In terms of 2016, as I said in my remarks, we expect to see a modest improvement in our gross margin percentage. And I think the way to think about it, there's a number of positives and a number of negatives. On the positive side, our annual COPS productivity program, where we target 3% of costs, obviously that's the most significant benefit. We expect to see continued benefit on net price realization, mostly from the pricing actions that we've taken in the back half of this year. We do expect to see some margin improvement from improved supply chain performance year-on-year given the challenges we had in the first half of last year. On the negative side, 3 things to mention. One is cost inflation, which we expect to be about 2% to 3%, and that includes the negative impact of currency on the input costs of a number of our international businesses. It also includes some negative mix. And lastly, the cost of some quality improvements we're making in some of our -- both our products and packaging.\n\n---\n\nDenise, I wanted to ask about Global Baking and Snacking and the volume pressure there. Maybe if you could address in a bit more detail some of that pressured in Asia, particularly, I guess, Kelsen in China. And in the U.S. cookie business and the softness here, it seems that Pepperidge pricing really began to outpace the category over the past few months. Are you seeing some elasticity impact there? And how are you thinking about that for fiscal '16?\n\n---\n\nYes. Let me start first with our core business in the United States and Australia. We are pleased with the share in consumption of Goldfish crackers and, in particular, Milano. Although we did experience in the quarter some softness in cookies, that was pretty much as expected because we in the biscuit business in the United States particularly in the quarter, we did not promote as heavily as last year because the promotions were not as productive as we would have expected. So that was pretty deliberate. But we expect moderate growth in the United States on our biscuit business. In the Australian business, we're really happy with the year that we had there. That has been a pretty remarkable turnaround. We were challenged in Australia for a couple of years, and they have now posted really outstanding results. And it's been really on the fundamentals: better advertising, more innovation, more brand building, more digital. So we believe that the building blocks they've put in place there are very sustainable. We had a great year in Indonesia with double-digit growth, but we did have a slow fourth quarter. And you -- all you have to do is pick up a newspaper to see what's going on in Asia these days. But we're watching that very carefully, and we believe -- look, we have a lot of runway in Indonesia to expand our distribution points, but we're going to be very responsible about that business in '16. And then the Kelsen business, this is a very small quarter for Kelsen. The sales are skewed in China, largely toward Chinese New Year. But that said, we did have some inventory overhang from Chinese New Year this year, and we're working through that right now and that hit us predominantly in the fourth quarter.\n\n---\n\nJust a quick question, if I could then. I just want to get a sense of the degree of promotional spending and what you expect that to do across the year. I know every business is different, and I'm sure probably you have expectations for each business. But is there an overall comment you can make on promotional spending? And maybe related to that, advertising, I'm not sure I heard, and what you  expect for the advertising spending for the year.\n\n---\n\nYes. We are continuing to manage our trade promotions to maximize our profitable volume. We're maintaining a focus on competitive activity in both our customer programs and in our consumer response. And we are, as noted, looking for opportunities to improve our trade spending not only for ourselves to get a better return but also for our customers to get a better return. And so there is no real strategy to cut back, but there definitely is improved analytics and revenue management. So we have a much more productive trade spend. In total, our advertising, consumer and trade, was about 24% of sales, which we try and aim for about 24% to 25% as a rule.\n\n---\n\nFirst, a quick housekeeping question. Can you guys quantify what the 2015 EPS base is going to look like post the recasting related to pension accounting?\n\n---\n\nSure, I can do that. I think the way to think about it is in the 2015, the amortization within our pension expense is going to be about $100 million pretax, and that's a good proxy for the impact of the accounting change when we -- when you get through a bunch of pluses and minuses. And I think a couple additional points on this, these plans have been closed to new hires for a couple of years now. They're very well funded. We ended the year at 97% to 98% in terms of funded status, and we don't expect to make any contributions to our U.S. plans in 2016.\n\n---\n\nThat's helpful. And you mentioned ZBB focused on 2 cost categories. Can you specify what categories those are?\n\n---\n\nYes, we did a pilot program on our nonworking marketing and also on the consulting.\n\n---\n\nAnd on marketing, it's -- you're focused on more productivity there. It's down around 17% from your fiscal '10 high. How much further can you go? And as you try to sort of balance and walk the line of containing promotions, and I think it's encouraging to see the promotions actually be a positive contributor to sales, can you do both at the same time? Can you continue to hold the line in marketing and find efficiencies there while, at the same time, pulling back or finding efficiencies on trade spend? Or is it an either or-type situation as you think about the forward?\n\n---\n\nSo I think that we look at the marketing mix as the 3 elements of advertising, consumer and trade. And of course, that mix is going to vary by business in terms of what degree we spend. But we do have some shifts going on. As Anthony alluded to, we are making a conscious effort to reduce our nonworking marketing where it's not a productive spend. The second is within advertising, we are shifting more dollars out of conventional TV and more into digital. And that spend has been shifting over time but will be up to 40% going forward. And then we're -- we try it, again, for ACT to stay in the range of about 24% to 25% of sales, and that's remained pretty constant over the last couple of years.\n\n---\n\nReal quick one. Regarding U.S. Simple Meals, and I -- forgive me if you mentioned this, but you talked about positive movements in retailer inventory levels. Can you elaborate a bit on how much that's helped? And what happened that your customers', I guess, loading up a bit on purchases versus the prior year?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think it's more about how we came into the quarter. If you'll recall the third quarter, I think our sales were down 10% while our consumption was only down 1%. So we came into the quarter with inventory levels down. We ended the quarter with -- and the year with retail inventories about where they were a year ago. So in the fourth quarter, while our consumption was plus 1%, our organic sales were plus about 5%. So we had about 4 points of lift from that shift in inventory.\n\n---\n\nAnd then a quick one if I can. Denise, in terms of U.S. cookies, your 2 main competitors have made some DSD investment there. Can you talk about where you think those investments have affected your business at all negatively and whether you might want to add to your capability there to match what some of your peers have done?\n\n---\n\nYes. And I can't comment really on competition's investments, but I can say that we continue to be very supportive of our independent distributor network. They are a large part of our business model, and we'll continue to build the business alongside of them.\n\n---\n\nDenise, I just wanted to touch on the -- come back to the outlook for U.S. Beverages. In 2016, it sounds like you're still cautious definitely from a sales perspective. But is it possible that we could begin to see some improvement in margin or profit growth? And as you think about the growth profile of that business, given how persistent volume declines have been, do you think there may be an opportunity to perhaps take a more profit maximizing approach, perhaps focus a little bit more on pricing realization?\n\n---\n\nWe're doing both. And obviously, the category itself has been under a lot of pressure based on the consumer. And so what we've been really focused on is how do we broaden our line and better deliver on the things that consumers are looking for in vegetable juices. And we believe that vegetable juices have an advantage based on the consumer trends. We've learned a lot from Bolthouse. And actually, our V8 Veggie Blends reflect a broadening of vegetable-based beverages very -- based on consumer preferences for those particular flavor profiles, and we think that, that is really taking the business in the right direction. That said, we still have some -- a leaky bucket in our V8 V-Fusion that we're dealing with. Our V8 Splash and V8 + Energy are doing really well, and our immediate consumption has now posted the second quarter of growth. So we've got some good signs on the growth curve but more things working than not. But we still are cautious about declaring victory yet. The other thing we're working on is a mastering complexity project in our supply chain, which we believe will have a really positive impact on our profit going forward. But that is a longer-term play.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And just to come back to some of the more on-trend new products like V8 Veggie Blends. Is that something -- maybe not initially but something that you feel can be rolled out in a more of a margin-neutral way given the -- given sort of the added quality components of it?\n\n---\n\nIt -- the brand Veggie Blends is showing some really good trial and repeat, and we believe we do have to invest marketing to drive the trial because the repeat is so strong. And building a new product today is heavy lifting, and so making sure that we break through and we're supporting the brands we've put out there is an important idea.\n\n---\n\nJust a quick question about just the COPS inflation assumption for 2016. Can you just give us some color around where the inflation pressure is, especially most -- more recently you've seen some commodity movements that would presumably be more favorable? And also, just to what degree your inflation assumption for 2016 reflects some incremental costs related to the -- like ingredient changes.\n\n---\n\nSure, I can give you a little more color on that. So overall, like I said earlier, that's cost inflation of about 2% to 3%. If you parse that apart and look at the core ingredients in packaging and energy component, it's about 1%. And within that, the key drivers would be -- is -- about 5 categories: vegetables, flavors, sweeteners, chocolates, and we have a significant increase in -- as a result of the avian flu in both eggs and pasta. On eggs, we're looking at inflation rate of close to 50% in fiscal '16. So those are the key drivers of the 1%. Then on top of that, there's a couple of other items. So first will be, and I alluded to it, the FX impact of input costs on our Canadian business and the Australian business is fairly significant. And then the other couple of pieces. One would be wage rates within the supply chain, and also benefits, both health care and pension. And in terms of the commodities, because you mentioned some of the prices coming down, we're locked in to about 75% of our commodities for fiscal '16.\n\n---\n\nOne question I had. The -- I wanted to get more detail about the -- you mentioned the retailer inventories, particularly within Simple Meals. Any kind of detail you can give us about how sustainable those are, particularly in broth where sales are particularly strong? What kind of went on? And maybe more detail by channel. I know you discussed that a little bit, but are there any particular retailers who are moving inventories around in a way that affected profit this quarter?\n\n---\n\nNo. Other than the comment I made earlier that we came into the quarter with inventory below last year, I mean, it's kind of a rocky road. We started the year and ended the year about the same place, right, which isn't a lot of retail inventories. The issue that we saw all throughout the year was the quarterly volatility, starting with the first quarter with the timing of the holidays changed because we had 1 less week in the fiscal year, and that -- and then some timing in the third quarter where we pulled back quite a bit on some of our promotional activity in soup, and that led to some reduction in retailer inventories that corrected in the fourth quarter. And I would say, again, we ended the year at relatively low levels comparable to a year ago, and I don't -- so I don't -- can't think of any particular anomaly within that, Jonathan.\n\n---\n\nRight. Just my views are really that inventory movement is largely a function of promotional activity. And as we're noting, the activity is not consistent quarter-to-quarter, and inventory changes are largely individual customer decisions. So those are 3 other points that round out the discussion.\n\n---\n\nDenise, I wanted to ask a little bit about this new segment, Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, and just really to ask about the margin opportunity that's there for the segment. And I want to say something, that I feel like that there's been almost a basic philosophical shift here such that the focused moves from what I perceive in the past as this kind of maniacal focus on volumes to a very different business focus for that segment now just going to profit. So number one, am I right? Am I overstating kind of this philosophical shift? And can you give us some dimensions on the margin opportunity? And I'm not too concerned about the time line. This is not a fiscal '16 question, I really want to understand big picture where it's going.\n\n---\n\nYes. I think expecting that business to grow moderately at the top line and expand margins is a more balanced approach to the portfolio in terms of expecting these categories to do what they can do. And that doesn't mean that we won't have pockets of growth. For example, the Plum business resides in that category or in that division, and we expect robust growth from Plum. We also are not taking our foot off the gas on innovation, but we're being a lot more selective about the innovation we put into the marketplace because we're in a different place. And a couple of years ago, we didn't have a pipeline, and so what happened as a result are some little ideas got out into the marketplace. Today, we have built a pipeline, and we could be more choiceful about the larger ideas where we know we're going to get an impact from. And so I think this is a much more responsible way to run this business, and we believe that we can deliver better value for our shareholders with this approach.\n\n---\n\nBut is there any way to kind of put a sort of guideline to this margin expansion? I mean, I'm trying to get a sense of just is this 10, 20 basis points a year. Or is this something that has bigger potential than that?\n\n---\n\nI would say -- I mean, put it this way. I think there's an opportunity over time to grow the profit in that division above the company target.\n\n---\n\nYes. And it has been eroded for the past couple of years. So by the -- getting into our cost structure and getting into the discipline of zero-based budgeting, we're going to be able to do this in a very surgical way so that it sticks and is sustainable.\n\n---\n\nI wanted to ask about the soup category. So we're heading into the start of the soup season here. It seems just anecdotally the category is a little promotional. I'm sure it's probably promotional every fall because it is the high season. Could you talk a little bit about what you're seeing on shelves and from the retailers in terms of the levels of support they're looking for? And is there any divergence from what you've seen around this time kind of every year?\n\n---\n\nYes. It's early days in the season. Right now, what we're focused on is making sure that our shelf space is intact and the products are merchandised correctly on shelf. We have new products that are being cut in like the K-Cups and organic soup, making sure that, that's sufficiently placed. Our Campbell sales team is working with customers on a robust promotion schedule, and -- but pretty consistent with what we've had in prior years. So at this point in time, I don't see anything unusual. I don't know, Anthony, if you have anything to add.\n\n---\n\nNo, none, Denise.\n\n---\n\nNo?\n\n---\n\nAnd the K-Cups, how will you account for those? Are those -- what do you consider those? Condensed or ready-to-serve?\n\n---\n\nWe actually believe they'll be largely incremental to the category because it is an incremental usage occasion, going after soup as a snack. We believe that there's a great overlap between our Campbell Soup users and Keurig users, and our research has confirmed that. We are shelving it in the coffee aisle in about 70% of the retail environment, and that's basically because we believe that people who are interested in buying K-Cups will see this as a real positive in terms of expanding the usage of their dispensers into new categories and new usage occasions. And we have 2 pack sizes, 1 designed to drive trial, which we're situating in the soup aisle, and then the -- and that's a 2-count pack; and then a 6-count pack in the coffee aisle. So we -- we're pretty excited about it. It's going to be different, but we believe that the space has really been a game changer for coffee and we expect some good things from it.\n\n---\n\nAnd the segment classification -- it's a good question, and I'd have to think about that. And what we'll do is when we get to the first quarter, I'll make sure I highlight which segment we put that in.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And how many flavors are in the K-Cup?\n\n---\n\nI think right now it's just 2.\n\n---\n\nYes, 2.\n\n---\n\nThank you, everyone, for joining our fourth quarter call and webcast.

The fourth quarter comp is fairly clean. The only thing that gave us some advantage this year relative to last year is the timing of the mark-to-market adjustment on our commodity hedges. So we had a little bit of favorability this year relative to last year. So a small portion of that 180 basis points is that and the rest is improvement in the operating performance of the business.

We do expect to see some margin improvement from improved supply chain performance year-on-year given the challenges we had in the first half of last year. On the negative side, 3 things to mention. One is cost inflation, which we expect to be about 2% to 3%, and that includes the negative impact of currency on the input costs of a number of our international businesses. It also includes some negative mix. And lastly, the cost of some quality improvements we're making in some of our -- both our products and packaging.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Baumgartner (Analysts)】\nDenise, I wanted to ask about Global Baking and Snacking and the volume pressure there. Maybe if you could address in a bit more detail some of that pressured in Asia, particularly, I guess, Kelsen in China. And in the U.S. cookie business and the softness here, it seems that Pepperidge pricing really began to outpace the category over the past few months. Are you seeing some elasticity impact there? And how are you thinking about that for fiscal '16?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Denise Morrison (Executives)】\nYes. Let me start first with our core business in the United States and Australia. We are pleased with the share in consumption of Goldfish crackers and, in particular, Milano. Although we did experience in the quarter some softness in cookies, that was pretty much as expected because we in the biscuit business in the United States particularly in the quarter, we did not promote as heavily as last year because the promotions were not as productive as we would have expected. So that was pretty deliberate. But we expect moderate growth in the United States on our biscuit business. In the Australian business, we're really happy with the year that we had there. That has been a pretty remarkable turnaround. We were challenged in Australia for a couple of years, and they have now posted really outstanding results. And it's been really on the fundamentals: better advertising, more innovation, more brand building, more digital. So we believe that the building blocks they've put in place there are very sustainable. We had a great year in Indonesia with double-digit growth, but we did have a slow fourth quarter. And you -- all you have to do is pick up a newspaper to see what's going on in Asia these days. But we're watching that very carefully, and we believe -- look, we have a lot of runway in Indonesia to expand our distribution points, but we're going to be very responsible about that business in '16. And then the Kelsen business, this is a very small quarter for Kelsen. The sales are skewed in China, largely toward Chinese New Year. But that said, we did have some inventory overhang from Chinese New Year this year, and we're working through that right now and that hit us predominantly in the fourth quarter.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Christopher Growe (Analysts)】\nJust a quick question, if I could then. I just want to get a sense of the degree of promotional spending and what you expect that to do across the year. I know every business is different, and I'm sure probably you have expectations for each business. But is there an overall comment you can make on promotional spending? And maybe related to that, advertising, I'm not sure I heard, and what you  expect for the advertising spending for the year.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Denise Morrison (Executives)】\nYes. We are continuing to manage our trade promotions to maximize our profitable volume. We're maintaining a focus on competitive activity in both our customer programs and in our consumer response. And we are, as noted, looking for opportunities to improve our trade spending not only for ourselves to get a better return but also for our customers to get a better return. And so there is no real strategy to cut back, but there definitely is improved analytics and revenue management. So we have a much more productive trade spend. In total, our advertising, consumer and trade, was about 24% of sales, which we try and aim for about 24% to 25% as a rule.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jason English (Analysts)】\nFirst, a quick housekeeping question. Can you guys quantify what the 2015 EPS base is going to look like post the recasting related to pension accounting?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Anthony DiSilvestro (Executives)】\nSure, I can do that. I think the way to think about it is in the 2015, the amortization within our pension expense is going to be about $100 million pretax, and that's a good proxy for the impact of the accounting change when we -- when you get through a bunch of pluses and minuses. And I think a couple additional points on this, these plans have been closed to new hires for a couple of years now. They're very well funded. We ended the year at 97% to 98% in terms of funded status, and we don't expect to make any contributions to our U.S. plans in 2016.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jason English (Analysts)】\nThat's helpful. And you mentioned ZBB focused on 2 cost categories. Can you specify what categories those are?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Anthony DiSilvestro (Executives)】\nYes, we did a pilot program on our nonworking marketing and also on the consulting.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jason English (Analysts)】\nAnd on marketing, it's -- you're focused on more productivity there. It's down around 17% from your fiscal '10 high. How much further can you go? And as you try to sort of balance and walk the line of containing promotions, and I think it's encouraging to see the promotions actually be a positive contributor to sales, can you do both at the same time? Can you continue to hold the line in marketing and find efficiencies there while, at the same time, pulling back or finding efficiencies on trade spend? Or is it an either or-type situation as you think about the forward?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Denise Morrison (Executives)】\nSo I think that we look at the marketing mix as the 3 elements of advertising, consumer and trade. And of course, that mix is going to vary by business in terms of what degree we spend. But we do have some shifts going on. As Anthony alluded to, we are making a conscious effort to reduce our nonworking marketing where it's not a productive spend. The second is within advertising, we are shifting more dollars out of conventional TV and more into digital. And that spend has been shifting over time but will be up to 40% going forward. And then we're -- we try it, again, for ACT to stay in the range of about 24% to 25% of sales, and that's remained pretty constant over the last couple of years.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kenneth Goldman (Analysts)】\nReal quick one. Regarding U.S. Simple Meals, and I -- forgive me if you mentioned this, but you talked about positive movements in retailer inventory levels. Can you elaborate a bit on how much that's helped? And what happened that your customers', I guess, loading up a bit on purchases versus the prior year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Anthony DiSilvestro (Executives)】\nYes, I think it's more about how we came into the quarter. If you'll recall the third quarter, I think our sales were down 10% while our consumption was only down 1%. So we came into the quarter with inventory levels down. We ended the quarter with -- and the year with retail inventories about where they were a year ago. So in the fourth quarter, while our consumption was plus 1%, our organic sales were plus about 5%. So we had about 4 points of lift from that shift in inventory.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kenneth Goldman (Analysts)】\nAnd then a quick one if I can. Denise, in terms of U.S. cookies, your 2 main competitors have made some DSD investment there. Can you talk about where you think those investments have affected your business at all negatively and whether you might want to add to your capability there to match what some of your peers have done?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Denise Morrison (Executives)】\nYes. And I can't comment really on competition's investments, but I can say that we continue to be very supportive of our independent distributor network. They are a large part of our business model, and we'll continue to build the business alongside of them.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matthew Grainger (Analysts)】\nDenise, I just wanted to touch on the -- come back to the outlook for U.S. Beverages. In 2016, it sounds like you're still cautious definitely from a sales perspective. But is it possible that we could begin to see some improvement in margin or profit growth? And as you think about the growth profile of that business, given how persistent volume declines have been, do you think there may be an opportunity to perhaps take a more profit maximizing approach, perhaps focus a little bit more on pricing realization?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Denise Morrison (Executives)】\nWe're doing both. And obviously, the category itself has been under a lot of pressure based on the consumer. And so what we've been really focused on is how do we broaden our line and better deliver on the things that consumers are looking for in vegetable juices. And we believe that vegetable juices have an advantage based on the consumer trends. We've learned a lot from Bolthouse. And actually, our V8 Veggie Blends reflect a broadening of vegetable-based beverages very -- based on consumer preferences for those particular flavor profiles, and we think that, that is really taking the business in the right direction. That said, we still have some -- a leaky bucket in our V8 V-Fusion that we're dealing with. Our V8 Splash and V8 + Energy are doing really well, and our immediate consumption has now posted the second quarter of growth. So we've got some good signs on the growth curve but more things working than not. But we still are cautious about declaring victory yet. The other thing we're working on is a mastering complexity project in our supply chain, which we believe will have a really positive impact on our profit going forward. But that is a longer-term play.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matthew Grainger (Analysts)】\nOkay. And just to come back to some of the more on-trend new products like V8 Veggie Blends. Is that something -- maybe not initially but something that you feel can be rolled out in a more of a margin-neutral way given the -- given sort of the added quality components of it?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Denise Morrison (Executives)】\nIt -- the brand Veggie Blends is showing some really good trial and repeat, and we believe we do have to invest marketing to drive the trial because the repeat is so strong. And building a new product today is heavy lifting, and so making sure that we break through and we're supporting the brands we've put out there is an important idea.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Bryan Spillane (Analysts)】\nJust a quick question about just the COPS inflation assumption for 2016. Can you just give us some color around where the inflation pressure is, especially most -- more recently you've seen some commodity movements that would presumably be more favorable? And also, just to what degree your inflation assumption for 2016 reflects some incremental costs related to the -- like ingredient changes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Anthony DiSilvestro (Executives)】\nSure, I can give you a little more color on that. So overall, like I said earlier, that's cost inflation of about 2% to 3%. If you parse that apart and look at the core ingredients in packaging and energy component, it's about 1%. And within that, the key drivers would be -- is -- about 5 categories: vegetables, flavors, sweeteners, chocolates, and we have a significant increase in -- as a result of the avian flu in both eggs and pasta. On eggs, we're looking at inflation rate of close to 50% in fiscal '16. So those are the key drivers of the 1%. Then on top of that, there's a couple of other items. So first will be, and I alluded to it, the FX impact of input costs on our Canadian business and the Australian business is fairly significant. And then the other couple of pieces. One would be wage rates within the supply chain, and also benefits, both health care and pension. And in terms of the commodities, because you mentioned some of the prices coming down, we're locked in to about 75% of our commodities for fiscal '16.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jonathan Feeney (Analysts)】\nOne question I had. The -- I wanted to get more detail about the -- you mentioned the retailer inventories, particularly within Simple Meals. Any kind of detail you can give us about how sustainable those are, particularly in broth where sales are particularly strong? What kind of went on? And maybe more detail by channel. I know you discussed that a little bit, but are there any particular retailers who are moving inventories around in a way that affected profit this quarter?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Anthony DiSilvestro (Executives)】\nNo. Other than the comment I made earlier that we came into the quarter with inventory below last year, I mean, it's kind of a rocky road. We started the year and ended the year about the same place, right, which isn't a lot of retail inventories. The issue that we saw all throughout the year was the quarterly volatility, starting with the first quarter with the timing of the holidays changed because we had 1 less week in the fiscal year, and that -- and then some timing in the third quarter where we pulled back quite a bit on some of our promotional activity in soup, and that led to some reduction in retailer inventories that corrected in the fourth quarter. And I would say, again, we ended the year at relatively low levels comparable to a year ago, and I don't -- so I don't -- can't think of any particular anomaly within that, Jonathan.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Denise Morrison (Executives)】\nRight. Just my views are really that inventory movement is largely a function of promotional activity. And as we're noting, the activity is not consistent quarter-to-quarter, and inventory changes are largely individual customer decisions. So those are 3 other points that round out the discussion.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Driscoll (Analysts)】\nDenise, I wanted to ask a little bit about this new segment, Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, and just really to ask about the margin opportunity that's there for the segment. And I want to say something, that I feel like that there's been almost a basic philosophical shift here such that the focused moves from what I perceive in the past as this kind of maniacal focus on volumes to a very different business focus for that segment now just going to profit. So number one, am I right? Am I overstating kind of this philosophical shift? And can you give us some dimensions on the margin opportunity? And I'm not too concerned about the time line. This is not a fiscal '16 question, I really want to understand big picture where it's going.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Denise Morrison (Executives)】\nYes. I think expecting that business to grow moderately at the top line and expand margins is a more balanced approach to the portfolio in terms of expecting these categories to do what they can do. And that doesn't mean that we won't have pockets of growth. For example, the Plum business resides in that category or in that division, and we expect robust growth from Plum. We also are not taking our foot off the gas on innovation, but we're being a lot more selective about the innovation we put into the marketplace because we're in a different place. And a couple of years ago, we didn't have a pipeline, and so what happened as a result are some little ideas got out into the marketplace. Today, we have built a pipeline, and we could be more choiceful about the larger ideas where we know we're going to get an impact from. And so I think this is a much more responsible way to run this business, and we believe that we can deliver better value for our shareholders with this approach.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Driscoll (Analysts)】\nBut is there any way to kind of put a sort of guideline to this margin expansion? I mean, I'm trying to get a sense of just is this 10, 20 basis points a year. Or is this something that has bigger potential than that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Anthony DiSilvestro (Executives)】\nI would say -- I mean, put it this way. I think there's an opportunity over time to grow the profit in that division above the company target.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Denise Morrison (Executives)】\nYes. And it has been eroded for the past couple of years. So by the -- getting into our cost structure and getting into the discipline of zero-based budgeting, we're going to be able to do this in a very surgical way so that it sticks and is sustainable.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Diane Geissler (Analysts)】\nI wanted to ask about the soup category. So we're heading into the start of the soup season here. It seems just anecdotally the category is a little promotional. I'm sure it's probably promotional every fall because it is the high season. Could you talk a little bit about what you're seeing on shelves and from the retailers in terms of the levels of support they're looking for? And is there any divergence from what you've seen around this time kind of every year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Denise Morrison (Executives)】\nYes. It's early days in the season. Right now, what we're focused on is making sure that our shelf space is intact and the products are merchandised correctly on shelf. We have new products that are being cut in like the K-Cups and organic soup, making sure that, that's sufficiently placed. Our Campbell sales team is working with customers on a robust promotion schedule, and -- but pretty consistent with what we've had in prior years. So at this point in time, I don't see anything unusual. I don't know, Anthony, if you have anything to add.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Anthony DiSilvestro (Executives)】\nNo, none, Denise.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Diane Geissler (Analysts)】\nNo?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Diane Geissler (Analysts)】\nAnd the K-Cups, how will you account for those? Are those -- what do you consider those? Condensed or ready-to-serve?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Denise Morrison (Executives)】\nWe actually believe they'll be largely incremental to the category because it is an incremental usage occasion, going after soup as a snack. We believe that there's a great overlap between our Campbell Soup users and Keurig users, and our research has confirmed that. We are shelving it in the coffee aisle in about 70% of the retail environment, and that's basically because we believe that people who are interested in buying K-Cups will see this as a real positive in terms of expanding the usage of their dispensers into new categories and new usage occasions. And we have 2 pack sizes, 1 designed to drive trial, which we're situating in the soup aisle, and then the -- and that's a 2-count pack; and then a 6-count pack in the coffee aisle. So we -- we're pretty excited about it. It's going to be different, but we believe that the space has really been a game changer for coffee and we expect some good things from it.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Anthony DiSilvestro (Executives)】\nAnd the segment classification -- it's a good question, and I'd have to think about that. And what we'll do is when we get to the first quarter, I'll make sure I highlight which segment we put that in.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Diane Geissler (Analysts)】\nOkay. And how many flavors are in the K-Cup?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Anthony DiSilvestro (Executives)】\nI think right now it's just 2.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Denise Morrison (Executives)】\nYes, 2.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ken Gosnell (Executives)】\nThank you, everyone, for joining our fourth quarter call and webcast.

Participating on today's call will be our CEO, Bob Sasser; our CFO, Kevin Wampler; and Family Dollar's President and Chief Operating Officer, Gary Philbin. \r\nBefore we begin, I would like to remind everyone that various remarks that we will make about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the safe harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors included in our most recent press release, most recent current report on Form 8-K, quarterly report on Form 10-Q and annual report on Form 10-K, which are all on file with the SEC. We have no obligation to update our forward-looking statements, and you should not expect us to do so. Unless otherwise noted, all margin, net income and earnings comparisons presented today exclude the impact of the Family Dollar Stores acquisition and integration-related costs for the second quarter and year-to-date. At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to your questions. [Operator Instructions] \r\nNow I will turn the call over to Bob Sasser, Dollar Tree's Chief Executive Officer.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Randy. Good morning, everyone. This morning, we announced results for the second quarter of fiscal 2015. With the closing of the Family Dollar transition -- transaction on July 6, this is our first sales and earnings report for the combined companies. This report includes 1 month of Family Dollar sales and operations combined with a full quarter of Dollar Tree performance. All Family Dollar stores are reported as new stores. \r\nIn the Dollar Tree segment of our business, same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 2.7%. This is on top of a 4.5% increase in second quarter of last year. Sales growth was driven by increases in both traffic and average ticket, with traffic increasing the most. Adjusted for the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations, the same-store sales increase was 2.4%. \r\nTotal sales at Dollar Tree stores for the second quarter grew 8.3% to $2.2 billion. This was at the midpoint of our previously announced guidance of $2.17 billion to $2.23 billion. Adjusted operating income increased by $22.4 million or 10.5% to $234.9 million, and adjusted operating margin for the quarter improved 20 basis points to 10.7% compared to 10.5% from the prior year second quarter. Adjusted net income for the Dollar Tree segment increased 10.1% to $138.9 million, and adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 9.8% to $0.67 compared with second quarter 2014 adjusted earnings of $0.61 per diluted share. This was near the top end of our previously announced guidance of $0.63 to $0.68 per diluted share. \r\nI'm extremely pleased with the consistent growth and strength of the Dollar Tree business. This was our 30th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales. Second quarter results continue to validate the relevance of the Dollar Tree brand. Customers are shopping with us more often. We're attracting new customers every day. And when the customers are in the store, they're buying more. Both traffic and average ticket increased for the quarter. \r\nDollar Tree continues to be part of the solution for millions of consumers as they strive to balance their household budgets. We serve a very loyal and growing customer base. Our commitment is to continue serving our existing customers better while taking every opportunity to gain new customers in every store every day. Our merchants do a great job sourcing product that exceeds customer expectations for what $1 can buy at a cost that fits our margin requirements. And our store teams are focused on providing a clean, full, fun and friendly shopping experience. Our merchandise values are better than ever, and our operating margin continues to lead the discount retail sector. \r\nSeasonal energy was high in May beginning with Mother's Day. In addition to party essentials, our stores were well stocked with cards, gifts, gift bags, balloons and candy for mom. Seasonal sell-through was good, and stores quickly and efficiently transitioned to patriotic themes and celebrations surrounding Memorial Day: picnics, pools, beaches and Summer Fun. Reflecting the seasonal strength of Mother's Day and Memorial Day, May was the strongest month for comp store sales in the quarter. For the full quarter, same-store sales increased as the result of growth in both basic consumables and discretionary products. Top-performing categories include candy and food, party, snacks and beverage and household supplies. \r\nGeographically, Dollar Tree same-store sales growth was the strongest in the Southwest followed by the Midwest, Southeast, Northeast and West Coast. All 5 geographic zones produced positive same-store sales in the quarter. We continue to invest in our customers by offering unbelievable values on many name brands and Bonus Buys, especially in our food, snack, beverage and household supplies. \r\nAnd not to forget the basics. Throughout the quarter, we continue to highlight our million-dollar brands with signage and special displays of those everyday items that provide terrific value to our customers. \r\nLooking forward, the Dollar Tree segment is positioned for increased relevance to our customers, sustained growth and improved profitability. We have multiple opportunities to continue growing and improving our business through opening more stores and increasing the productivity of all of our stores. \r\nIn the second quarter, we opened a total of 130 new stores and relocated or expanded 27 stores for a total of 157 projects. The new stores included 121 U.S. Dollar Tree stores, 3 Dollar Tree Canada stores and 2 Deals stores. Additionally, on August 1, we hosted grand openings at the first 4 of our rebannered Family Dollar to Dollar Tree stores. Total Dollar Tree square footage increased 7.8%. We ended the quarter with 5,583 stores, and we're on track with our plan for fiscal 2015, which includes 400 new stores, 75 relocations and expansions for a total of 475 projects across the U.S. and Canada. \r\nIn addition to new stores, we continue to execute our strategy to improve the productivity of our existing stores. Some of our drive-the-business initiatives include: category expansions, where customers are realizing more value as we rationalize and expand assortments in pet supplies, hardware, health care, beauty and eyewear as well as home and household products; seasonal relevance, our storefronts change with the seasons. At Dollar Tree, we want to own the seasons at the $1 price point. Merchandise energy and the thrill of the hunt throughout the store. At Dollar Tree, you'll always find an unexpected value. And being first-of-the-month ready, we place special emphasis on basic, consumable core items at the beginning of each month when many customers are shopping for basic needs. \r\nAdditionally, we're continuing the expansion of our frozen and refrigerated category. In the second quarter, we installed freezers and coolers in 159 additional stores for a total of 255 additional stores year-to-date. We currently offer frozen and refrigerated products in 3,875 stores, and we continue to grow. Frozen and refrigerated merchandise is generally lower margin, but it's faster turning, more frequently purchased and the increase in shopping frequency provides Dollar Tree the opportunity to drive incremental sales across all categories, including our higher-margin discretionary product. Most importantly, the product serves the needs of our customer. \r\nWe continue to support planned growth by building infrastructure and distribution capacity ahead of the need. We recently began construction of Dollar Tree DC #11, a 1.5 million square-foot, automated facility in Cherokee County, South Carolina. This facility will provide capacity and increased efficiency to support continued profitable store growth in the Southeastern and Mid-Atlantic U.S. We plan to have the facility operational in third quarter of 2016. \r\nI'm extremely pleased with our company's accomplishments in second quarter. Our Dollar Tree business continues to deliver operating margins that lead the value retail sector. Our customer base is large and growing. Both traffic and average ticket increased in second quarter. We have an experienced and talented merchandising team that continues to do a tremendous job of finding and delivering terrific values to our customers with margins that meet our thresholds. In second quarter, merchandise margin increased over the prior year. We announced and began construction on Dollar Tree DC 11, and we completed the acquisition of Family Dollar, immediately transitioning from integration planning to integration execution of the 2 companies. We have an incredible opportunity ahead of us as a combined organization. I am more enthusiastic than ever about the opportunity this merger presents for our customers, our suppliers, our associates and our shareholders. With the successful completion of the acquisition of Family Dollar on July 6, we are now a much larger and more diverse organization, able to benefit from scale and deliver even greater values. With more than 13,800 stores across North America, supported by a solid and scalable infrastructure, this combination provides the unique opportunity to leverage our multiple banners to better serve a broader range of customers while enhancing our ability to deliver long-term profitable growth for our shareholders. \r\nWe have great confidence in our ability to deliver at least $300 million in annual run rate synergies by the end of the third year post-closing. These synergies will be driven through 4 primary avenues: sourcing and procurement; our rebanner program for optimizing store formats; distribution and logistics; and fourth, overhead and corporate SG&A. As previously stated, we expect to spend approximately $300 million in onetime costs to achieve these synergies. \r\nOur priority areas of focus for Family Dollar will be on, first of all, the customer, we will be evolving the merchandise assortments to increase value and better meet their needs; the customer experience, creating a more exciting, inviting and customer-friendly shopping environment; lowering field management turnover; supporting our store initiatives and developing a more performance-based culture throughout the company and increasing store productivity. We will be modifying assortments to improve sales and inventory productivity in existing stores while improving new store remodel and expansion performance. \r\nOur 100-day action plan includes 7 key initiatives. First of all, communicating organizational leadership changes and establishing management cadence and coordination. As planned, effective on day 1, Gary Philbin, my business partner for the past 15 years, took over as President and Chief Operating Officer at Family Dollar, and Mike Witynski was promoted to the role of Chief Operating Officer at Dollar Tree. Immediately, we began standing up workgroups and establishing a weekly and monthly cadence of cross-banner meetings. We began defining coordinated merchandise planning and buying across banners. We are consolidating reporting and financial management tools. We've created a stub-year plan to align the Family Dollar calendar with the Dollar Tree retail calendar by the end of the year. We're developing a combined real estate review and approval process. Our goal is to put the right banner in the right location to best serve the customer and to ensure we're using an appropriate pro forma analysis with appropriate hurdle rates for profitability. We are completing our compensation and organization leveling review, bringing both organizations to a common title hierarchy with a common compensation and benefit plan and a common calendar. \r\nSecond, we immediately kicked off plans and processes to capture sourcing and procurement synergies. One of our largest synergy opportunities is using our size, scale and efficiency to buy better. We currently spend about $10 billion on items for resale and another $3 billion for products and services we buy for use in the business. Immediately following closing, our merchandising teams met to share detailed cost information to identify and quantify specific opportunities and to develop a strategic action plan to obtain the best cost in both banners. \r\nThe \"cost of goods sold\" initiative is focused in 3 primary areas. The first area is aligning exact match products carried by both companies and obtaining the lowest cost for both banners. Second is a review of similar match products. Here, our merchants are aligning specifications and combining purchasing power to reduce cost. Third is payment term parity, which will benefit the combined company with savings from harmonizing payment terms. The plans have been developed. The initiative has launched and we're well on our way to achieving our goals of reducing cost of goods sold. \r\nAdditionally, our procurement teams are addressing our indirect spend. These are items and services that we buy that are used in the business. The opportunity to use our size and efficiency to reduce cost is significant. These items and services have been grouped into waves to be addressed over time through a blend of negotiations, options, RFPs and formal bid processes. This process has also begun, and we're on track to achieve our first 100-day goals. \r\nThird, we have officially kicked of our store rebanner process. We are very excited about the opportunity to rebanner store locations to better serve our customers while improving the overall productivity of these individual stores. Our initial focus will be transforming hundreds of underperforming Family Dollar stores into Dollar Tree stores. Using the Dollar Tree real estate model, we're reviewing underperforming Family Dollar stores to determine if they would perform more profitably as Dollar Tree stores. \r\nUpon closing, we immediately began the process to rebanner 4 test stores. The test was to validate that we had all the necessary steps in place to facilitate a smooth conversion. The individual stores close for approximately 2 weeks as we liquidate the Family Dollar merchandise, convert the decor, signing and fixtures, train the store teams and bring in the Dollar Tree inventory. These first 4 test stores reopened on August 1, less than 4 weeks following the completion of the acquisition. While very early in the process, these stores experienced successful grand openings as Dollar Tree stores. We have since rebannered and opened 39 more for a total of 43 stores as of last Friday, August 28, with similar grand opening results. Going forward, we've developed a list of stores to be rebannered each week through the end of October, and assuming continued success, we will reengage these efforts in 2016. By the end of October, we expect to have more than 150 stores converted. We're very pleased with the process and with the early results. Feedback from customers in these markets has been positive. \r\nFourth, in the first 100 days, we plan to establish cross-organizational IT access and finalize our initial technology integration strategy. Both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar have very good technology platforms, and there are no significant gaps or immediate needs. Through our integration planning, we've developed a road map to strategically combine our technology over time. The timing of these changes will be driven by the size of achievable synergies versus the expected cost. \r\nOur current plan or road map includes 4 primary phases. Immediately in Phase 1, we're addressing back-office system consolidations. Phase 2 addresses system alignment related to transportation, workforce and HR support and business intelligence. Phase 3 addresses consolidation of core merchandising systems, including forecasting and replenishment. And Phase 4 addresses projects related to distribution center management, point-of-sale and real estate. \r\nFifth, we're developing and initiating plans to better serve the Family Dollar customer and to build sales momentum. Raising the table stakes is a key priority and a significant opportunity in our integration efforts. Our first 100-day plans include clearing aged and nonproductive inventory while improving our in-stock position on everyday basics. This includes reclaiming prime space for impactful displays for our fourth quarter seasonal and promotional assortment and continuing the analysis of productivity by category. \r\nSixth, we will be finalizing the supply chain road map and initiating the multi-banner supply chain project. Working with a cross-banner functional team and third-party supply chain consultants, we're developing plans for integrating our warehouse management systems and making plans to rationalize the fleet of combined DCs, analyzing our space need by banner and determining our ability to ship both banners out of each facility. This is a very large product -- project with a very significant opportunity for long-term synergies. \r\nSeventh, we're further developing and initiating plans to reduce costs with a shared services model. Over time, we will be combining our efforts to support both banners with a shared service organization in human resources, finance, information technology, logistics, legal, strategy and audit. Our goal is to provide consistent, efficient support of our business initiatives across the combined organization while reducing costs. \r\nThis is a high-level overview of some of the components of our 100-day action plan. There are some quick and easy wins here and some that will take a great deal of work. The timing of some will be dependent on our IT integration. Our strategy is not to touch everything at once but to prioritize our areas of focus to get it right the first time and build the overall business for the long term. It is a process. It will take time, but the size of the prize is worth it. \r\nNow I'll turn the call over to Kevin to provide more detail on our financial metrics and our outlook for 2015.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Bob, and good morning. As Bob mentioned, we were pleased with our overall performance for the second quarter. The Dollar Tree segment performed well within the range of guidance that we provided. As a result of the acquisition, year-over-year comparisons for the next 4 quarters will be more complex than normal since there's no prior year data for the Family Dollar segment. \r\nTotal sales for the second quarter grew 48.3% to $3.01 billion, which includes 4 weeks of Family Dollar sales. Excluding the $812 million in Family Dollar sales, the Dollar Tree segment sales increased 8.3%. Same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 2.7% versus a strong 4.5% in the prior year second quarter. The increase was driven by both traffic and ticket. Adjusted for the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations, same-store sales grew 2.4%. Please note that all of the recently acquired Family Dollar stores and newly rebannered stores are considered new stores and are not included in our same-store sales calculation. \r\nGross profit for the combined organization increased by $161.1 million or 23.2% to $855.2 million for the second quarter of 2015 compared to last year's quarter. The majority of the dollar increase was driven by Family Dollar's gross profit of $105.9 million. A few factors to note are, as a result of the purchase price allocation for the acquisition, a preliminary purchase accounting adjustment of $116.3 million was recorded for the step up in basis of Family Dollar inventory to its fair value. Of this amount, $55 million is amortizable, of which $11.1 million was amortized during the second quarter to cost of goods sold and negatively impacted gross margin results. We expect an additional $38.1 million will be amortized to cost of goods sold over the remaining 6 months of 2015. \r\nDuring the second quarter, we also took a $60 million markdown reserve for SKU rationalization and planned liquidations related to Family Dollar inventory that will not be carried going forward. Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment was 34.1% during the second quarter compared with 34.2% in the prior year second quarter. The 10 basis point decline as a percent of sales was driven by higher shrink in occupancy costs, partially offset by improved merchandise costs. \r\nSelling, general and administrative expenses in the quarter for the combined organization increased 49.7% to $731.8 million from $489 million in last year's second quarter. The majority of the $242.7 million increase related to $200.9 million of Family Dollar expense, which included $6.5 million for the amortization of favorable lease rights recorded in connection with the acquisition and $6.5 million of additional depreciation for the harmonization of the combined company policies. For the second quarter, we incurred $17.7 million or 55 basis points of expenses related to the Family Dollar acquisition compared to $7.5 million or 35 basis points of acquisition expenses in the second quarter of 2014. \r\nAs a percent of sales, SG&A expenses increased 20 basis points to 24.3% in the second quarter from 24.1% in the same quarter last year. Excluding acquisition costs, SG&A expense as a percent of sales was consistent with the prior year at 23.7%. Adjusted SG&A expense for the Dollar Tree segment was $514.4 million or 23.4% of sales. As a percent of sales, this represented a 30 basis point improvement compared to the second quarter of 2014 adjusted SG&A expense for the Dollar Tree segment of 23.7%. The decrease was driven by improved store labor productivity, lower incentive comp and lower legal fees as a percent of sales. Operating income for the combined organization decreased to $123.4 million compared with $205 million in the same period last year. This decrease is a result of lower gross profit margin and higher SG&A expenses, as previously mentioned. \r\nAdjusted operating income for the Dollar Tree segment increased $22.4 million to $234.9 million or 10.7% of sales compared to 10.5% of sales in the prior year second quarter. Nonoperating expenses for the second quarter totaled $265.6 million and were comprised of the following: a $1.7 million expense due to an unfavorable fair market value adjustment on diesel fuel swaps; a net interest expense of $263.9 million in the quarter compared to $8.4 million in the prior year second quarter. This increase included interest on the long-term debt for the acquisition, an $89.5 million breakage fee related to the prepayment of the Dollar Tree senior notes and a $39.5 million prepayment fee related to the Term Loan B refinancing; a $17.4 million write-off of original issue discount; and a $5.9 million write-off of deferred financing cost related to the Term Loan B refinancing. The quarterly run rate for interest expense going forward will be approximately $100 million, including deferred financing cost amortization. \r\nFor the second quarter, the company had a net loss of $98 million or $0.46 per diluted share. Excluding acquisition-related adjustments, the company had net income of $53.5 million or $0.25 per diluted share. \r\nAdjusted net income for the Dollar Tree segment was $138.9 million or $0.67 per adjusted diluted share, a 9.8% increase when compared to the reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.61 per diluted share in the prior year second quarter. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was a benefit of 31.1% compared to an expense of 38.2% in the prior year quarter. The decrease was primarily the result of the pretax income loss in the second -- in the quarter and the nondeductible acquisition costs. \r\nLooking at the balance sheet and statement of cash flow. Combined cash and cash equivalents at quarter end totaled $1.3 billion compared to $467.7 million at the end of the second quarter of 2014. Inventory for the Dollar Tree segment at quarter-end was 6.7% greater than at the same time last year, while selling square footage increased 7.8%. Consolidated inventory per selling square foot decreased 1%. We believe that current inventory levels are appropriate to support scheduled new store openings and our sales initiatives for the third quarter. Consolidated capital expenditures were $100.1 million in the second quarter of 2015 versus $88.3 million in the second quarter of last year. \r\nFor the full year 2015, we're planning for consolidated capital expenditures to range from $600 million to $615 million. Capital expenditures will be focused on new stores and remodels, including additional few development stores; rebanner of select Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree stores; the addition of frozen and refrigerated capability to approximately 425 Dollar Tree stores, up from the previous expectation of 320; IT system enhancements; and the construction of our new Cherokee County, South Carolina distribution center. \r\nDepreciation and amortization totaled $89.5 million for the second quarter versus $49.9 million in the second quarter last year. For 2015, we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to range from $470 million to $490 million. This range includes increases over the traditional run rate of depreciation and amortization expense for Family Dollar for 2 items. First, it includes $46 million of depreciation above the historical run rate for Family Dollar as a result of harmonizing the depreciable lines accounting policies of the 2 companies and the increase in the value of assets based on the purchase price allocation. Secondly, it includes $45 million for the amortization of favorable lease rights for the purchase price valuation of Family Dollar leases. \r\nFor the third quarter, we are forecasting total sales to range from $4.78 billion to $4.87 billion. For the full year of 2015, we are now estimating total sales will range from $15.3 billion to $15.52 billion. Both of these estimates are based on low single-digit same-store sales increase. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 235.7 million shares for Q3 and 223.5 million shares for the full year. \r\nOur expectations for the Dollar Tree segment of our business in the back half have not materially changed from our original expectation as we entered the year. However, as a result of the recently completed acquisition, the significant integration initiatives and the divestiture process, we are not providing earnings per share guidance for the third quarter or full year at this time. \r\nI would like to reiterate that our same-store sales calculation excludes recently acquired Family Dollar stores and excludes stores that are rebannered from Family Dollar to Dollar Tree. We will experience some degree of cannibalization to Dollar Tree comps as part of our rebanner efforts. This cannibalization expectation was planned and factored into both our rebanner strategy analysis and our outlook for same-store sales in the back half of 2015. \r\nI would like to briefly speak to the divestiture process. Related to our acquisition, we reached an agreement to divest 330 Family Dollar stores to Sycamore Partners to satisfy the Federal Trade Commission's divestiture requirements. These 330 stores represent approximately $45.5 million in annual operating income. We're on schedule to close on the divestiture sale later this year. The closing of the divestiture transaction will not change our future net assets because the net effect of the divestiture on Dollar Tree's assets and liabilities are reflected in the consolidated balance sheet in our Form 10-Q being filed today. The divestiture will have 2 effects on our future income: in addition to losing the operating income associated with these 330 stores, we also expect to incur $5 million to $10 million in transaction closing costs and setup costs related to transition services. Over a period expected to be no more than 24 months, we will be providing certain support and transition services and expect to be reimbursed by the buyer for these direct operating costs and support services. \r\nI will now turn the call back over to Bob.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Kevin. It's an exciting time for Dollar Tree. The strategic rationale for the Family Dollar acquisition is more compelling than ever. This is an extremely large and complex transaction involving more than 13,000 retail store locations and 23 distribution centers, the largest of any previous retail merger, and it will take some time. It is early in the integration process, and I'm more enthusiastic than ever about the long-term opportunity to provide substantially increased shareholder value. \r\nWe have great confidence in our opportunity and ability to achieve at least $300 million in annual run rate synergies by the end of year 3. These synergies will be achieved through a combination of lowering costs in both direct and indirect sourcing, banner optimization, logistics and overhead. We will employ a disciplined approach to driving key strategic initiatives to the combined organization through improved communication, analysis, collaboration and incentives. We're confident that in placing our initial emphasis in these areas, we can materially enhance operating performance of the Family Dollar brand through improvements in sales, margin, expense control and greater customer satisfaction. \r\nBefore we go to Q&A, I'd like to introduce Gary Philbin to our call. Effective immediately upon closing, Gary took over as President and Chief Operating Officer at Family Dollar. This is a key role that had been vacant for about 18 months, and the organization was in need of direction and leadership following the lengthy acquisition process. Many of you already know Gary. We've worked together, improving and growing the Dollar Tree business for the past 15 years, and I have tremendous confidence in his ability as a retailer and as a leader. Gary?\n\n---\n\nThank you, Bob, and good morning, everyone. First, let me say we are only 8 weeks into the integration, and we are enthusiastic about the initial progress and this incredible opportunity ahead of us. I'm pleased with the dedication and focus of the entire Family Dollar team. As you know, Family Dollar's a well-established brand that has been successful for more than 50 years. I think our FD, Family Dollar business, is not broken. We simply need to roll up our sleeves, focus on what's important, and we have work to do to polish up this well-known brand. \r\nBob provided a high-level strategic overview of our 100-day action plan. I would like to provide greater detail into the execution components and our areas of focus on improving the Family Dollar's customer shopping experience. \r\nOur goal is to consistently provide great value, affordable prices and relevant items in a store environment that is convenient, clean, reliable and productive. To accomplish this goal, we're going to build on 4 basic fundamentals: great product value, well-run stores, smart choices for our customers and consistency of in-stocks on everyday items. Nothing I said here is new to retail. This is really Retail 101. We are focused on consistent execution, combined with a relentless focus on our customer. It's important to understand that we will be making investments to improve what we refer to table stakes, and these investments will include delivering on the consistency of a clean-store benchmark, catching up on deferred maintenance, investing in the right amount of payroll to drive both productivity and enhance the customer experience and improving the overall efficiency of our in-store processes. \r\nImportantly, we are kicking off a process to clear non-go-forward merchandise in the stores. So you're likely to see clearance activity over the next couple of months as we gear up for having our shelves stocked with basic, everyday items and to show off our great seasonal product. This will have an impact on margins near term, but it's absolutely the right thing to do for our business in the long term. \r\nBefore I turn the call back over to Bob, I just want to say again, I'm proud to be part of the Family Dollar team. I am pleased with the work being done, and I'm excited about the opportunities this will present, both for our vendor community and our Family Dollar team members as we improve and grow the Family Dollar brand. \r\nNow let me turn it back over to Bob.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Gary. I want to close the prepared remarks by saying that the Dollar Tree business model is powerful, flexible and more relevant than ever, providing extreme value to customers while recording record levels of earnings. Our model has been tested by time and validated by history. For 30 consecutive quarters, Dollar Tree has delivered positive same-store sales increases. Through good times and difficult times in all retail cycles, consumers are looking for value no matter the state of the economy. While our price point remains $1, our operating margin continues to lead the discount sector. \r\nWith the addition of Family Dollar, we're a larger, stronger and more diversified business, better able to serve more customers and more markets with exactly what they're looking for: great value in every store every day. And we have many years of growth ahead of us. Over the past 3 weeks, I've had the privilege to attend and present at both Family Dollar's Annual Leadership Conference and Dollar Tree's annual field management meeting. I could not be more proud of our combined organizations. Our field management and our leadership teams are talented, experienced, energized and incredibly motivated. \r\nOperator, we are now ready for questions.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Randy Guiler (Executives)】\nThank you, Rochelle. Good morning, and welcome to our conference call to discuss Dollar Tree's performance for the second quarter of fiscal 2015. Participating on today's call will be our CEO, Bob Sasser; our CFO, Kevin Wampler; and Family Dollar's President and Chief Operating Officer, Gary Philbin. \r\nBefore we begin, I would like to remind everyone that various remarks that we will make about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the safe harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors included in our most recent press release, most recent current report on Form 8-K, quarterly report on Form 10-Q and annual report on Form 10-K, which are all on file with the SEC. We have no obligation to update our forward-looking statements, and you should not expect us to do so. Unless otherwise noted, all margin, net income and earnings comparisons presented today exclude the impact of the Family Dollar Stores acquisition and integration-related costs for the second quarter and year-to-date. At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to your questions. [Operator Instructions] \r\nNow I will turn the call over to Bob Sasser, Dollar Tree's Chief Executive Officer.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Bob Sasser (Executives)】\nThanks, Randy. Good morning, everyone. This morning, we announced results for the second quarter of fiscal 2015. With the closing of the Family Dollar transition -- transaction on July 6, this is our first sales and earnings report for the combined companies. This report includes 1 month of Family Dollar sales and operations combined with a full quarter of Dollar Tree performance. All Family Dollar stores are reported as new stores. \r\nIn the Dollar Tree segment of our business, same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 2.7%. This is on top of a 4.5% increase in second quarter of last year. Sales growth was driven by increases in both traffic and average ticket, with traffic increasing the most. Adjusted for the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations, the same-store sales increase was 2.4%. \r\nTotal sales at Dollar Tree stores for the second quarter grew 8.3% to $2.2 billion. This was at the midpoint of our previously announced guidance of $2.17 billion to $2.23 billion. Adjusted operating income increased by $22.4 million or 10.5% to $234.9 million, and adjusted operating margin for the quarter improved 20 basis points to 10.7% compared to 10.5% from the prior year second quarter. Adjusted net income for the Dollar Tree segment increased 10.1% to $138.9 million, and adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 9.8% to $0.67 compared with second quarter 2014 adjusted earnings of $0.61 per diluted share. This was near the top end of our previously announced guidance of $0.63 to $0.68 per diluted share. \r\nI'm extremely pleased with the consistent growth and strength of the Dollar Tree business. This was our 30th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales. Second quarter results continue to validate the relevance of the Dollar Tree brand. Customers are shopping with us more often. We're attracting new customers every day. And when the customers are in the store, they're buying more. Both traffic and average ticket increased for the quarter. \r\nDollar Tree continues to be part of the solution for millions of consumers as they strive to balance their household budgets. We serve a very loyal and growing customer base. Our commitment is to continue serving our existing customers better while taking every opportunity to gain new customers in every store every day. Our merchants do a great job sourcing product that exceeds customer expectations for what $1 can buy at a cost that fits our margin requirements. And our store teams are focused on providing a clean, full, fun and friendly shopping experience. Our merchandise values are better than ever, and our operating margin continues to lead the discount retail sector. \r\nSeasonal energy was high in May beginning with Mother's Day. In addition to party essentials, our stores were well stocked with cards, gifts, gift bags, balloons and candy for mom. Seasonal sell-through was good, and stores quickly and efficiently transitioned to patriotic themes and celebrations surrounding Memorial Day: picnics, pools, beaches and Summer Fun. Reflecting the seasonal strength of Mother's Day and Memorial Day, May was the strongest month for comp store sales in the quarter. For the full quarter, same-store sales increased as the result of growth in both basic consumables and discretionary products. Top-performing categories include candy and food, party, snacks and beverage and household supplies. \r\nGeographically, Dollar Tree same-store sales growth was the strongest in the Southwest followed by the Midwest, Southeast, Northeast and West Coast. All 5 geographic zones produced positive same-store sales in the quarter. We continue to invest in our customers by offering unbelievable values on many name brands and Bonus Buys, especially in our food, snack, beverage and household supplies. \r\nAnd not to forget the basics. Throughout the quarter, we continue to highlight our million-dollar brands with signage and special displays of those everyday items that provide terrific value to our customers. \r\nLooking forward, the Dollar Tree segment is positioned for increased relevance to our customers, sustained growth and improved profitability. We have multiple opportunities to continue growing and improving our business through opening more stores and increasing the productivity of all of our stores. \r\nIn the second quarter, we opened a total of 130 new stores and relocated or expanded 27 stores for a total of 157 projects. The new stores included 121 U.S. Dollar Tree stores, 3 Dollar Tree Canada stores and 2 Deals stores. Additionally, on August 1, we hosted grand openings at the first 4 of our rebannered Family Dollar to Dollar Tree stores. Total Dollar Tree square footage increased 7.8%. We ended the quarter with 5,583 stores, and we're on track with our plan for fiscal 2015, which includes 400 new stores, 75 relocations and expansions for a total of 475 projects across the U.S. and Canada. \r\nIn addition to new stores, we continue to execute our strategy to improve the productivity of our existing stores. Some of our drive-the-business initiatives include: category expansions, where customers are realizing more value as we rationalize and expand assortments in pet supplies, hardware, health care, beauty and eyewear as well as home and household products; seasonal relevance, our storefronts change with the seasons. At Dollar Tree, we want to own the seasons at the $1 price point. Merchandise energy and the thrill of the hunt throughout the store. At Dollar Tree, you'll always find an unexpected value. And being first-of-the-month ready, we place special emphasis on basic, consumable core items at the beginning of each month when many customers are shopping for basic needs. \r\nAdditionally, we're continuing the expansion of our frozen and refrigerated category. In the second quarter, we installed freezers and coolers in 159 additional stores for a total of 255 additional stores year-to-date. We currently offer frozen and refrigerated products in 3,875 stores, and we continue to grow. Frozen and refrigerated merchandise is generally lower margin, but it's faster turning, more frequently purchased and the increase in shopping frequency provides Dollar Tree the opportunity to drive incremental sales across all categories, including our higher-margin discretionary product. Most importantly, the product serves the needs of our customer. \r\nWe continue to support planned growth by building infrastructure and distribution capacity ahead of the need. We recently began construction of Dollar Tree DC #11, a 1.5 million square-foot, automated facility in Cherokee County, South Carolina. This facility will provide capacity and increased efficiency to support continued profitable store growth in the Southeastern and Mid-Atlantic U.S. We plan to have the facility operational in third quarter of 2016. \r\nI'm extremely pleased with our company's accomplishments in second quarter. Our Dollar Tree business continues to deliver operating margins that lead the value retail sector. Our customer base is large and growing. Both traffic and average ticket increased in second quarter. We have an experienced and talented merchandising team that continues to do a tremendous job of finding and delivering terrific values to our customers with margins that meet our thresholds. In second quarter, merchandise margin increased over the prior year. We announced and began construction on Dollar Tree DC 11, and we completed the acquisition of Family Dollar, immediately transitioning from integration planning to integration execution of the 2 companies. We have an incredible opportunity ahead of us as a combined organization. I am more enthusiastic than ever about the opportunity this merger presents for our customers, our suppliers, our associates and our shareholders. With the successful completion of the acquisition of Family Dollar on July 6, we are now a much larger and more diverse organization, able to benefit from scale and deliver even greater values. With more than 13,800 stores across North America, supported by a solid and scalable infrastructure, this combination provides the unique opportunity to leverage our multiple banners to better serve a broader range of customers while enhancing our ability to deliver long-term profitable growth for our shareholders. \r\nWe have great confidence in our ability to deliver at least $300 million in annual run rate synergies by the end of the third year post-closing. These synergies will be driven through 4 primary avenues: sourcing and procurement; our rebanner program for optimizing store formats; distribution and logistics; and fourth, overhead and corporate SG&A. As previously stated, we expect to spend approximately $300 million in onetime costs to achieve these synergies. \r\nOur priority areas of focus for Family Dollar will be on, first of all, the customer, we will be evolving the merchandise assortments to increase value and better meet their needs; the customer experience, creating a more exciting, inviting and customer-friendly shopping environment; lowering field management turnover; supporting our store initiatives and developing a more performance-based culture throughout the company and increasing store productivity. We will be modifying assortments to improve sales and inventory productivity in existing stores while improving new store remodel and expansion performance. \r\nOur 100-day action plan includes 7 key initiatives. First of all, communicating organizational leadership changes and establishing management cadence and coordination. As planned, effective on day 1, Gary Philbin, my business partner for the past 15 years, took over as President and Chief Operating Officer at Family Dollar, and Mike Witynski was promoted to the role of Chief Operating Officer at Dollar Tree. Immediately, we began standing up workgroups and establishing a weekly and monthly cadence of cross-banner meetings. We began defining coordinated merchandise planning and buying across banners. We are consolidating reporting and financial management tools. We've created a stub-year plan to align the Family Dollar calendar with the Dollar Tree retail calendar by the end of the year. We're developing a combined real estate review and approval process. Our goal is to put the right banner in the right location to best serve the customer and to ensure we're using an appropriate pro forma analysis with appropriate hurdle rates for profitability. We are completing our compensation and organization leveling review, bringing both organizations to a common title hierarchy with a common compensation and benefit plan and a common calendar. \r\nSecond, we immediately kicked off plans and processes to capture sourcing and procurement synergies. One of our largest synergy opportunities is using our size, scale and efficiency to buy better. We currently spend about $10 billion on items for resale and another $3 billion for products and services we buy for use in the business. Immediately following closing, our merchandising teams met to share detailed cost information to identify and quantify specific opportunities and to develop a strategic action plan to obtain the best cost in both banners. \r\nThe \"cost of goods sold\" initiative is focused in 3 primary areas. The first area is aligning exact match products carried by both companies and obtaining the lowest cost for both banners. Second is a review of similar match products. Here, our merchants are aligning specifications and combining purchasing power to reduce cost. Third is payment term parity, which will benefit the combined company with savings from harmonizing payment terms. The plans have been developed. The initiative has launched and we're well on our way to achieving our goals of reducing cost of goods sold. \r\nAdditionally, our procurement teams are addressing our indirect spend. These are items and services that we buy that are used in the business. The opportunity to use our size and efficiency to reduce cost is significant. These items and services have been grouped into waves to be addressed over time through a blend of negotiations, options, RFPs and formal bid processes. This process has also begun, and we're on track to achieve our first 100-day goals. \r\nThird, we have officially kicked of our store rebanner process. We are very excited about the opportunity to rebanner store locations to better serve our customers while improving the overall productivity of these individual stores. Our initial focus will be transforming hundreds of underperforming Family Dollar stores into Dollar Tree stores. Using the Dollar Tree real estate model, we're reviewing underperforming Family Dollar stores to determine if they would perform more profitably as Dollar Tree stores. \r\nUpon closing, we immediately began the process to rebanner 4 test stores. The test was to validate that we had all the necessary steps in place to facilitate a smooth conversion. The individual stores close for approximately 2 weeks as we liquidate the Family Dollar merchandise, convert the decor, signing and fixtures, train the store teams and bring in the Dollar Tree inventory. These first 4 test stores reopened on August 1, less than 4 weeks following the completion of the acquisition. While very early in the process, these stores experienced successful grand openings as Dollar Tree stores. We have since rebannered and opened 39 more for a total of 43 stores as of last Friday, August 28, with similar grand opening results. Going forward, we've developed a list of stores to be rebannered each week through the end of October, and assuming continued success, we will reengage these efforts in 2016. By the end of October, we expect to have more than 150 stores converted. We're very pleased with the process and with the early results. Feedback from customers in these markets has been positive. \r\nFourth, in the first 100 days, we plan to establish cross-organizational IT access and finalize our initial technology integration strategy. Both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar have very good technology platforms, and there are no significant gaps or immediate needs. Through our integration planning, we've developed a road map to strategically combine our technology over time. The timing of these changes will be driven by the size of achievable synergies versus the expected cost. \r\nOur current plan or road map includes 4 primary phases. Immediately in Phase 1, we're addressing back-office system consolidations. Phase 2 addresses system alignment related to transportation, workforce and HR support and business intelligence. Phase 3 addresses consolidation of core merchandising systems, including forecasting and replenishment. And Phase 4 addresses projects related to distribution center management, point-of-sale and real estate. \r\nFifth, we're developing and initiating plans to better serve the Family Dollar customer and to build sales momentum. Raising the table stakes is a key priority and a significant opportunity in our integration efforts. Our first 100-day plans include clearing aged and nonproductive inventory while improving our in-stock position on everyday basics. This includes reclaiming prime space for impactful displays for our fourth quarter seasonal and promotional assortment and continuing the analysis of productivity by category. \r\nSixth, we will be finalizing the supply chain road map and initiating the multi-banner supply chain project. Working with a cross-banner functional team and third-party supply chain consultants, we're developing plans for integrating our warehouse management systems and making plans to rationalize the fleet of combined DCs, analyzing our space need by banner and determining our ability to ship both banners out of each facility. This is a very large product -- project with a very significant opportunity for long-term synergies. \r\nSeventh, we're further developing and initiating plans to reduce costs with a shared services model. Over time, we will be combining our efforts to support both banners with a shared service organization in human resources, finance, information technology, logistics, legal, strategy and audit. Our goal is to provide consistent, efficient support of our business initiatives across the combined organization while reducing costs. \r\nThis is a high-level overview of some of the components of our 100-day action plan. There are some quick and easy wins here and some that will take a great deal of work. The timing of some will be dependent on our IT integration. Our strategy is not to touch everything at once but to prioritize our areas of focus to get it right the first time and build the overall business for the long term. It is a process. It will take time, but the size of the prize is worth it. \r\nNow I'll turn the call over to Kevin to provide more detail on our financial metrics and our outlook for 2015.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Kevin Wampler (Executives)】\nThanks, Bob, and good morning. As Bob mentioned, we were pleased with our overall performance for the second quarter. The Dollar Tree segment performed well within the range of guidance that we provided. As a result of the acquisition, year-over-year comparisons for the next 4 quarters will be more complex than normal since there's no prior year data for the Family Dollar segment. \r\nTotal sales for the second quarter grew 48.3% to $3.01 billion, which includes 4 weeks of Family Dollar sales. Excluding the $812 million in Family Dollar sales, the Dollar Tree segment sales increased 8.3%. Same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 2.7% versus a strong 4.5% in the prior year second quarter. The increase was driven by both traffic and ticket. Adjusted for the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations, same-store sales grew 2.4%. Please note that all of the recently acquired Family Dollar stores and newly rebannered stores are considered new stores and are not included in our same-store sales calculation. \r\nGross profit for the combined organization increased by $161.1 million or 23.2% to $855.2 million for the second quarter of 2015 compared to last year's quarter. The majority of the dollar increase was driven by Family Dollar's gross profit of $105.9 million. A few factors to note are, as a result of the purchase price allocation for the acquisition, a preliminary purchase accounting adjustment of $116.3 million was recorded for the step up in basis of Family Dollar inventory to its fair value. Of this amount, $55 million is amortizable, of which $11.1 million was amortized during the second quarter to cost of goods sold and negatively impacted gross margin results. We expect an additional $38.1 million will be amortized to cost of goods sold over the remaining 6 months of 2015. \r\nDuring the second quarter, we also took a $60 million markdown reserve for SKU rationalization and planned liquidations related to Family Dollar inventory that will not be carried going forward. Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment was 34.1% during the second quarter compared with 34.2% in the prior year second quarter. The 10 basis point decline as a percent of sales was driven by higher shrink in occupancy costs, partially offset by improved merchandise costs. \r\nSelling, general and administrative expenses in the quarter for the combined organization increased 49.7% to $731.8 million from $489 million in last year's second quarter. The majority of the $242.7 million increase related to $200.9 million of Family Dollar expense, which included $6.5 million for the amortization of favorable lease rights recorded in connection with the acquisition and $6.5 million of additional depreciation for the harmonization of the combined company policies. For the second quarter, we incurred $17.7 million or 55 basis points of expenses related to the Family Dollar acquisition compared to $7.5 million or 35 basis points of acquisition expenses in the second quarter of 2014. \r\nAs a percent of sales, SG&A expenses increased 20 basis points to 24.3% in the second quarter from 24.1% in the same quarter last year. Excluding acquisition costs, SG&A expense as a percent of sales was consistent with the prior year at 23.7%. Adjusted SG&A expense for the Dollar Tree segment was $514.4 million or 23.4% of sales. As a percent of sales, this represented a 30 basis point improvement compared to the second quarter of 2014 adjusted SG&A expense for the Dollar Tree segment of 23.7%. The decrease was driven by improved store labor productivity, lower incentive comp and lower legal fees as a percent of sales. Operating income for the combined organization decreased to $123.4 million compared with $205 million in the same period last year. This decrease is a result of lower gross profit margin and higher SG&A expenses, as previously mentioned. \r\nAdjusted operating income for the Dollar Tree segment increased $22.4 million to $234.9 million or 10.7% of sales compared to 10.5% of sales in the prior year second quarter. Nonoperating expenses for the second quarter totaled $265.6 million and were comprised of the following: a $1.7 million expense due to an unfavorable fair market value adjustment on diesel fuel swaps; a net interest expense of $263.9 million in the quarter compared to $8.4 million in the prior year second quarter. This increase included interest on the long-term debt for the acquisition, an $89.5 million breakage fee related to the prepayment of the Dollar Tree senior notes and a $39.5 million prepayment fee related to the Term Loan B refinancing; a $17.4 million write-off of original issue discount; and a $5.9 million write-off of deferred financing cost related to the Term Loan B refinancing. The quarterly run rate for interest expense going forward will be approximately $100 million, including deferred financing cost amortization. \r\nFor the second quarter, the company had a net loss of $98 million or $0.46 per diluted share. Excluding acquisition-related adjustments, the company had net income of $53.5 million or $0.25 per diluted share. \r\nAdjusted net income for the Dollar Tree segment was $138.9 million or $0.67 per adjusted diluted share, a 9.8% increase when compared to the reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.61 per diluted share in the prior year second quarter. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was a benefit of 31.1% compared to an expense of 38.2% in the prior year quarter. The decrease was primarily the result of the pretax income loss in the second -- in the quarter and the nondeductible acquisition costs. \r\nLooking at the balance sheet and statement of cash flow. Combined cash and cash equivalents at quarter end totaled $1.3 billion compared to $467.7 million at the end of the second quarter of 2014. Inventory for the Dollar Tree segment at quarter-end was 6.7% greater than at the same time last year, while selling square footage increased 7.8%. Consolidated inventory per selling square foot decreased 1%. We believe that current inventory levels are appropriate to support scheduled new store openings and our sales initiatives for the third quarter. Consolidated capital expenditures were $100.1 million in the second quarter of 2015 versus $88.3 million in the second quarter of last year. \r\nFor the full year 2015, we're planning for consolidated capital expenditures to range from $600 million to $615 million. Capital expenditures will be focused on new stores and remodels, including additional few development stores; rebanner of select Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree stores; the addition of frozen and refrigerated capability to approximately 425 Dollar Tree stores, up from the previous expectation of 320; IT system enhancements; and the construction of our new Cherokee County, South Carolina distribution center. \r\nDepreciation and amortization totaled $89.5 million for the second quarter versus $49.9 million in the second quarter last year. For 2015, we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to range from $470 million to $490 million. This range includes increases over the traditional run rate of depreciation and amortization expense for Family Dollar for 2 items. First, it includes $46 million of depreciation above the historical run rate for Family Dollar as a result of harmonizing the depreciable lines accounting policies of the 2 companies and the increase in the value of assets based on the purchase price allocation. Secondly, it includes $45 million for the amortization of favorable lease rights for the purchase price valuation of Family Dollar leases. \r\nFor the third quarter, we are forecasting total sales to range from $4.78 billion to $4.87 billion. For the full year of 2015, we are now estimating total sales will range from $15.3 billion to $15.52 billion. Both of these estimates are based on low single-digit same-store sales increase. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 235.7 million shares for Q3 and 223.5 million shares for the full year. \r\nOur expectations for the Dollar Tree segment of our business in the back half have not materially changed from our original expectation as we entered the year. However, as a result of the recently completed acquisition, the significant integration initiatives and the divestiture process, we are not providing earnings per share guidance for the third quarter or full year at this time. \r\nI would like to reiterate that our same-store sales calculation excludes recently acquired Family Dollar stores and excludes stores that are rebannered from Family Dollar to Dollar Tree. We will experience some degree of cannibalization to Dollar Tree comps as part of our rebanner efforts. This cannibalization expectation was planned and factored into both our rebanner strategy analysis and our outlook for same-store sales in the back half of 2015. \r\nI would like to briefly speak to the divestiture process. Related to our acquisition, we reached an agreement to divest 330 Family Dollar stores to Sycamore Partners to satisfy the Federal Trade Commission's divestiture requirements. These 330 stores represent approximately $45.5 million in annual operating income. We're on schedule to close on the divestiture sale later this year. The closing of the divestiture transaction will not change our future net assets because the net effect of the divestiture on Dollar Tree's assets and liabilities are reflected in the consolidated balance sheet in our Form 10-Q being filed today. The divestiture will have 2 effects on our future income: in addition to losing the operating income associated with these 330 stores, we also expect to incur $5 million to $10 million in transaction closing costs and setup costs related to transition services. Over a period expected to be no more than 24 months, we will be providing certain support and transition services and expect to be reimbursed by the buyer for these direct operating costs and support services. \r\nI will now turn the call back over to Bob.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Bob Sasser (Executives)】\nThank you, Kevin. It's an exciting time for Dollar Tree. The strategic rationale for the Family Dollar acquisition is more compelling than ever. This is an extremely large and complex transaction involving more than 13,000 retail store locations and 23 distribution centers, the largest of any previous retail merger, and it will take some time. It is early in the integration process, and I'm more enthusiastic than ever about the long-term opportunity to provide substantially increased shareholder value. \r\nWe have great confidence in our opportunity and ability to achieve at least $300 million in annual run rate synergies by the end of year 3. These synergies will be achieved through a combination of lowering costs in both direct and indirect sourcing, banner optimization, logistics and overhead. We will employ a disciplined approach to driving key strategic initiatives to the combined organization through improved communication, analysis, collaboration and incentives. We're confident that in placing our initial emphasis in these areas, we can materially enhance operating performance of the Family Dollar brand through improvements in sales, margin, expense control and greater customer satisfaction. \r\nBefore we go to Q&A, I'd like to introduce Gary Philbin to our call. Effective immediately upon closing, Gary took over as President and Chief Operating Officer at Family Dollar. This is a key role that had been vacant for about 18 months, and the organization was in need of direction and leadership following the lengthy acquisition process. Many of you already know Gary. We've worked together, improving and growing the Dollar Tree business for the past 15 years, and I have tremendous confidence in his ability as a retailer and as a leader. Gary?\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Gary Philbin (Executives)】\nThank you, Bob, and good morning, everyone. First, let me say we are only 8 weeks into the integration, and we are enthusiastic about the initial progress and this incredible opportunity ahead of us. I'm pleased with the dedication and focus of the entire Family Dollar team. As you know, Family Dollar's a well-established brand that has been successful for more than 50 years. I think our FD, Family Dollar business, is not broken. We simply need to roll up our sleeves, focus on what's important, and we have work to do to polish up this well-known brand. \r\nBob provided a high-level strategic overview of our 100-day action plan. I would like to provide greater detail into the execution components and our areas of focus on improving the Family Dollar's customer shopping experience. \r\nOur goal is to consistently provide great value, affordable prices and relevant items in a store environment that is convenient, clean, reliable and productive. To accomplish this goal, we're going to build on 4 basic fundamentals: great product value, well-run stores, smart choices for our customers and consistency of in-stocks on everyday items. Nothing I said here is new to retail. This is really Retail 101. We are focused on consistent execution, combined with a relentless focus on our customer. It's important to understand that we will be making investments to improve what we refer to table stakes, and these investments will include delivering on the consistency of a clean-store benchmark, catching up on deferred maintenance, investing in the right amount of payroll to drive both productivity and enhance the customer experience and improving the overall efficiency of our in-store processes. \r\nImportantly, we are kicking off a process to clear non-go-forward merchandise in the stores. So you're likely to see clearance activity over the next couple of months as we gear up for having our shelves stocked with basic, everyday items and to show off our great seasonal product. This will have an impact on margins near term, but it's absolutely the right thing to do for our business in the long term. \r\nBefore I turn the call back over to Bob, I just want to say again, I'm proud to be part of the Family Dollar team. I am pleased with the work being done, and I'm excited about the opportunities this will present, both for our vendor community and our Family Dollar team members as we improve and grow the Family Dollar brand. \r\nNow let me turn it back over to Bob.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Bob Sasser (Executives)】\nThank you, Gary. I want to close the prepared remarks by saying that the Dollar Tree business model is powerful, flexible and more relevant than ever, providing extreme value to customers while recording record levels of earnings. Our model has been tested by time and validated by history. For 30 consecutive quarters, Dollar Tree has delivered positive same-store sales increases. Through good times and difficult times in all retail cycles, consumers are looking for value no matter the state of the economy. While our price point remains $1, our operating margin continues to lead the discount sector. \r\nWith the addition of Family Dollar, we're a larger, stronger and more diversified business, better able to serve more customers and more markets with exactly what they're looking for: great value in every store every day. And we have many years of growth ahead of us. Over the past 3 weeks, I've had the privilege to attend and present at both Family Dollar's Annual Leadership Conference and Dollar Tree's annual field management meeting. I could not be more proud of our combined organizations. Our field management and our leadership teams are talented, experienced, energized and incredibly motivated. \r\nOperator, we are now ready for questions.",
      "transcript_text3": "Scot Ciccarelli. A couple of things, can you help us better understand the moving pieces on the Family Dollar side? It looks like even after adjusting for the charges, Kevin, that you outlined, gross margins were dramatically lower than their historical run rate. So whether it's kind of giving us year-over-year comparable figures or a way to kind of build up a bridge to what might be kind of a run -- go-forward run rate number.\n\n---\n\nYes. I think the big thing we got to keep in mind is there are some geography differences in the way we have historically reported our gross profit and the way that the Family Dollar has. So you got to remember, within our gross margin, we have occupancy and distribution costs up there. So within -- that change has been made to Family Dollar's reporting on a go-forward basis, so that's probably the biggest difference that you would see from a comparability standpoint from where it -- from what it traditionally had been reported as, Scot.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then I would like to follow up on that. And then also, as you guys kind of think about Family Dollar, maybe this is for Gary, it's obviously been an underperforming asset for the last couple of years. It sounds like you guys have a lot of kind of go-forward opportunities to fix the business and deep into the plans. But when you think about the profitability opportunity of that entity on a stand-alone basis, do you guys have some sort of kind of medium-term or a long-term profitability target for the Family Dollar segment?\n\n---\n\nScot, thank you. I would just say this. We know the synergy piece that we're working on, and this is going to be a bit of a marathon, not a sprint. But the same things that we've talked about over the years at Dollar Tree play pretty nicely into Family Dollar. And I would just go back to some of the basics we're working on. We are walking the assortments in the store 4 feet by 4 feet to get the assortment right. We are taking a look at store operations to understand how do we improve the processes that drive productivity. We're going to take a very hard look at all of our expense lines so that we can fund those things so we can invest in the customer experience. So it's really just connecting the same dots you've heard us preach over the years here at Dollar Tree, and those are going to be the levers we push to drive to the bottom line.\n\n---\n\nScot, I would just like to add, too, that the -- you've mentioned the short term versus long term. And I will tell you, this is -- we're going to manage this in the short term, but it's the long-term vision that I'm really excited about. It wasn't that long ago that Family Dollar's margins were in the 8% and higher range, operating margin. And certainly, those are in the -- in our near-term sites over the next few years. In the long term, there are others in the sector that are operating at 11%, 12% operating margin. I don't think the operating margin will be as high as the Dollar Tree operating margin because of the nature of our business, the nature of our consumable versus nonconsumable and discretionary business. But certainly, it can be up there amongst others in the discount value sector.\n\n---\n\nSo Bob, just to clarify. Did you say you would expect or believe you can get the Family Dollar business to kind of an 8% margin over the next few years as you guys integrate it?\n\n---\n\nI'll just say that it wasn't that many years ago that it was at that. So certainly, one of our first goals is to get it from where it is now up to where it has been in recent years and then pass that. There's no reason why we can't polish this thing up and get it back to its proper place, which would be up there at the top with others of the same type business.\n\n---\n\nI think previously, you had mentioned a low to mid-single-digit accretion to cash EPS in the first year from the acquisition. So I guess it would now be fiscal '16. Is that still on the table? Or has anything changed in your thought process as you've been able to maybe open the kimono a bit?\n\n---\n\nAs we look at that on a go-forward basis, we stated that back in July of 2014. Obviously, things took obviously a lot longer to close the deal than would have been expected when we made that. The Family Dollar business deteriorated a little bit over that time frame, but time will tell. We don't think it's not possible. There's a lot of moving pieces. I think the other thing you got to remember is, long term, we're really more worried about what the acquisition does for the long term, so we'll have to see. I don't exactly know today, but we'll be there. There's a lot of moving pieces. Obviously, we spoke to a lot of things today about some of the short-term effects from a purchase accounting standpoint, some of those things. Again, some of those are noncash. Some of those do go through the P&L as a regular charge. So a lot of moving pieces, and that's what makes it as complex as it is as we go forward from a comparison standpoint.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And I guess one other clarification just on the Family Dollar business. Is there anything you can talk to in terms of the underlying health and trajectory of that business and how that's factored into the sales plan for the year?\n\n---\n\nAs we looked at it from a sales perspective, as the Family Dollar team looked at that business, I think it's really consistent with the guidance we gave of a low single-digit comp gain. That's really for the Dollar Tree side because the comps -- the Family Dollar stores are not comped. But I think in the back of our mind, there's no reason why they can't in a sense focus and perform at a level like that going forward. So I mean, I think that's just kind of general nature. We expect improvement. Obviously, we've got to go through some processes. We talked about the fact that $60 million reserve to clean up the inventory for nongo-forward items. So it'll be a process there. We hope that, that obviously opens up shelf space as we go forward for the seasonal goods as we go into the fourth quarter and other items that we believe are important to the assortment as we go forward. So a lot of work being done, a lot of moving pieces.\n\n---\n\nGood luck in the back half, looking forward to seeing that 8% margin.\n\n---\n\nNot in the back half.\n\n---\n\nGiven your comments about the product value that you're looking to install in the FDO stores, I'm wondering if you think that the FDO merchandise margins need to be structurally lower than they have been in the past.\n\n---\n\nI'll say that I don't know that it's -- that it need to be structurally lower. I think it's all about the assortment to some degree, serving that value customer. A lot of things go into that. First of all, being competitive on name brands, same -- for same items between our company and others. We need to do that, as always. That's just sort of one of the table stakes. And past there, it's about the mix. It's how do you create value, especially for that low-income customer. There's a big opportunity with private label. There's a big opportunity for control label. There's a big opportunity for product development to create even more value for that low-end customer. So as we speak of serving a low-end customer and bringing value to that customer, there's more than one way to do it, and it's not all about price on name brand products. It's, in many ways, about understanding that customer, giving them what they need. Sometimes, it's a lower retail item. That doesn't speak to the margin, though. It speaks to the opening price point for that customer. So no, I won't tell you that I expect Family Dollar margins to be lower because we're serving the value customer. I think it's all about the way we bring value to that customer.\n\n---\n\nOkay, that's helpful. And then just a quick follow-up. Could you talk to the stability of the FDO store managers and the field teams now that you're kind of into the integration process?\n\n---\n\nWe actually had a chance. Timing is everything, but we had a chance to, with Bob and myself, get in front of the entire district manager leadership team at the beginning of August. So we had a great opportunity of laying out the elements that are important to us and what we need a short-term focus on as we head into the holidays. So it was really a great opportunity to talk about what we need to do. And of course store manager turnover is on our radar and something that we need to improve at Family Dollar. And so those issues and elements were laid out in front of the entire group. I would tell you that they're encouraged, they're positive, they're enthusiastic to move forward. And I think that's going to carry over to the stores. And clearly, some of the things that we're going to invest in over time in the facilities and address issues that make us more productive are the types of things that benefit store managers. So I'm encouraged. I think our folks have taken the opportunity and are going to carry it forward for us, and I would expect to see improvement on store manager turnover, which does a lot of good things for us over the long term.\n\n---\n\nSo aside from some of the inventory dynamics that you mentioned, what else is going to impact your outlook from a profitability perspective in the second half of the year? Because I think it is complex and the fact that it is being less so open-ended may offer the impression that there's too many moving pieces for even the company to project. So how can the investment community be expected to forecast profitability?\n\n---\n\nWell, I think, in Gary's prepared remarks, he touched on some of the items, as you think about the moving pieces, that are still under consideration when you think about the fact that we've only truly been under the hood for 8 weeks. But Gary talked about investments in a cleaner store and the benchmarks appropriately, cleaning up deferred maintenance and making sure the stores are taken care of appropriately and determining what the right level of payroll is in this model to drive productivity and create a more profitable store at the end of the day. So there's still a lot of moving pieces just from the integration side. And then you have -- as well, as I said, you have timing on the divestiture process side as well. At some point in time, these 330 stores will be -- that are currently included in our base will go away. And then we also have costs around that to help support that, as we said. And so the timing of those costs are not as able to be tied down maybe as tight at this moment as we'd like. So there is a lot of moving pieces. I think we know what they are, but it does create a little more uncertainty in creating a number. I mean, we've taken great pride in being able to provide credible guidance, and that's important to us. And we want to make sure that we have the best information to make this -- to be able to make that and give that you at the end of the day.\n\n---\n\nSo my follow-up is going to be a 2-part follow-up. Based on those comments, it sounds like the prior guidance for core Dollar Tree remains relatively intact on a profitability side. And the guidance -- or your commentary on the guidance also suggests that core Dollar Tree is probably going to do a 1% to 1.5% comp in the second half of the year to get to a low single-digit comp for the year. And it also sounds like that's what it did in June and July based on what you're indicating that May had done. So my question is, a, core profitability for Dollar Tree impact; and b, why might you be expecting a 1% to 1.5% comp for core Dollar Tree moving forward. And is that what we should expect longer term?\n\n---\n\nSo look, you are correct on the core Dollar Tree profitability. As I said in my prepared remarks, our viewpoint on really the guidance we gave for Dollar Tree, the most updated guidance would have been at the end of Q1, really, hasn't materially changed from that point in time. Our view on the world has not really changed. As it relates to your question on comp, obviously, we don't give a specific range by number value, but low single digit is a wider range than 1.5%. So I don't know that we would expect a 1.5% at the end of the day. So I think that would be how I would answer that question.\n\n---\n\nBob, I know that there's a lot of science involved in determining locations for Dollar Tree stores. When you look at the Family Dollar stores that have been selected for conversions, how would you characterize the quality of their locations by Dollar Tree standards? And do you think their stores have the potential to generate the same sales per square foot and operating margin rate than an average Dollar Tree store achieves? Or would you expect these converted stores to be somewhat below Dollar Tree profit standards?\n\n---\n\nDan, I would tell you that, first, the Family Dollar site locations, I think that they've got good site locations. Some of them, they're a little off the mark, and they're underperforming for that reason. As you know that over the past few years, I think they opened up a few more in suburban locations than may be normal. I don't know that -- what normal was. But it seemed like, and what I've been told, is that they were aiming more at suburban locations. We see more suburban locations. And as we run those lower-performing stores, we're finding some of those rural and suburban locations that are underperforming that when we run through our model, they turn out to be good Dollar Tree stores. And good Dollar Tree stores meet our Dollar Tree criteria for opening a new Dollar Tree store. These are not -- these are sites that we would open as a Dollar Tree new store and we've been looking at those locations. So what we're taking is the lower-performing stores. They're either lower performing because they're maybe a little off the Family Dollar mark. They're lower performing because maybe the model, the pro formas, weren't exactly aligned. And by the way, with our Dollar Tree margin, we can make a lot of money in a location. Our margins are much higher than the Family Dollar margins. Our mix of product is much different than the Family Dollar product. So a long answer to your question, but these are -- we're looking at these being good Dollar Tree stores. We're taking the lowest-performing and the low-performing Family Dollars, converting them into good Dollar Tree stores. Some of them are going to be breakout home runs, amongst the best of our Dollar Tree stores, on a sales per foot. And some of them are likely going to be underperforming the first year. I believe that the breakout home runs will outweigh. We're early in this, but I believe that breakout home runs will outweigh the underperformers and that most of them are going to be right there in the middle hitting whatever we expected from a Dollar Tree store. It's only been a few weeks. We've only had some grand openings so far. But I will tell you, I'm pleased with the grand openings. And I visited the first 4 test stores when we opened them. I visited all 4 of them, and they look like Dollar Tree stores and they look like Dollar Tree locations and they're in Dollar Tree towns. Customers were pleased to see our Dollar Tree open up in the place of the Family Dollar. So I'm expecting it to be at least as good as a Family -- as a Dollar Tree new store.\n\n---\n\nJust as a follow-up question. After the acquisition was first announced, seems like 10 years ago, but you talked about the opportunities of better buying leverage from common vendors, but it really wasn't until after the closing on July 6 that you were able to study the Family Dollar purchasing file, if I'm correct. Did it turn out that the buying leverage would be greater than what you have been talking about over the last year? Or did it turn out both companies were very effective in buying and maybe there's not going to be as much upside as anticipated?\n\n---\n\nYes. I think it's at least as good in the near term, and I think there may be even more opportunity in the long term. And where I'm coming from, as we -- we sort of knew in the near term, and we got very quickly to that exact match number. That's just a matter of running the finals and seeing which items are exactly the same and what's the -- who's paying the lowest price, right? I mean, somebody's paying -- you're either paying the same or somebody is paying a lower. If you're paying lower then we believe that both of us deserve that lower cost. So that was pretty much as we thought it would be. The big, I think, power going forward, in addition to that, is going to be into the like items. Not exactly the same items, but they're close. It may be a private label item that we compare to, and specs are a little different. So by aligning the specs and putting that out for bid, if it's a basic item, we think -- we know we can drive some more value by combining our buying power of these 2 large businesses on those, and through product development, just leveraging our buying power to develop product for our stores, whether it's Dollar Tree or Family Dollar or both. So huge opportunities continuing on the buying side. The near term is the exact match. The near match or the close match, like items, I guess, is taking a little bit longer, but may even be a bigger part of the synergy as we go forward. And then not to forget all the things that we buy that we don't sell. We just buy them in expense items and services and things that we buy to use. That's about $3 billion that we have to work with, and every dollar we save on expenses drops right straight to the bottom line.\n\n---\n\nJust a real quick question. Do you intend going forward to continue breaking out the Dollar Tree core business separately as you did in the second quarter?\n\n---\n\nWe will try to give color. We are -- if you look at the Q, there is segment reporting. Even in the press release, there's segment reporting. So we will report on 2 segments. We'll have the Dollar Tree banner, and we'll have the Family Dollar banner. So we will have segment reporting going forward, so we'll give you a good idea of how things are performing.\n\n---\n\nBob, you just spoke a bit to buying power and the opportunity there. Can you just clarify for us, on the merchant team, are those merchants still staying separate? And also, how should we think about the category mix within FDO? Or should we expect meaningful changes there? And then lastly, on that same point, as we think about the cadence of the $300 million in synergies, can you help us with what's a prudent assumption for year 1? And what is the main driver of those year 1 synergy?\n\n---\n\nYes, Paul. The -- first of all, the buying teams are staying separate. We have a terrific Dollar Tree buying team that understands and is focused on delivering tremendous value to our Dollar Tree customer for $1 price and at margins that we're pleased to have. We have, at Family Dollar, a separate team focused on that lower-income customer, the needs-based customer, more of a consumer product customer. 70%-ish, something like that, is consumer products. So the buying teams are staying separate. We're connecting them over -- at the top through merchandise managers and divisional vice presidents and that area. We're coordinating or buying with vendors. We're coordinating the activities on items and -- comparing buying plans and merging those as we go onto buying trips, as we go to Asia, as we go to market in, wherever it is, New York, going to shows and that kind of thing. So a lot of coordination, but we -- I believe it's very important to keep the focus clearly on the Family Dollar banner. We intend to continue opening up Family Dollar stores as well as Dollar Tree stores. Sometimes, they're pretty close to each other, so I'd like to be able to do that and have a difference in the banners when you walk inside, have a difference in the merchandise assortment. So the merchandise assortment at Family Dollar is evolving. It will be changing, as we discussed -- as I've discussed in the past. The synergies, I think we've said in the past it's 25% of the synergies in the first year. We think we can get up to 75% of them by the end of the second full year and then 100% by the end of 3 full years. So that's something like, what, 75, 150, 75, something like that. 150 additional in the second year. So 75, 225 and 300 if you look at it that way. The early synergies are across the board. There are going to be a lot of sourcing and procurement. There will be some in banner optimization. I've said that we're going to do over 150 banner -- new -- rebannering stores this year. So that's a real number. Overhead, we're working through that in every segment of our business. Some of that's going to be driven by our information technology integration. Some of it requires the integration of the technology, for example, in logistics. The ability to ship both banners out of every building is going to require a lot of technology help. So that will be probably later in the process. Earlier in the process are the things about overhead and improvements in SG&A through better -- more efficient procurement and through buying power.\n\n---\n\nThat's very helpful. And just quickly, going back to Dollar Tree stand-alone, and I think Mike Lasser touched on this earlier. But could you just help us better understand the revision in the same-store sales guidance from the low single-digit to low mid-single-digit to now, I think, just low single-digit guidance for the full year? What's the nature of that revision? And if you can give us some understanding on the cadence of the comp through the second quarter and any early comments on back-to-school.\n\n---\n\nI can give you a little color on the cadence on the comp side. As I initially said in the prepared remarks that May, driven by a couple of terrific holidays, Mother's Day and Memorial Day, you have that seasonal energy, that holiday excitement. So that drove the highest comps for us. June wasn't far behind. July was running pretty much consistent. We did lose a first of the month to a end-of-July week. So some of that business slipped forward. Anytime the first of the month follows on the weekend, then the checks come out in a different cadence, in this case, versus last year. It all came out -- the first and the third came out last year. This year, only the first checks came out. So there was a little slide in that final week of July. But overall, it was fairly consistent through the quarter. And again, every time there's a great holiday, we have a lot of energy in our Dollar Tree stores and you see more traffic and you see more sales from the holiday. Back-to-school started well. It's not over. One of the things that we're experiencing as well as all of retail, I guess, right now is Labor Day is a week later. Labor Day drives a lot of things in the retail business. It drives seasonal sale at sort of the end of the summer, I guess. The pools close end of the summer for retailers and for customers. And that's when a lot of the school starts. Some schools run year round, I realize, some start at different times. But still, a large percentage of schools start after Labor Day. Well, that's a week later this year. So the sales cadence on our back-to-school looks good, but we still got to -- haven't finished with back-to-school yet. So we'll be finishing that up this weekend. It should be terrific weekend in our Dollar Tree stores. If you have one near, drop in, you'll see a lot of sidewalk sales and summer excitement and all that goes with ending the summer season as well as getting ready to go to back to school.\n\n---\n\nIs there anything -- when you look at Family Dollar, I know you said that the delay in getting the deal approved kind of put a little pressure on Family Dollar and made it a little softer. But is there anything that you've seen that comes as a surprise, specifically, a negative surprise? And I guess I would go back to the question that was just asked. It does seem like your guidance for the second half for Dollar Tree's comp is a little bit softer. Is there anything -- is that right, softer than what it was? And is there anything you would point to that would explain why you feel that's going to be the case?\n\n---\n\nSo Meredith, as you look at the -- people seem to be a little hung up at the moment on this comp guidance. I would tell you that the total sales related to Dollar Tree for the year have changed an immaterial amount within the guidance compared to where they were a quarter ago. So the one thing we did state in our prepared remarks was the fact that there is some cannibalization from the rebannered stores, and we are, as Bob said, doing over 150. So there is some cannibalization we'll feel from those, and that may make us round down from a mid-single digit to a low single digit. But I mean, on an overall basis, as I said, we have not materially changed the way our view is on the Dollar Tree business for the back half.\n\n---\n\nGood. That is what I was thinking you were saying, but people didn't seem to be hearing it. Maybe you could just comment on, then, Family Dollar. Is there anything that has surprised you, either positive or negative, since you've really gotten into it?\n\n---\n\nMeredith, this is Gary. Since I'm on the ground there, I would say, listen, I'm enthusiastic because there's all the opportunities that we thought were there are there. And it's really a matter of getting them in cadence and teeing them up and knocking them down. And I would say, there's nothing on the negative side. We knew going in, how do you enhance the customer experience: that's investing in some labor, that's investing in some store facilities. Those are big projects for us, and so we are going to be measured and disciplined and very prescriptive on how we do that. And that's really the effort that we're putting together now to really lay out a time line on how we can do the things that show customers it's a better shopping experience because we have better in-stocks, we have a better facility and we have team members engaged the way we'd like. And that's really just the nuts and bolts of retail, and it's what we're focused on week in, week out, down at Family Dollar right now.\n\n---\n\nIt's Dan Binder. Just going back to the sales plan for a minute. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit of color on how disruptive it is when you close the stores, have to convert them. It's 4 weeks it sounds like is kind of what you're -- it was recently. Is that what you're planning for the balance of the year on the stores that are remaining? And then with the Family Dollar -- within the Family Dollar business, I realize you're not reporting the comp today for their period. But I was curious, when you think about the go-forward plan, kind of what's that underlying organic growth that we're assuming shorter term?\n\n---\n\nDan, the first rebannered stores: with the 4 that we rebannered, that we started immediately after we closed July 6. We had them completely rebannered and open within 26 days. So 30 days is kind of what we're aiming at. Basically, we close and we go through a process ahead of time where we're selling through and liquidating the Family Dollar inventory. We then close down for about 2 weeks -- 2 more weeks to remerchandise the store, get the rest of the merchandise out of there, get the old fixtures out and get the new fixtures in if there are any needed, not always. Sometimes, we're using the same fixtures. Get the new sign packages in, the new decor package and remerchandise the store. So it's about a 1-month process. Now some of it starts ahead of time because we've identified the stores now ahead of time, and we know which ones we're going to do by month. So we do have a preclosing clearance sale. Gary?\n\n---\n\nDan, just for the first 4 stores, because we could not start markdowns until we closed the transaction, they were accelerated. And so the stores that we've identified in the future have a -- give us a longer runway to appropriately do the markdown. So the first 4, the only difference was we had to do this in a very short window. The teams were able to accomplish that, and we got to the finish line. You will see a more measured time line on the markdowns in the future.\n\n---\n\nThere's another part of the question, I'm trying to...\n\n---\n\nThe other part of the question was sort of the organic growth for Family Dollar stores as we think about the full year guidance.\n\n---\n\nWe -- I will tell you that they were positive in July. Comped positive in July, but they're new stores. So it's less of a comp story now and more of a productivity story. And obviously, we're going to be going through a lot of changes in the remainder of the year. We're so excited about cleaning up the stores. We're so excited about going through the process of rationalizing the assortment, getting rid of old and aged inventory and then replacing that, the space that's opened up from that, with new seasonal product, new promotional product, new high-value product in the stores and what that will do for the customers. In this all-important fourth quarter, we want our customers to see something different. Gary, would you like to...\n\n---\n\nWell, the short term is, for us, just to get very clearly in front of cleaning up some of the old, nongo-forward merchandise so that we can have merchandise on end caps and the best seasonal impact as we can going to the important holiday season. From the standpoint of store growth, initially, there was a number out there around 550 on Family Dollar for their fiscal year. Appropriately, that dropped down to about 300. So we have slowed down store growth as we take a look under the hood, take a look at the assortments to drive sales per square foot. I'm sitting in on every real estate meeting to identify, really, what's the strategy, where is it working or do we need to recalibrate. And so we'll take a look on both sides of that ledger, where does Family Dollar work best, and really, more than anything, how do we find the right compelling assortments and our operational initiatives to drive higher sales productivity.\n\n---\n\nAnd then just as a follow-up, can you give us a little more color on how many stores you ultimately plan to convert? And as you go through this integration, slower Family Dollar store growth makes sense. I'm just curious as you think about the next 2 years beyond this year. I think you just said 300 for this year. What would that -- what would you anticipate that to look like?\n\n---\n\nDan, it's 150 -- more than 150 this year. It's as many as we can get done between now and the end of October. Obviously, we want to stop at that point and pay attention to our fourth quarter business, and then we'll pick up again next year. I have really not quantified the total number because there is still work in progress there. It's hundreds. I've said it's hundreds, and I believe it's hundreds of stores that will have the opportunity. There's -- the analysis is ongoing. As we go through more analysis, we'll get more firm direction. The 150-plus number for this year was a new number for you. But as far as how many for next year, we'll share that as we get a little more certainty on the locations and where those are going to be.\n\n---\n\nYes. That was really sort of a 2-part question. I'm sorry if I confused you. I was -- the 300, I was talking about new store openings for Family Dollar. I was just curious what that would look like during the integration period as you consider growth for the Family Dollar format next year and the third year.\n\n---\n\nWell, obviously, we pull back until we can get our more productive new store model and more productive merchandise assortment in the stores. We don't want to be investing and opening a lot of new stores until we know that we're going to have what the model is and it has great success. So in the near term, we pull back. As Gary described, we'll pull back to -- when I say pull back, from peak numbers that Family Dollar has done. Next year will be a pull-back year also. Past that, I think we've got to say that as we get more confidence in the new model, we'll ramp it back up. It's there to be done. There's plenty of room for the Family Dollar stores. We're excited about what we can do with it. We just need this time for the rest of this year and probably next year in order to get confidence that the new model -- now we'll open up stores, but it won't be the peak numbers that we've seen in the past. But we need a little confidence that the new models are going to hit the pro formas.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Rochelle, and thank you for joining us for today's call and for your continued interest in Dollar Tree. Our next quarterly earnings conference call is scheduled for November 24. Thank you, and have a good day.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Scot Ciccarelli (Analysts)】\nScot Ciccarelli. A couple of things, can you help us better understand the moving pieces on the Family Dollar side? It looks like even after adjusting for the charges, Kevin, that you outlined, gross margins were dramatically lower than their historical run rate. So whether it's kind of giving us year-over-year comparable figures or a way to kind of build up a bridge to what might be kind of a run -- go-forward run rate number.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kevin Wampler (Executives)】\nYes. I think the big thing we got to keep in mind is there are some geography differences in the way we have historically reported our gross profit and the way that the Family Dollar has. So you got to remember, within our gross margin, we have occupancy and distribution costs up there. So within -- that change has been made to Family Dollar's reporting on a go-forward basis, so that's probably the biggest difference that you would see from a comparability standpoint from where it -- from what it traditionally had been reported as, Scot.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scot Ciccarelli (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then I would like to follow up on that. And then also, as you guys kind of think about Family Dollar, maybe this is for Gary, it's obviously been an underperforming asset for the last couple of years. It sounds like you guys have a lot of kind of go-forward opportunities to fix the business and deep into the plans. But when you think about the profitability opportunity of that entity on a stand-alone basis, do you guys have some sort of kind of medium-term or a long-term profitability target for the Family Dollar segment?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gary Philbin (Executives)】\nScot, thank you. I would just say this. We know the synergy piece that we're working on, and this is going to be a bit of a marathon, not a sprint. But the same things that we've talked about over the years at Dollar Tree play pretty nicely into Family Dollar. And I would just go back to some of the basics we're working on. We are walking the assortments in the store 4 feet by 4 feet to get the assortment right. We are taking a look at store operations to understand how do we improve the processes that drive productivity. We're going to take a very hard look at all of our expense lines so that we can fund those things so we can invest in the customer experience. So it's really just connecting the same dots you've heard us preach over the years here at Dollar Tree, and those are going to be the levers we push to drive to the bottom line.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Bob Sasser (Executives)】\nScot, I would just like to add, too, that the -- you've mentioned the short term versus long term. And I will tell you, this is -- we're going to manage this in the short term, but it's the long-term vision that I'm really excited about. It wasn't that long ago that Family Dollar's margins were in the 8% and higher range, operating margin. And certainly, those are in the -- in our near-term sites over the next few years. In the long term, there are others in the sector that are operating at 11%, 12% operating margin. I don't think the operating margin will be as high as the Dollar Tree operating margin because of the nature of our business, the nature of our consumable versus nonconsumable and discretionary business. But certainly, it can be up there amongst others in the discount value sector.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scot Ciccarelli (Analysts)】\nSo Bob, just to clarify. Did you say you would expect or believe you can get the Family Dollar business to kind of an 8% margin over the next few years as you guys integrate it?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Bob Sasser (Executives)】\nI'll just say that it wasn't that many years ago that it was at that. So certainly, one of our first goals is to get it from where it is now up to where it has been in recent years and then pass that. There's no reason why we can't polish this thing up and get it back to its proper place, which would be up there at the top with others of the same type business.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Stephen Grambling (Analysts)】\nI think previously, you had mentioned a low to mid-single-digit accretion to cash EPS in the first year from the acquisition. So I guess it would now be fiscal '16. Is that still on the table? Or has anything changed in your thought process as you've been able to maybe open the kimono a bit?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kevin Wampler (Executives)】\nAs we look at that on a go-forward basis, we stated that back in July of 2014. Obviously, things took obviously a lot longer to close the deal than would have been expected when we made that. The Family Dollar business deteriorated a little bit over that time frame, but time will tell. We don't think it's not possible. There's a lot of moving pieces. I think the other thing you got to remember is, long term, we're really more worried about what the acquisition does for the long term, so we'll have to see. I don't exactly know today, but we'll be there. There's a lot of moving pieces. Obviously, we spoke to a lot of things today about some of the short-term effects from a purchase accounting standpoint, some of those things. Again, some of those are noncash. Some of those do go through the P&L as a regular charge. So a lot of moving pieces, and that's what makes it as complex as it is as we go forward from a comparison standpoint.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Stephen Grambling (Analysts)】\nOkay. And I guess one other clarification just on the Family Dollar business. Is there anything you can talk to in terms of the underlying health and trajectory of that business and how that's factored into the sales plan for the year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kevin Wampler (Executives)】\nAs we looked at it from a sales perspective, as the Family Dollar team looked at that business, I think it's really consistent with the guidance we gave of a low single-digit comp gain. That's really for the Dollar Tree side because the comps -- the Family Dollar stores are not comped. But I think in the back of our mind, there's no reason why they can't in a sense focus and perform at a level like that going forward. So I mean, I think that's just kind of general nature. We expect improvement. Obviously, we've got to go through some processes. We talked about the fact that $60 million reserve to clean up the inventory for nongo-forward items. So it'll be a process there. We hope that, that obviously opens up shelf space as we go forward for the seasonal goods as we go into the fourth quarter and other items that we believe are important to the assortment as we go forward. So a lot of work being done, a lot of moving pieces.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Stephen Grambling (Analysts)】\nGood luck in the back half, looking forward to seeing that 8% margin.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kevin Wampler (Executives)】\nNot in the back half.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matt Nemer (Analysts)】\nGiven your comments about the product value that you're looking to install in the FDO stores, I'm wondering if you think that the FDO merchandise margins need to be structurally lower than they have been in the past.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Bob Sasser (Executives)】\nI'll say that I don't know that it's -- that it need to be structurally lower. I think it's all about the assortment to some degree, serving that value customer. A lot of things go into that. First of all, being competitive on name brands, same -- for same items between our company and others. We need to do that, as always. That's just sort of one of the table stakes. And past there, it's about the mix. It's how do you create value, especially for that low-income customer. There's a big opportunity with private label. There's a big opportunity for control label. There's a big opportunity for product development to create even more value for that low-end customer. So as we speak of serving a low-end customer and bringing value to that customer, there's more than one way to do it, and it's not all about price on name brand products. It's, in many ways, about understanding that customer, giving them what they need. Sometimes, it's a lower retail item. That doesn't speak to the margin, though. It speaks to the opening price point for that customer. So no, I won't tell you that I expect Family Dollar margins to be lower because we're serving the value customer. I think it's all about the way we bring value to that customer.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matt Nemer (Analysts)】\nOkay, that's helpful. And then just a quick follow-up. Could you talk to the stability of the FDO store managers and the field teams now that you're kind of into the integration process?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gary Philbin (Executives)】\nWe actually had a chance. Timing is everything, but we had a chance to, with Bob and myself, get in front of the entire district manager leadership team at the beginning of August. So we had a great opportunity of laying out the elements that are important to us and what we need a short-term focus on as we head into the holidays. So it was really a great opportunity to talk about what we need to do. And of course store manager turnover is on our radar and something that we need to improve at Family Dollar. And so those issues and elements were laid out in front of the entire group. I would tell you that they're encouraged, they're positive, they're enthusiastic to move forward. And I think that's going to carry over to the stores. And clearly, some of the things that we're going to invest in over time in the facilities and address issues that make us more productive are the types of things that benefit store managers. So I'm encouraged. I think our folks have taken the opportunity and are going to carry it forward for us, and I would expect to see improvement on store manager turnover, which does a lot of good things for us over the long term.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Lasser (Analysts)】\nSo aside from some of the inventory dynamics that you mentioned, what else is going to impact your outlook from a profitability perspective in the second half of the year? Because I think it is complex and the fact that it is being less so open-ended may offer the impression that there's too many moving pieces for even the company to project. So how can the investment community be expected to forecast profitability?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kevin Wampler (Executives)】\nWell, I think, in Gary's prepared remarks, he touched on some of the items, as you think about the moving pieces, that are still under consideration when you think about the fact that we've only truly been under the hood for 8 weeks. But Gary talked about investments in a cleaner store and the benchmarks appropriately, cleaning up deferred maintenance and making sure the stores are taken care of appropriately and determining what the right level of payroll is in this model to drive productivity and create a more profitable store at the end of the day. So there's still a lot of moving pieces just from the integration side. And then you have -- as well, as I said, you have timing on the divestiture process side as well. At some point in time, these 330 stores will be -- that are currently included in our base will go away. And then we also have costs around that to help support that, as we said. And so the timing of those costs are not as able to be tied down maybe as tight at this moment as we'd like. So there is a lot of moving pieces. I think we know what they are, but it does create a little more uncertainty in creating a number. I mean, we've taken great pride in being able to provide credible guidance, and that's important to us. And we want to make sure that we have the best information to make this -- to be able to make that and give that you at the end of the day.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Lasser (Analysts)】\nSo my follow-up is going to be a 2-part follow-up. Based on those comments, it sounds like the prior guidance for core Dollar Tree remains relatively intact on a profitability side. And the guidance -- or your commentary on the guidance also suggests that core Dollar Tree is probably going to do a 1% to 1.5% comp in the second half of the year to get to a low single-digit comp for the year. And it also sounds like that's what it did in June and July based on what you're indicating that May had done. So my question is, a, core profitability for Dollar Tree impact; and b, why might you be expecting a 1% to 1.5% comp for core Dollar Tree moving forward. And is that what we should expect longer term?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kevin Wampler (Executives)】\nSo look, you are correct on the core Dollar Tree profitability. As I said in my prepared remarks, our viewpoint on really the guidance we gave for Dollar Tree, the most updated guidance would have been at the end of Q1, really, hasn't materially changed from that point in time. Our view on the world has not really changed. As it relates to your question on comp, obviously, we don't give a specific range by number value, but low single digit is a wider range than 1.5%. So I don't know that we would expect a 1.5% at the end of the day. So I think that would be how I would answer that question.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Wewer (Analysts)】\nBob, I know that there's a lot of science involved in determining locations for Dollar Tree stores. When you look at the Family Dollar stores that have been selected for conversions, how would you characterize the quality of their locations by Dollar Tree standards? And do you think their stores have the potential to generate the same sales per square foot and operating margin rate than an average Dollar Tree store achieves? Or would you expect these converted stores to be somewhat below Dollar Tree profit standards?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Bob Sasser (Executives)】\nDan, I would tell you that, first, the Family Dollar site locations, I think that they've got good site locations. Some of them, they're a little off the mark, and they're underperforming for that reason. As you know that over the past few years, I think they opened up a few more in suburban locations than may be normal. I don't know that -- what normal was. But it seemed like, and what I've been told, is that they were aiming more at suburban locations. We see more suburban locations. And as we run those lower-performing stores, we're finding some of those rural and suburban locations that are underperforming that when we run through our model, they turn out to be good Dollar Tree stores. And good Dollar Tree stores meet our Dollar Tree criteria for opening a new Dollar Tree store. These are not -- these are sites that we would open as a Dollar Tree new store and we've been looking at those locations. So what we're taking is the lower-performing stores. They're either lower performing because they're maybe a little off the Family Dollar mark. They're lower performing because maybe the model, the pro formas, weren't exactly aligned. And by the way, with our Dollar Tree margin, we can make a lot of money in a location. Our margins are much higher than the Family Dollar margins. Our mix of product is much different than the Family Dollar product. So a long answer to your question, but these are -- we're looking at these being good Dollar Tree stores. We're taking the lowest-performing and the low-performing Family Dollars, converting them into good Dollar Tree stores. Some of them are going to be breakout home runs, amongst the best of our Dollar Tree stores, on a sales per foot. And some of them are likely going to be underperforming the first year. I believe that the breakout home runs will outweigh. We're early in this, but I believe that breakout home runs will outweigh the underperformers and that most of them are going to be right there in the middle hitting whatever we expected from a Dollar Tree store. It's only been a few weeks. We've only had some grand openings so far. But I will tell you, I'm pleased with the grand openings. And I visited the first 4 test stores when we opened them. I visited all 4 of them, and they look like Dollar Tree stores and they look like Dollar Tree locations and they're in Dollar Tree towns. Customers were pleased to see our Dollar Tree open up in the place of the Family Dollar. So I'm expecting it to be at least as good as a Family -- as a Dollar Tree new store.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Wewer (Analysts)】\nJust as a follow-up question. After the acquisition was first announced, seems like 10 years ago, but you talked about the opportunities of better buying leverage from common vendors, but it really wasn't until after the closing on July 6 that you were able to study the Family Dollar purchasing file, if I'm correct. Did it turn out that the buying leverage would be greater than what you have been talking about over the last year? Or did it turn out both companies were very effective in buying and maybe there's not going to be as much upside as anticipated?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Bob Sasser (Executives)】\nYes. I think it's at least as good in the near term, and I think there may be even more opportunity in the long term. And where I'm coming from, as we -- we sort of knew in the near term, and we got very quickly to that exact match number. That's just a matter of running the finals and seeing which items are exactly the same and what's the -- who's paying the lowest price, right? I mean, somebody's paying -- you're either paying the same or somebody is paying a lower. If you're paying lower then we believe that both of us deserve that lower cost. So that was pretty much as we thought it would be. The big, I think, power going forward, in addition to that, is going to be into the like items. Not exactly the same items, but they're close. It may be a private label item that we compare to, and specs are a little different. So by aligning the specs and putting that out for bid, if it's a basic item, we think -- we know we can drive some more value by combining our buying power of these 2 large businesses on those, and through product development, just leveraging our buying power to develop product for our stores, whether it's Dollar Tree or Family Dollar or both. So huge opportunities continuing on the buying side. The near term is the exact match. The near match or the close match, like items, I guess, is taking a little bit longer, but may even be a bigger part of the synergy as we go forward. And then not to forget all the things that we buy that we don't sell. We just buy them in expense items and services and things that we buy to use. That's about $3 billion that we have to work with, and every dollar we save on expenses drops right straight to the bottom line.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Wewer (Analysts)】\nJust a real quick question. Do you intend going forward to continue breaking out the Dollar Tree core business separately as you did in the second quarter?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kevin Wampler (Executives)】\nWe will try to give color. We are -- if you look at the Q, there is segment reporting. Even in the press release, there's segment reporting. So we will report on 2 segments. We'll have the Dollar Tree banner, and we'll have the Family Dollar banner. So we will have segment reporting going forward, so we'll give you a good idea of how things are performing.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Trussell (Analysts)】\nBob, you just spoke a bit to buying power and the opportunity there. Can you just clarify for us, on the merchant team, are those merchants still staying separate? And also, how should we think about the category mix within FDO? Or should we expect meaningful changes there? And then lastly, on that same point, as we think about the cadence of the $300 million in synergies, can you help us with what's a prudent assumption for year 1? And what is the main driver of those year 1 synergy?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Bob Sasser (Executives)】\nYes, Paul. The -- first of all, the buying teams are staying separate. We have a terrific Dollar Tree buying team that understands and is focused on delivering tremendous value to our Dollar Tree customer for $1 price and at margins that we're pleased to have. We have, at Family Dollar, a separate team focused on that lower-income customer, the needs-based customer, more of a consumer product customer. 70%-ish, something like that, is consumer products. So the buying teams are staying separate. We're connecting them over -- at the top through merchandise managers and divisional vice presidents and that area. We're coordinating or buying with vendors. We're coordinating the activities on items and -- comparing buying plans and merging those as we go onto buying trips, as we go to Asia, as we go to market in, wherever it is, New York, going to shows and that kind of thing. So a lot of coordination, but we -- I believe it's very important to keep the focus clearly on the Family Dollar banner. We intend to continue opening up Family Dollar stores as well as Dollar Tree stores. Sometimes, they're pretty close to each other, so I'd like to be able to do that and have a difference in the banners when you walk inside, have a difference in the merchandise assortment. So the merchandise assortment at Family Dollar is evolving. It will be changing, as we discussed -- as I've discussed in the past. The synergies, I think we've said in the past it's 25% of the synergies in the first year. We think we can get up to 75% of them by the end of the second full year and then 100% by the end of 3 full years. So that's something like, what, 75, 150, 75, something like that. 150 additional in the second year. So 75, 225 and 300 if you look at it that way. The early synergies are across the board. There are going to be a lot of sourcing and procurement. There will be some in banner optimization. I've said that we're going to do over 150 banner -- new -- rebannering stores this year. So that's a real number. Overhead, we're working through that in every segment of our business. Some of that's going to be driven by our information technology integration. Some of it requires the integration of the technology, for example, in logistics. The ability to ship both banners out of every building is going to require a lot of technology help. So that will be probably later in the process. Earlier in the process are the things about overhead and improvements in SG&A through better -- more efficient procurement and through buying power.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Trussell (Analysts)】\nThat's very helpful. And just quickly, going back to Dollar Tree stand-alone, and I think Mike Lasser touched on this earlier. But could you just help us better understand the revision in the same-store sales guidance from the low single-digit to low mid-single-digit to now, I think, just low single-digit guidance for the full year? What's the nature of that revision? And if you can give us some understanding on the cadence of the comp through the second quarter and any early comments on back-to-school.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Bob Sasser (Executives)】\nI can give you a little color on the cadence on the comp side. As I initially said in the prepared remarks that May, driven by a couple of terrific holidays, Mother's Day and Memorial Day, you have that seasonal energy, that holiday excitement. So that drove the highest comps for us. June wasn't far behind. July was running pretty much consistent. We did lose a first of the month to a end-of-July week. So some of that business slipped forward. Anytime the first of the month follows on the weekend, then the checks come out in a different cadence, in this case, versus last year. It all came out -- the first and the third came out last year. This year, only the first checks came out. So there was a little slide in that final week of July. But overall, it was fairly consistent through the quarter. And again, every time there's a great holiday, we have a lot of energy in our Dollar Tree stores and you see more traffic and you see more sales from the holiday. Back-to-school started well. It's not over. One of the things that we're experiencing as well as all of retail, I guess, right now is Labor Day is a week later. Labor Day drives a lot of things in the retail business. It drives seasonal sale at sort of the end of the summer, I guess. The pools close end of the summer for retailers and for customers. And that's when a lot of the school starts. Some schools run year round, I realize, some start at different times. But still, a large percentage of schools start after Labor Day. Well, that's a week later this year. So the sales cadence on our back-to-school looks good, but we still got to -- haven't finished with back-to-school yet. So we'll be finishing that up this weekend. It should be terrific weekend in our Dollar Tree stores. If you have one near, drop in, you'll see a lot of sidewalk sales and summer excitement and all that goes with ending the summer season as well as getting ready to go to back to school.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Meredith Adler (Analysts)】\nIs there anything -- when you look at Family Dollar, I know you said that the delay in getting the deal approved kind of put a little pressure on Family Dollar and made it a little softer. But is there anything that you've seen that comes as a surprise, specifically, a negative surprise? And I guess I would go back to the question that was just asked. It does seem like your guidance for the second half for Dollar Tree's comp is a little bit softer. Is there anything -- is that right, softer than what it was? And is there anything you would point to that would explain why you feel that's going to be the case?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kevin Wampler (Executives)】\nSo Meredith, as you look at the -- people seem to be a little hung up at the moment on this comp guidance. I would tell you that the total sales related to Dollar Tree for the year have changed an immaterial amount within the guidance compared to where they were a quarter ago. So the one thing we did state in our prepared remarks was the fact that there is some cannibalization from the rebannered stores, and we are, as Bob said, doing over 150. So there is some cannibalization we'll feel from those, and that may make us round down from a mid-single digit to a low single digit. But I mean, on an overall basis, as I said, we have not materially changed the way our view is on the Dollar Tree business for the back half.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Meredith Adler (Analysts)】\nGood. That is what I was thinking you were saying, but people didn't seem to be hearing it. Maybe you could just comment on, then, Family Dollar. Is there anything that has surprised you, either positive or negative, since you've really gotten into it?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gary Philbin (Executives)】\nMeredith, this is Gary. Since I'm on the ground there, I would say, listen, I'm enthusiastic because there's all the opportunities that we thought were there are there. And it's really a matter of getting them in cadence and teeing them up and knocking them down. And I would say, there's nothing on the negative side. We knew going in, how do you enhance the customer experience: that's investing in some labor, that's investing in some store facilities. Those are big projects for us, and so we are going to be measured and disciplined and very prescriptive on how we do that. And that's really the effort that we're putting together now to really lay out a time line on how we can do the things that show customers it's a better shopping experience because we have better in-stocks, we have a better facility and we have team members engaged the way we'd like. And that's really just the nuts and bolts of retail, and it's what we're focused on week in, week out, down at Family Dollar right now.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Binder (Analysts)】\nIt's Dan Binder. Just going back to the sales plan for a minute. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit of color on how disruptive it is when you close the stores, have to convert them. It's 4 weeks it sounds like is kind of what you're -- it was recently. Is that what you're planning for the balance of the year on the stores that are remaining? And then with the Family Dollar -- within the Family Dollar business, I realize you're not reporting the comp today for their period. But I was curious, when you think about the go-forward plan, kind of what's that underlying organic growth that we're assuming shorter term?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Bob Sasser (Executives)】\nDan, the first rebannered stores: with the 4 that we rebannered, that we started immediately after we closed July 6. We had them completely rebannered and open within 26 days. So 30 days is kind of what we're aiming at. Basically, we close and we go through a process ahead of time where we're selling through and liquidating the Family Dollar inventory. We then close down for about 2 weeks -- 2 more weeks to remerchandise the store, get the rest of the merchandise out of there, get the old fixtures out and get the new fixtures in if there are any needed, not always. Sometimes, we're using the same fixtures. Get the new sign packages in, the new decor package and remerchandise the store. So it's about a 1-month process. Now some of it starts ahead of time because we've identified the stores now ahead of time, and we know which ones we're going to do by month. So we do have a preclosing clearance sale. Gary?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gary Philbin (Executives)】\nDan, just for the first 4 stores, because we could not start markdowns until we closed the transaction, they were accelerated. And so the stores that we've identified in the future have a -- give us a longer runway to appropriately do the markdown. So the first 4, the only difference was we had to do this in a very short window. The teams were able to accomplish that, and we got to the finish line. You will see a more measured time line on the markdowns in the future.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Bob Sasser (Executives)】\nThere's another part of the question, I'm trying to...\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Binder (Analysts)】\nThe other part of the question was sort of the organic growth for Family Dollar stores as we think about the full year guidance.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Bob Sasser (Executives)】\nWe -- I will tell you that they were positive in July. Comped positive in July, but they're new stores. So it's less of a comp story now and more of a productivity story. And obviously, we're going to be going through a lot of changes in the remainder of the year. We're so excited about cleaning up the stores. We're so excited about going through the process of rationalizing the assortment, getting rid of old and aged inventory and then replacing that, the space that's opened up from that, with new seasonal product, new promotional product, new high-value product in the stores and what that will do for the customers. In this all-important fourth quarter, we want our customers to see something different. Gary, would you like to...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gary Philbin (Executives)】\nWell, the short term is, for us, just to get very clearly in front of cleaning up some of the old, nongo-forward merchandise so that we can have merchandise on end caps and the best seasonal impact as we can going to the important holiday season. From the standpoint of store growth, initially, there was a number out there around 550 on Family Dollar for their fiscal year. Appropriately, that dropped down to about 300. So we have slowed down store growth as we take a look under the hood, take a look at the assortments to drive sales per square foot. I'm sitting in on every real estate meeting to identify, really, what's the strategy, where is it working or do we need to recalibrate. And so we'll take a look on both sides of that ledger, where does Family Dollar work best, and really, more than anything, how do we find the right compelling assortments and our operational initiatives to drive higher sales productivity.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Binder (Analysts)】\nAnd then just as a follow-up, can you give us a little more color on how many stores you ultimately plan to convert? And as you go through this integration, slower Family Dollar store growth makes sense. I'm just curious as you think about the next 2 years beyond this year. I think you just said 300 for this year. What would that -- what would you anticipate that to look like?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Bob Sasser (Executives)】\nDan, it's 150 -- more than 150 this year. It's as many as we can get done between now and the end of October. Obviously, we want to stop at that point and pay attention to our fourth quarter business, and then we'll pick up again next year. I have really not quantified the total number because there is still work in progress there. It's hundreds. I've said it's hundreds, and I believe it's hundreds of stores that will have the opportunity. There's -- the analysis is ongoing. As we go through more analysis, we'll get more firm direction. The 150-plus number for this year was a new number for you. But as far as how many for next year, we'll share that as we get a little more certainty on the locations and where those are going to be.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Binder (Analysts)】\nYes. That was really sort of a 2-part question. I'm sorry if I confused you. I was -- the 300, I was talking about new store openings for Family Dollar. I was just curious what that would look like during the integration period as you consider growth for the Family Dollar format next year and the third year.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Bob Sasser (Executives)】\nWell, obviously, we pull back until we can get our more productive new store model and more productive merchandise assortment in the stores. We don't want to be investing and opening a lot of new stores until we know that we're going to have what the model is and it has great success. So in the near term, we pull back. As Gary described, we'll pull back to -- when I say pull back, from peak numbers that Family Dollar has done. Next year will be a pull-back year also. Past that, I think we've got to say that as we get more confidence in the new model, we'll ramp it back up. It's there to be done. There's plenty of room for the Family Dollar stores. We're excited about what we can do with it. We just need this time for the rest of this year and probably next year in order to get confidence that the new model -- now we'll open up stores, but it won't be the peak numbers that we've seen in the past. But we need a little confidence that the new models are going to hit the pro formas.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Randy Guiler (Executives)】\nThank you, Rochelle, and thank you for joining us for today's call and for your continued interest in Dollar Tree.

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you, Tanisha. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Red Hat's earnings call for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Speakers for today's call will be Jim Whitehurst, President and CEO; Frank Calderoni, Executive Vice President of Operations and CFO. Our earnings press release was issued today after the market closed and may be downloaded from redhat.com on the Investor Relations page. Also on this page, you'll be able to find a copy of today's transcript, a schedule of currency rates and new financial highlights and supplemental metrics that include a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial results.\r\nVarious remarks that we may make about the company's future expectations, plans, prospects, including statements containing the words believe, anticipate, plan, project, estimate, expect, intend or will constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\r\nActual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the company's most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC as well as the Safe Harbor statement in today's press release.\r\nIn addition, any forward-looking statement represents our estimates or views only as of today, September 21, 2015, and these estimates or views may change. While the company may elect to update forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so even if our estimates or views do change, and therefore, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as representing our estimates or views as any date subsequent to today.\r\nAnd with that, let me turn the call over to Jim.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Tom, and let me add my welcome to all of you joining us on today's call. I also want to personally welcome Frank Calderoni to his first earnings call with Red Hat. I'm very pleased to have Frank join the Red Hat leadership team, where his capabilities and experience will add value and strength as we look to scale our business to the next level in the years ahead.\r\nIn Q2, we continued to drive and benefit from the adoption of open hybrid cloud technologies, as companies look to modernize the data center and on-ramp to the cloud. We also continued to build momentum for our technologies that enable a new mode of application development, where agility, continuous deployment and enhanced customer experience are key deliverables for CIOs. With these trends and strong execution by all Red Hat associates, I'm pleased to announce that our second quarter results exceeded our guidance, and we are increasing our outlook for the year, as Frank will detail in a few minutes.\r\nIn addition, we passed 2 milestones of note during the quarter. First, we exceeded the $0.5 billion mark in quarterly revenues for a run rate of over $2 billion annually. Second, we achieved an annual run rate of $100 million from our Certified Cloud and Service Provider program. We reached this milestone due in part to the addition of new customers and the expanded utilization of RHEL in production workloads in public clouds.\r\nWith that overview, let me discuss a few of our recent technology highlights. First, we kicked off Q2 with our premier user event, the Red Hat Summit in Boston, with record attendance, energy and excitement were high as our customers led sessions on how they use Red Hat technologies to improve their businesses' agility, scale and flexibility. Customers such as Intuit, Volvo, Target, Bloomberg and FICO spoke about their experience implementing our cloud infrastructure technologies, such as OpenStack and CloudForms.\r\nFor our OpenShift PaaS solution, we had customers such as Amadeus, Cisco, Barclays, DreamWorks and Telus speak about the benefits of Red Hat technology and Linux containers for application development and easier production deployment. We believe the strength of our offerings, combined with great endorsements from innovative companies, will help us to further drive adoption of Red Hat's cloud solutions across both public, private and cloud deployments.\r\nIn conjunction with the Summit, we launched the latest version of our PaaS solution, OpenShift Enterprise 3, a container-based application platform. Our enhanced platform, which uses the Docker container format is powered by RHEL to offer a more secure, efficient and portable way to develop, deploy and run application services. OpenShift 3 also includes Kubernetes, a container orchestration and management engine developed with Google. Docker, Kubernetes, Linux and OpenShift Origin, which are each part of OpenShift 3 are all open source projects, where Red Hat is leading -- where Red Hat is a leading contributor. Our leadership in the upstream community enables us to bring these technologies together to make it easier for enterprises to consume open source innovation.\r\nAlso, at the Summit, we continued to expand our Linux container offerings with Red Hat Atomic enterprise platform, utilizing the same core-enabling technologies as OpenShift 3, including Docker and Kubernetes, Atomic Enterprise provides a platform for executing multi-container applications. It is designed to help organizations orchestrate across traditional and cloud-native applications while scaling to meet changing business demands.\r\nAt Summit, we also announced an exciting new alliance with Samsung Electronics that aims to deliver the next generation of mobile solutions for the enterprise. The alliance draws on the breadth of Samsung's mobile device portfolio fused with the depth of Red Hat's open source middleware, mobile and cloud technologies to deliver mobile solutions that facilitate rapid development and integration of enterprise applications for organizations moving towards a mobile-first strategy. We are making great progress in mobile and have been recently named by Forrester Research in \"The Forrester Wave Mobile Infrastructure Services\" report. In the report, Red Hat received the highest cumulative score for vendor strategy based on strength of vision, customer satisfaction, speed to market and partner alliances.\r\nMore recently, in August, we launched RHEL OpenStack platform 7 based on the Kilo release. Version 7 includes several new features aimed at accelerating the adoption of OpenStack, including simplified operational management and resource provisioning, high availability, greater security control and network flexibility. We have deployed this new version of OpenStack internally and at several large global customers with enthusiastic reviews.\r\nIn summary, we executed well in the first half of 2016, and I want to thank all Red Hat's associates around the globe for their focus on achieving these results. As we look ahead, I believe we are well positioned for the second half of the year as we continue to execute on behalf of our customers to deliver innovation and solutions to solve their challenges.\r\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Frank.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Jim. It's a great time to be at Red Hat, and I'm truly very excited to be part of the team. One of the top priorities that remain is our continued focus on creating value for our shareholders, our customers, employees as well as our partners. Our company's growth initiatives, along with our expanding portfolio of solution, positions us very well within the marketplace. I look forward to working with the investors and the analysts who follow us.\r\nI'm pleased to share that Q2 was another strong quarter with results that exceeded our guidance. Based on the strength of our Q2 and a positive view on the remainder of the year, we are raising our full year outlook as I will detail in a moment. \r\nFirst, I will focus my remarks on the financial highlights of our Q2 performance, which is a practice I will do my best to follow so that we can maximize the amount of time in our call dedicated to answering your questions. For a more detailed view of our results and metrics, please refer to our press release, the presentation materials and the transcript of our prepared remarks that are available in the Investor Relations section of redhat.com.\r\nHere are some of the Q2 financial highlights. Total revenue for the quarter was $504 million, which grew 21% on a year-over-year basis in constant currency, or 13% in U.S. dollars. Taking into account the fluctuation of foreign exchange rates, total revenue would have been $37 million or 820 basis points higher using the rates from Q2 of last year. As a result of the FX volatility, I will provide both U.S. dollar and constant currency results for the quarter using the rates from Q2 last year where it's appropriate. In U.S. dollars, we exceeded the high end of our revenue guidance by $8 million. Our improved revenue performance this quarter resulted from better-than-expected execution, improved linearity and upsides in our public cloud business and our customer education and compliance program. \r\nThe main driver of our total revenue growth was subscription revenue of $442 million, an increase of 21% in constant currency and 13% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. In USD, this renewable revenue stream now constitutes 88% of total revenue, which provides us with a high level of future revenue visibility and predictability.\r\nBreaking out the subscription revenue by technology. The subscription revenue for our infrastructure-related offering was $363 million, an increase of 17% in constant currency and 9% year-over-year in USD. Subscription revenue for application development-related and emerging technologies offerings was $79 million, an increase of 48% in constant currency and 37% year-over-year in USD. Application development-related and emerging technologies revenue grew to approximately 16% of total revenue in USD, and that's up from 13% from a year ago.\r\nOn a non-GAAP basis, operating income grew 13% and non-GAAP operating margin was 24.4%. This non-GAAP operating margin was approximately 140 basis points above our guidance due to the strong revenue growth. We had record hiring of approximately 400 associates this quarter, which puts us on track to add approximately 1,200 associates this year, which has been our investment goal. We added approximately 600 associates year-to-date.\r\nUsing our estimated annual effective tax rate of 29%, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share came to $0.47, and that's $0.03 above our guidance. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of approximately $2 billion, and this balance was after returning $70 million to shareholders after repurchasing approximately 895,000 shares of Red Hat stock. We had approximately $430 million remaining on the current share repurchase authorization at the end of the quarter.\r\nTotal deferred revenue at quarter end was $1.4 billion, an increase of $162 million or 13% over the same quarter a year ago. On a constant currency basis, the total deferred revenue would have been up 20%. The total change in deferred revenue from a cash flow statement that neutralizes most of the impact of the currency changes was a decline of $25 million. Operating cash flow of $120 million for the quarter was up 12% year-over-year, and year-to-date operating cash flow was up 21%.\r\nOur rolling 4 quarter's billing proxy is calculated by adding revenue plus the change in deferred revenue on the cash flow statement for the last 4 quarters. On a rolling 4 quarters basis, the billings proxy was $539 million, up 16% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, this metric would have been up 22%, a modest increase from a year-ago quarter and continues to demonstrate the momentum that we have in our business. This metric also reflects the higher bookings duration that we had last year and the 20-month average duration that we've experienced through the first half of this year. As we look ahead, we would expect the bookings duration for the second half of fiscal 2016 to be closer to the historic 21-month level.\r\nNow let's look at some of the metrics of the business momentum and some of the large deals in the quarter. On a geographic basis, this quarter's 60% of bookings came from the Americas, 22% from EMEA and 18% from Asia-Pacific, versus a 59-24-17 split in Q2 of last year. We continue to deliver globally despite the FX headwind.\r\nThe Q2 sales route-to-market mix was 75% from the channel and 25% from the direct sales force, and this is versus 69-31 split in Q2 of last year. Consistent with Q2 of last year, we closed a large number of channel deals, and we're making progress toward our annual goal of a 70-30 split.\r\nNow let me give you some additional details on the largest deals and our renewals that closed in the quarter. Within our top largest -- 30 largest deals metric, all 30 were approximately $1 million or more. We had 4 deals that were in excess of $5 million, and we had 1 deal that was well over $10 million. \r\nCross-selling was strong with 65% of the deals including one or more components from our group of application development and emerging technologies offering. We expect the growing adoption of these technologies like Middleware, the RHEL OpenStack platform, OpenShift, cloud management and storage, to continue to drive revenue growth. The top vertical for the quarter was financial, followed closely by mainstream customers in health care, transportation and retail verticals.\r\nOn our renewal business, I'm pleased to share that once again, we renewed all of the top 25 deals that were up for renewal. The total subscription value of these top 25 renewals was approximately 115% of the prior value.\r\nNow I would like to turn to guidance, which will factor in the solid performance we had in the first half of the fiscal year, and our outlook assumes similar business conditions and foreign exchange rates as of September 18, 2015, which included a dollar to euro of 1.13 and a yen to dollar of 121. \r\nWith these assumptions, we are raising our full year revenue guidance to $2.034 billion to $2.044 billion, up approximately 14% in USD or approximately 20% in constant currency. We are modestly increasing the operating margin to a target of 23.6%, and we're raising the cash flow to $690 million to $705 million. We're also increasing our target for full year non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $1.85 to $1.87 per share, assuming a 29% annual effective tax rate and a $1 million per quarter forecast for other income.\r\nOur guidance also reflects our focused investment in our application development in emerging technologies that we believe will further drive future growth.\r\nFor Q3, specifically, I offer the following outlook. We expect revenue to be in the range of $519 million to $523 million, which is up 15% in USD or at the high end of the range of approximately 20% in constant currency; non-GAAP operating income of approximately 23%; non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.47.\r\nConsistent with prior practices at Red Hat, I will not forecast quarterly cash flow. However, I would suggest that while estimating cash flow, you use the AR balance as your starting point.\r\nIn summary, we are pleased with the very solid performance in the first half of the fiscal year. And with our broad portfolio of solutions and strong execution, we believe we will become the first open source company to exceed $2 billion in annual revenue.\r\nOperator, I'd now like to turn the call back over to you for the first question.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Tom McCallum (Executives)】\nThank you, Tanisha. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Red Hat's earnings call for the second quarter of fiscal 2016.

I also want to personally welcome Frank Calderoni to his first earnings call with Red Hat. I'm very pleased to have Frank join the Red Hat leadership team, where his capabilities and experience will add value and strength as we look to scale our business to the next level in the years ahead.\r\nIn Q2, we continued to drive and benefit from the adoption of open hybrid cloud technologies, as companies look to modernize the data center and on-ramp to the cloud. We also continued to build momentum for our technologies that enable a new mode of application development, where agility, continuous deployment and enhanced customer experience are key deliverables for CIOs. With these trends and strong execution by all Red Hat associates, I'm pleased to announce that our second quarter results exceeded our guidance, and we are increasing our outlook for the year, as Frank will detail in a few minutes.\r\nIn addition, we passed 2 milestones of note during the quarter. First, we exceeded the $0.5 billion mark in quarterly revenues for a run rate of over $2 billion annually. Second, we achieved an annual run rate of $100 million from our Certified Cloud and Service Provider program. We reached this milestone due in part to the addition of new customers and the expanded utilization of RHEL in production workloads in public clouds.\r\nWith that overview, let me discuss a few of our recent technology highlights. First, we kicked off Q2 with our premier user event, the Red Hat Summit in Boston, with record attendance, energy and excitement were high as our customers led sessions on how they use Red Hat technologies to improve their businesses' agility, scale and flexibility. Customers such as Intuit, Volvo, Target, Bloomberg and FICO spoke about their experience implementing our cloud infrastructure technologies, such as OpenStack and CloudForms.\r\nFor our OpenShift PaaS solution, we had customers such as Amadeus, Cisco, Barclays, DreamWorks and Telus speak about the benefits of Red Hat technology and Linux containers for application development and easier production deployment. We believe the strength of our offerings, combined with great endorsements from innovative companies, will help us to further drive adoption of Red Hat's cloud solutions across both public, private and cloud deployments.\r\nIn conjunction with the Summit, we launched the latest version of our PaaS solution, OpenShift Enterprise 3, a container-based application platform. Our enhanced platform, which uses the Docker container format is powered by RHEL to offer a more secure, efficient and portable way to develop, deploy and run application services. OpenShift 3 also includes Kubernetes, a container orchestration and management engine developed with Google. Docker, Kubernetes, Linux and OpenShift Origin, which are each part of OpenShift 3 are all open source projects, where Red Hat is leading -- where Red Hat is a leading contributor. Our leadership in the upstream community enables us to bring these technologies together to make it easier for enterprises to consume open source innovation.\r\nAlso, at the Summit, we continued to expand our Linux container offerings with Red Hat Atomic enterprise platform, utilizing the same core-enabling technologies as OpenShift 3, including Docker and Kubernetes, Atomic Enterprise provides a platform for executing multi-container applications. It is designed to help organizations orchestrate across traditional and cloud-native applications while scaling to meet changing business demands.\r\nAt Summit, we also announced an exciting new alliance with Samsung Electronics that aims to deliver the next generation of mobile solutions for the enterprise. The alliance draws on the breadth of Samsung's mobile device portfolio fused with the depth of Red Hat's open source middleware, mobile and cloud technologies to deliver mobile solutions that facilitate rapid development and integration of enterprise applications for organizations moving towards a mobile-first strategy. We are making great progress in mobile and have been recently named by Forrester Research in \"The Forrester Wave Mobile Infrastructure Services\" report. In the report, Red Hat received the highest cumulative score for vendor strategy based on strength of vision, customer satisfaction, speed to market and partner alliances.\r\nMore recently, in August, we launched RHEL OpenStack platform 7 based on the Kilo release. Version 7 includes several new features aimed at accelerating the adoption of OpenStack, including simplified operational management and resource provisioning, high availability, greater security control and network flexibility. We have deployed this new version of OpenStack internally and at several large global customers with enthusiastic reviews.\r\nIn summary, we executed well in the first half of 2016, and I want to thank all Red Hat's associates around the globe for their focus on achieving these results. As we look ahead, I believe we are well positioned for the second half of the year as we continue to execute on behalf of our customers to deliver innovation and solutions to solve their challenges.\r\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Frank.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Frank Calderoni (Executives)】\nThanks, Jim.

      "transcript_text3": "Jim, I wanted to ask you going back to the Red Hat Summit, you had commented that you were supply constrained in your OpenStack business. Since then, you have launched RHEL OSP 7 and I believe the installer has been materially improved. So I'm just wondering, in general, could you comment on the progress in making OpenStack more consumable? And maybe what would be your best estimate of how long it would take to enable real mainstream consumability for OpenStack?\n\n---\n\nWell, it certainly made a big leap forward with OSP 7 because we have an installer. We -- it does a really good job of kind of identifying hardware and lighting it up. Of course, that means there's a lot of work to do around certifying that hardware, making sure it lights up appropriately, et cetera, et cetera. So our customers who have been using it have generally been thrilled. We've had some specific-hardware platforms we've been a little challenged on, so we've been kind of working through those components. And obviously, that eats up some professional services resources. But in general, it's allowed us to have a couple of big wins. One of the very large global telcos chose RHEL OSP, a very, very large financial services institution again chose RHEL OSP both this quarter. I think a lot of it was due to the progress that we've made. Mark, there are really 2 pieces around, I think, getting it truly in mainstream, running production applications. One is continuing to make it simpler. And I think we made a big step forward and we'll continue to do that. The other is some more high-availability features, right? So one of the, I think, issues or features with OpenStack is its scalability. But it's basically kind of assuming applications that are stateless. And so continue to build more high-availability features and to allow it to run traditional application is something we've been talking a lot to customers about. So I think there's a general belief that OpenStack is going to be a kind of low-cost platform of choice with customers going forward. But there's a sense that \"Hey, Red Hat, you need to help us take some of our existing applications and migrate them onto OpenStack.\" So we're actively working with some customers on that. So hard to say exactly when these technologies go, but we're starting to see a lot more production applications start to move. Again, these are early adopters doing this. So this isn't quite mainstream, but really pleased with the progress we're seeing there.\n\n---\n\nYes, and the other thing that helps, too, is just the thousands of engineers that are certified and that continues to grow very rapidly. So that includes -- that expands the amount of adoption from the standpoint of OpenStack overall. So we're excited about that.\n\n---\n\nAnd Frank, I just had a quick follow-up for you. I was curious, would you be able to provide for us the sequential FX impact to the -- to both of the deferred revenue lines as had been done, I think, in the recent past? And also just to clarify, on the contractors for Q3 and Q4, I think if I'm interpreting that correctly, then we will not see the same kind of increase in the long-term deferreds in the back half of the year. Could you just comment on whether that's accurate?\n\n---\n\nMark, one of things we added this quarter is a presentation. And in that presentation, it actually lists the real change to the deferred revenue you see on the cash flow statement. So I think I'd refer you to that specifically to find it.\n\n---\n\nIt's in the page, it's under the cash flow statement. You'll see the numbers laid out there by quarter on Page 10 of the document.\n\n---\n\nAnd Mark, I don't -- I mean, let me ask Frank -- I didn't understand your second question around contract duration. First half of the year, it's been kind of more 20 months, and we expect it to kind of go back more towards 21. I didn't understand your question. If anything, that kind of improves billings performance, right?\n\n---\n\nWell, the only thing as far as the contract duration, Mark, there's couple of things that we talked about as far as the benefits of this quarter. We saw, of course, an improvement in the cloud business -- the public cloud business. And as you know, that is recorded in arrears. So that's more realtime business, not necessarily deferred business. So that's going to affect the overall mix of contract. The other thing, too, is we had strength in the government business, which is also another good sign, another quarter of very good strength in our government business. And the government business tends to be a 12-month business. So those 2 elements have a higher percentage of the mix that's going to kind of put a little bit of pressure on the contract -- on the average contract length. So not necessarily anything to be concerned about, it's just a matter of the mix of the business. But as Jim mentioned, what we expect is in the back half of the year, to see it more towards the historic average of 21 months.\n\n---\n\nMaybe to follow on, on the cloud question. Two questions there. One, can you give us some kind of indications on sort of the type of business that you're seeing going into these public cloud environments in particular. I think historically, you guys have talked about it being mostly net new workloads. Are you seeing any shifting of workloads into these public cloud environments? And then the second question, maybe for Frank, it sounds like cloud outperformed your expectations this quarter. Is there any way to sort of quantify or what that -- if it wasn't cloud what that impact to billings might have been this quarter or how we could think about more maybe a normalized number on the billing side?\n\n---\n\nYes. So I'll start. I mean, again, the Certified Cloud Provider program revenue that we talk about is basically people going to public clouds and buying RHEL, right? So that is typically net new customers because if you have an existing relationship, we have a vehicle for you to purchase and run your subscriptions, whether it's on-premise or on RHEL, right? So those are generally net new workloads and net new customers. One of the very, very large public cloud providers collect that data would they ask, \"Are you a Red Hat customer?\" and the vast majority is new to us. We see some customers taking advantage of being able to run RHEL on public clouds. But recognize, and this is -- more and more seems to be settling out, as I talked to our large customers, for dev and test or for applications that are bearing a lot workloads where elasticity is important. Public cloud has a lot of benefit. But once workload has been up and running, and it is kind of -- it reach kind of a stable, predictable amount, a lot of our large customers or data centers prefer to run those in their data centers. So we're not seeing a lot of people saying, \"Hey, I'm taking an existing application and moving it into the cloud.\" It's more new workloads are being built to run either permanently or often temporarily in the cloud. And so they settle down the performance characteristics and the intention is moving it back in. So it's hard to -- because people are thinking applications essentially running across, it's hard to directly answer that question. So that's one of the piece of benefits that we provide, right? Your right to -- our infrastructure, you can run on public cloud or in your own data center.\n\n---\n\nAnd so what we're going to be selling to new customers is kind of provides support for those new workloads. And as you probably know, we have 80 Red Hat-certified public cloud providers on a global basis. So that allows us a good channel to be able to take advantage of that opportunity. And he wanted a question about...\n\n---\n\nOh, workload. Normalizing...\n\n---\n\nYes, so if you look at the cloud business, so let's say it's $100 million run rate. So give it about $25 million on a quarterly basis. It's kind of realtime business so the impact that you would see to, let's say, billings, could be approximately $20 million.\n\n---\n\nThe question I had is more for Jim. Jim, if you look in the OpenStack conversations you have with clients, what's the kind of discussion you have with them? Are they kind of looking at open source and then you just provide a vendor there? Or is it kind of like VMware, Microsoft or maybe Microsoft and then you guys? How does that work at the moment? Is it like -- so the first decision is to go open source, open and with you or is it kind of very much like between the proprietary guys and you guys?\n\n---\n\nWell, I guess, 2 things. One is, I think, it's typically OpenStack and then we have to explain why OpenStack, so that decision is made first. But I want to be clear, it's rarely a single decision. Virtually, anyone is going to have a Microsoft environment in their infrastructure. And so they're obviously thinking about whether that's going to be on a Microsoft infrastructure or on VMware and -- or Azure, et cetera, et cetera. Most companies want to then have a separate infrastructure -- so 2 different infrastructures, right? So you want to have a proprietary and an open, so you can get into how big those things are going to be. But there's always going to be a Microsoft footprint there. I think that generally benefit us because, frankly, a lot of -- customers will say, I'm going to have a Microsoft footprint, but I want to have my second one be VMware because there's -- that gives me 2 different proprietary ones and does that necessarily help me in the long run. So I do think we're benefiting from the fact that the alternative to Microsoft, I think, more and more people are thinking open as they're think about their next generation. And so we -- and we obviously do well there. And then it comes down to really with, especially the early adopters, we do get a lot of am I going to buy Red Hat OpenStack now or later? I think most kind of see us as we'll be the Red Hat of OpenStack. And the question is do they want to consume something closer to the trunk or are they ready to stabilize now? So the big telco I mentioned started off with we call it a snowflake, so they started off working with a primarily professional services firm, doing work on OpenStack where they've added in some of their own features. After a couple of RHEVs realized that, that was going to be hard to maintain long term and came to us. So I think, again, we have a good value story once it's OpenStack. And there's a natural sense that OpenStack is going to be at least one of the 2 platforms that most enterprises are looking at deploying.\n\n---\n\nFrank, there were a few questions from investors regarding the first half of billings number. I know there are a number of moving pieces. But I was curious if you could just maybe provide a little more color related around -- it looked weak as it relates to FX adjusted and as reported. We're want wondering -- maybe understand the deferred is growing nicely, just what your puts and takes were there.\n\n---\n\nSure. Sure. That would -- Brent, I'd definitely do that. So I know a lot of it has to do with -- and I'm just kind of looking at the last couple of quarters, about some of what, let's say, the expectation is. So upfront, I just want to mention as everyone knows, we do not provide any forecast on billings because it's difficult to kind of forecast. And one of the things I looked at over the last week or so, if you look at some of the range of what the estimates were, it's about a $30-plus million range between the high and the low. But if we've -- and we've done a lot of analysis on the billings, at least I have, in the last few weeks. And looking at them, I'm really pretty proud of the stats that we have this quarter. One of the things from a billings perspective, just to kind of go through it, so billings proxy, as we look at it, will be the revenue and the change in deferred. So for the quarter, we had about $479 million. So that's up 9% in dollars and 17% in constant currency. And that's fairly consistent when you look at the performance we had in the last Q2, right, from the standpoint of a modest increase year-on-year. I mentioned earlier about the contract duration for the first half. So it was about 20 months. So slightly below the historic level of the 21 months, and we talked about that, and the strength of that was -- what caused that was more related to the public cloud and the government business. And we're expecting it to kind of move back into the 21 months. But if you look underneath the billings, the short-term billings, which we think is probably a better gauge when you take into consideration the points I mentioned about the contract duration, which looked at it over a 12-month period, in Q2, the billings were about $484 million. And that was up about 13% in dollars and 21% in constant currency. And then another view, and I know I'm throwing a lot of numbers out there, but just this is part of the analysis I looked at, so looking at short-term billings but also looking at what we think is probably a better trend view of the business when you're looking at billings, is to look at a rolling average 4-quarter billings proxy, which is revenue plus the change in deferred on a cash flow statement over the 4 quarters. And the importance of this is that it deals with the seasonality of our business, especially when you kind of look at the back half of the year. It also takes in consideration some of the variations that we have in currency. And if you look at it as of the end of Q2, that number was $539 million. That was up 16% year-on-year in dollars and it was up 22% year-on-year in constant currency. So -- and if I look back at what that rolling average was for the last 4, 5 quarters, it was about 20% or higher with the current number being at 22% at the highest number. So again, I think it's a good indication of how it's trending along with what we're seeing from a revenue standpoint. So again, as I said, we're pretty proud of how that's working out.\n\n---\n\nThat was a very helpful explanation, Frank. So I just wanted to check at that point. So at this point, we should then, again, expect that we should see a little bit more flow-through, I would assume, in the next couple of quarters into cash flow. And I'm sorry to be a little bit vague about this here. But anyway, so that's good. I appreciate that. Just one other question. So I guess it's more for Jim on OpenStack. Can you be a little bit more specific about your competition versus Mirantis, Canonical perhaps and HP and how that's going?\n\n---\n\nYes. Well, we feel, I think, very good and certainly encouraged versus even kind of a year ago. We frankly don't see a lot of head-to-head against HP. We do see Mirantis more. We've had several wins or people who were moving away from Mirantis to RHEL. Our value proposition very much is a -- we lock down. We build a certification kind of infrastructure. Everything will work with a defined light, which as OpenStack continues to mature, becomes even more valuable. And so Mirantis has done some good work for customers, but often, that is starting off with a code base but then tailoring it and modifying it to a customer's needs. And that feels good in the short run. But again, RHEV, OpenStack forward and you have a whole patch set. You're trying to RHEV forward because it's not pushed upstream, customers, frankly, get frustrated. And so we have seen migrations as customers have said, \"Oh, no, now I'm either stuck on an old one or I got to migrate this patch set. Maybe it is time to standardize on a company that drives [ph] everything upstream first,\" which is obviously what we've been talking about for a long time. And so I do think that's starting to -- even customers who were initially skeptical of that, who are now kind of going through that pain, are starting to come back to us. So I feel good about the competition and the way that's going. I think you mentioned that only 3 companies we see. Nothing is -- Canonical, we rarely -- I have yet to see a case where we've competed with them. I think it is Mirantis and HP. And again, HP must be in more of their kind of own kind of heavily dominant HP hardware customers because we certainly don't see them playing in places where there are other hardware platforms, which is the majority of what I think of as the large customers out there. So again, I think as any technology matures more, our value proposition only gets stronger. So again, I think we're starting to see some things that, frankly, we have lost a year or 2 ago starting to come back our way.\n\n---\n\nJust looking at your app dev and emerging segment, that's a solid growth, 48% constant currency growth. But that all seems to [indiscernible] your products, your middleware, storage and cloud front. So many different products. Just wondering if you could give some color in terms of any strength you see in any particular product in this quarter or any kind of trend that you're seeing.\n\n---\n\nYes. We don't break out details there. What I would tell you is there are 2 legs to what I think of is that Red Hat growth kind of momentum. One is we still have a significant amount of share take from established vendors. So if you look especially across the JBoss portfolio, we like to talk about the mobile and some of the newer technologies, and there are certainly drivers. But WebSphere to WebLogic. ILog into the JBoss portfolio. A lot of these kind of older, very expensive middleware technologies to JBoss, which is what I think of it is pure commoditization. Our integration technologies, our BPM technologies, all of those are growing quite nicely. I think a lot of that's being driven not necessarily by kind of new cloud-type workloads. Those are just vendor management. We can come in with equivalent solutions that dramatically lower cost. And so that's driving -- so there's that still -- in the same way, UNIX to Linux and Windows to Linux continues to happen. There's a lot happening, especially in the middleware portfolio as customers are still starting to see Red Hat as a long-term enterprise partner. They're starting to move the middleware stacks that way. Now then obviously, the second pillar is as enterprises are building new infrastructure and building applications for that next-generation scale-out infrastructure, we win a chunk there. So those are the 2 main themes. We don't break out the numbers around it. But -- and I know we talk a lot on the cloud theme, but I don't want to forget the theme of we're continuing to take significant share in the traditional data center, which is still the vast majority of the dollars that are spent on IT broadly. And it also will allow us to pivot well. In down markets, we talk about value, value, value. In up markets, we talk about innovation. And we're credible at both of those stories.\n\n---\n\nAs we talked about, I mean, the cross-selling is important, 65% this past quarter. Just some stats on some of the transactions. We talked about the top 30 deals. But looking at some of the top 30 deals with some of the emerging products, we had 4 in OpenStack; we had 2 in OpenShift; 5 in Storage. So Storage really saw an uptick this quarter. The other thing is when you -- Jim was talking about the middleware. We had 5 transactions with Fuse, right, which we haven't seen in a while. So those are all good indications of some of the traction that we're getting with our customers. And then also, last week, we had a customer advisory board where we bring together our customers on an annual basis, CIOs, and we were talking about mostly the emerging products. And it was great for me, first experience I've had, to be able to listen in and see how enthusiastic they were about some of the investments that they're making or that they plan to make.\n\n---\n\nJim, I wanted to touch on OpenShift. And I know that in the market, there was some discussion about 2 points. Number one, that the early adoption of containers is happening really almost exclusively within just RHEV 2.0 companies and that we weren't seeing broader adoption in commercial. And I was wondering -- my first question for you, perhaps, I don't know. Secondly, people had raised questions about security, not knowing what's in the container and maybe suggesting that running those [ph] containers as VMs is a more secure option. Wondering if you have comments on both of those points.\n\n---\n\nSure, yes. Let me start off saying we just had our Strategic Advisory Board but I also go out and see a lot of customers' containers and thinking about how to consume and manage containers is the single biggest topic that comes up among what I think of as leading -- technology leading. So financial services, technology and telco customers, without a doubt, more than, frankly, I even hear about OpenStack. And it's -- so certainly, certainly far beyond web companies. One kind of public example is Amadeus is building their kind of new platform for their new workloads around OpenShift 3. And their desire is for all their new workloads to be running -- dockerizing containers on OpenShift v3. So it is something -- and what you actually hear, even the infrastructure people at financial services institutions, I was talking to one week ago, 1.5 weeks ago, and he was basically saying I don't have a choice because my developers are delivering containers. And I'm going to have to be able to manage them and so Red Hat run as fast as you can because it's not just about taking the container. As you said, it's about security. It's about management, all the telemetry you need to understand performance bottlenecks and all of that kind of work that still is being done. And so the Atomic platform that we talked about is something a lot of customers are interested in. Literally every industry all walks, again, not because the infrastructure people necessarily want it because -- but the developers are picking it up because it's so much more productive for developers. So the interesting thing about containers, I want to emphasize this over and over, is you can build a story around efficiency of running your infrastructure. That is not what's driving this. Developer efficiency is what is driving this. And literally, I had a CIO tell me I've lost control, really. Developers are going to do this. We have to make sure that we can consume these. On your security point, there are several issues around security. The point you made about what's in the container is critically important. And virtualization does nothing to help you with that, right? You got to recognize that what's in the container is basically the user space side of the operating system. We did an analysis where we wrote a Hello World app in 4 different languages and looked back what packages would need to be subsumed into each of those, and we did like Java, node, so JavaScript. We did PHP. And we looked back over the last year how many security updates had been made that would affect those containers. And depending on the language, it varies from 30 to 50 in the last year. So understanding what's in the container and understanding how you can push updates into that is critical. Obviously, it's an operating system vendor. Our ability to do that, we believe, is far superior to anyone else because we obviously track these packages and know kind of what, when and how security updates need to be pushed. So we actually think that's -- as a commercial vendor, that is a very, very good thing for us because that allows us to kind of tell a security story. Now you are right. There's a separate set of security, which does come around bare metal versus virtualize, which is around certain name spaces, ability to get to certain I/O, filesystems and making sure those are separate. We -- there's 2 parallels paths there. One is to run it virtualized because we've hit a lot of that virtualization, and certainly, many of our customers are running OpenShift on OpenStack as a way to resolve that, or you can run it on VMware as well. At the same time, obviously, the Linux community is driving towards bare metal solutions to that same set of problems as we continue to push that forward. If you look at RHEL 7.2, there are several kind of steps forward in the technology around security around containers. So yes, security is an issue. To some extent, that's a good thing for Red Hat in that allows us to shine with what we do, both in terms of manageability and security updating, et cetera, et cetera. Sorry, that's a long answer, but it's a subtle but important point.\n\n---\n\nI just had one housekeeping one and then a follow-up. The first one was just regarding contract duration. I know you said it was 20 months for the first half. But did you specifically say it was also 20 months for the fiscal second quarter? And then, Jim, I just wanted to follow up with you. I mean, you've had a lot of great enhancements with version 7 of your OpenStack platform. I'm just wondering. Obviously, you said you've seen you're running it internally. You've seen some kind of early customers run with it. When do you think we start seeing this as a meaningful contributor to billings? And I'm just wondering if this is something that you'll ultimately be sharing with us kind of an update on similar to your public cloud milestone that you announced this quarter.\n\n---\n\nSo Heather, the contract duration in Q1 and Q2 was both 20.\n\n---\n\nIn terms of OpenStack, again, we are still with what I would say the earlier adopters running OpenStack. And some of the deals are quite large because they're large implementations, but they are very lumpy as well. The total dollars is not of a size like the public cloud revenues. So until it's a little bit more of a business that is a little more stable, has a little more visibility, it really wouldn't be appropriate to share that. In terms of your question around when is it going to be a material chunk of revenue, we're -- hard to say. It's starting to pick up. But we're still a little bit of a ways away before it's kind of what I would say truly material contributor.\n\n---\n\n$2 billion.\n\n---\n\nYes, $2 billion of revenue.\n\n---\n\nI wanted to return to the cloud mix. The move from $36 million run rate to $100 million run rate in 6 quarters is pretty impressive. And I've got 2 questions. One is I know that comes from 80 certified public cloud providers. But could you offer a little color on which specific public cloud infrastructures are driving the bulk of that growth? I presume it's AWS, but I'd love to hear your commentary. And secondly, maybe this is for Frank. Frank, as more of your bookings come from this avenue, could you remind us what the impact is on profitability and operating cash flow as the mix slowly shifts to the cloud?\n\n---\n\nI'll start on the breakdown, and then Frank can get into impacts around some of the profitability. It is obviously highly skewed to one very large private -- or public could provider as you can imagine, very large share overall. And I think our share reflects that as well. I don't think we're skewed otherwise relative to their share, but there is one cloud provider that's kind of well ahead of the others that I think you all know. Beyond that, there are a few, what I'll say, a collection of 7 or 8 cloud providers, I would say, are more enterprise-focused. You can kind of imagine kind of who a couple of those are, who target -- these are enterprise names that target enterprise. Those we have much larger than, I would say, kind of our normal share. And then there's a long tail of others out there that just kind of spreads out. So we do well on that true enterprise-focused ones and then AWS is large cloud provider of the West Coast. So I don't know, probably the top 10 represents 90% of the business, 85%. I don't have the numbers exactly front of me.\n\n---\n\nAs far as the profitability, we don't necessarily break out segments of the business and look at the individual P&Ls. But I will tell you, just on what I've learned in the last couple of months here, and this is part of our subscription business, I would not think it would be materially different, the profitability of the cloud business versus the rest. Because if I look at the overall margins, the subscription business has been pretty much in line with that 94%. And even as the number has been growing, it really hasn't had any material impact on the overall margins. So I'm pretty comfortable that's probably consistent.\n\n---\n\nAnd on the cash flow?\n\n---\n\nWell, it hurts cash flow. It hurts cash flow because again, people are paying as they go versus upfront. So it would be -- if we weren't growing, it wouldn't matter. But because of our growth rate, it's certainly kind of in the short run, in the ramp phase, it reduces billings and cash flow a bit.\n\n---\n\nVersus if we would do it otherwise.\n\n---\n\nRight, just because we're charging as we go versus charging a year upfront.\n\n---\n\nRight, right.\n\n---\n\nGot it. Very helpful and obviously the fact that you put up great operating cash flow and have held subscription gross margins attests to the strength of the business despite that impact to the cloud.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Wonderful. Jim, I'm not going to let you off the hook. Because we have a spent a material amount of time discussing OpenStack, I want to hear you, if not revenue, I'm not asking for revenue, but could you give us some feel for the number of instances that have gone live, number of service [ph] that have gone live or a number of instances sold, divided by a number of instances in production or number of logos that have bought the product, some feel for some early indicator? And one for you, Frank, given your experience at Cisco, what are the things that you see at Red Hat that are opportunities?\n\n---\n\nI don't know if I have any good number that I could share around that. I mean, we have hundreds of POCs working their way through various parts of the system. So it's certainly hundreds, and I would say most major names that you can imagine are in some level of trial around it. I don't have a good number other than something kind of in the hundreds at some point in the sales cycle, not just, I mean, like POC all the way through. So again, it's going really nicely from our perspective. But in terms of out the other side, a lot of production running, we -- I just don't have a set of numbers. We don't quite track it that way to be able to give you a sense. I'll try to do better with some more numbers on that side next quarter.\n\n---\n\nMaybe for Christmas present.\n\n---\n\nThere you go.\n\n---\n\nAs far as your question as far as the opportunity, I mean, I think I mentioned this at the Summit when we had the analyst meeting. And I can really say this again now having been a part of Red Hat for 3 months and also looking at it when I was at Cisco. The key thing I see here is just the opportunity for further growth. I heard it -- as I mentioned before last week with some of the customers that we had at the customer advisory board, I see it whether it's in -- we're talking a lot today about OpenStack and OpenShift. We talk about our Storage business. We look at middleware. And you look at where CIOs and companies are going to be making their investment. I think we have a huge opportunity from that perspective. And the key thing for us is going to be able to scale to meet that opportunity, and that's really where I hope to play a key role.\n\n---\n\nI have a question for Jim. Jim, Microsoft made some comments, I believe it was last week, about Linux. I think they're calling it as Azure Cloud Switch. I'm curious to get your thoughts on that. And I know we talked in the past about the public cloud business, and the big one you seem to be missing is Azure. I'm curious, what are some of the things in terms of the thinking about potentially running RHEL and Azure at some point?\n\n---\n\nWell look, we want to serve our customers' needs, right, flat out. So with customer demand, we will work to be where our customers want to be. It's hard for me to talk about a specific provider. We have over 100. We just recently added VMware, vCloud Air. So you can imagine Microsoft and the history around it that's a different beast, but I hope we can -- well, we expect to and will have our platform running anywhere our customers want to run it.\n\n---\n\nAnd what about -- I just wondering about some of the stuff they talked about last week with Cloud Switch. Maybe you can talk about them and Linux.\n\n---\n\nWell, I mean, I think that there's -- I think they figured out there's a lot of amazing technology that's out in the open, driven by user-driven innovation and some of that they need to consume themselves. And so I think they're certainly much more pragmatic around open source than perhaps they were a couple of years ago. And I think this is a prime example where there's a set of things they need around Azure, and it's kind of already kind of best provided in open stores. And so I'm actually very encouraged with -- by Satya and his stance around open source.\n\n---\n\nI guess first for Jim, just a question on the Windows market. And I'd say you appear to be gaining some share pretty consistently against Windows. Are there any workloads you could point to that you think maybe recently have helped you really accelerate some of those gains that looks like you're having?\n\n---\n\nWell, 2 things. First off, Big Data, right? I mean, Big Data has a natural affinity to Linux because of Hadoop and all of those things that originally were written and are kind of native on Linux. But the big one is just all of these new kind of -- whether it's, call it, systems of engagement or Mode 2 in general, which are the scale-out infrastructure type of workloads. Those are -- I don't want to say exclusively on an open platform, but the vast majority are in an open platform. So again, as people are thinking about their next generation, whether it's a mobile workload, as they think about whatever that next kind of cloud or web-type workload, it's highly, highly likely that, that's going to go on Linux, not on Windows. And obviously, for enterprise customers, that's very highly likely that it's going to be the Red Hat stack. So that's why obviously, we're working hard around containers, around OpenStack. This is a natural affinity to the rest of our product suite in that as customers think about mobile and most of the mobile things out there are happening in languages, frameworks, et cetera, and open, they're already moving towards open, probably going to run that on open source infrastructure where we benefit.\n\n---\n\nAnd then, Frank, just on the OpenStack contribution. I know you take a part of that in terms of services because you've bulked up your services and your professional services capabilities around OpenStack, and then you also have the subscription business. Can give us any sense as to how much OpenStack is contributing to between the 2? Is it 50-50? Or could you help us understand sort of the rough sort of contribution allocation between subscription and service?\n\n---\n\nI would say at this point, 50-50 is probably the best guesstimate that I would give, right, between the subscription side versus the services. But you that will change over time. One last thing I just want to bring up separate from that because it wasn't asked. Just so it's out there. The DSO number that we had for the second quarter FX adjusted was 58 days, and that compares to 60 days of Q2 last year. So just in case there's any questions on that, I thought I'd just put it out there.\n\n---\n\nGreat. I'm afraid that's all the time we have left. We look forward to seeing to everyone later on. And if you have any questions, please let us know. Thank you, operator.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Mark Murphy (Analysts)】\nJim, I wanted to ask you going back to the Red Hat Summit, you had commented that you were supply constrained in your OpenStack business. Since then, you have launched RHEL OSP 7 and I believe the installer has been materially improved. So I'm just wondering, in general, could you comment on the progress in making OpenStack more consumable? And maybe what would be your best estimate of how long it would take to enable real mainstream consumability for OpenStack?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nWell, it certainly made a big leap forward with OSP 7 because we have an installer. We -- it does a really good job of kind of identifying hardware and lighting it up. Of course, that means there's a lot of work to do around certifying that hardware, making sure it lights up appropriately, et cetera, et cetera. So our customers who have been using it have generally been thrilled. We've had some specific-hardware platforms we've been a little challenged on, so we've been kind of working through those components. And obviously, that eats up some professional services resources. But in general, it's allowed us to have a couple of big wins. One of the very large global telcos chose RHEL OSP, a very, very large financial services institution again chose RHEL OSP both this quarter. I think a lot of it was due to the progress that we've made. Mark, there are really 2 pieces around, I think, getting it truly in mainstream, running production applications. One is continuing to make it simpler. And I think we made a big step forward and we'll continue to do that. The other is some more high-availability features, right? So one of the, I think, issues or features with OpenStack is its scalability. But it's basically kind of assuming applications that are stateless. And so continue to build more high-availability features and to allow it to run traditional application is something we've been talking a lot to customers about. So I think there's a general belief that OpenStack is going to be a kind of low-cost platform of choice with customers going forward. But there's a sense that \"Hey, Red Hat, you need to help us take some of our existing applications and migrate them onto OpenStack.\" So we're actively working with some customers on that. So hard to say exactly when these technologies go, but we're starting to see a lot more production applications start to move. Again, these are early adopters doing this. So this isn't quite mainstream, but really pleased with the progress we're seeing there.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Calderoni (Executives)】\nYes, and the other thing that helps, too, is just the thousands of engineers that are certified and that continues to grow very rapidly. So that includes -- that expands the amount of adoption from the standpoint of OpenStack overall. So we're excited about that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Murphy (Analysts)】\nAnd Frank, I just had a quick follow-up for you. I was curious, would you be able to provide for us the sequential FX impact to the -- to both of the deferred revenue lines as had been done, I think, in the recent past? And also just to clarify, on the contractors for Q3 and Q4, I think if I'm interpreting that correctly, then we will not see the same kind of increase in the long-term deferreds in the back half of the year. Could you just comment on whether that's accurate?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nMark, one of things we added this quarter is a presentation. And in that presentation, it actually lists the real change to the deferred revenue you see on the cash flow statement. So I think I'd refer you to that specifically to find it.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Calderoni (Executives)】\nIt's in the page, it's under the cash flow statement. You'll see the numbers laid out there by quarter on Page 10 of the document.\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nAnd Mark, I don't -- I mean, let me ask Frank -- I didn't understand your second question around contract duration. First half of the year, it's been kind of more 20 months, and we expect it to kind of go back more towards 21. I didn't understand your question. If anything, that kind of improves billings performance, right?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Calderoni (Executives)】\nWell, the only thing as far as the contract duration, Mark, there's couple of things that we talked about as far as the benefits of this quarter. We saw, of course, an improvement in the cloud business -- the public cloud business. And as you know, that is recorded in arrears. So that's more realtime business, not necessarily deferred business. So that's going to affect the overall mix of contract. The other thing, too, is we had strength in the government business, which is also another good sign, another quarter of very good strength in our government business. And the government business tends to be a 12-month business. So those 2 elements have a higher percentage of the mix that's going to kind of put a little bit of pressure on the contract -- on the average contract length. So not necessarily anything to be concerned about, it's just a matter of the mix of the business. But as Jim mentioned, what we expect is in the back half of the year, to see it more towards the historic average of 21 months.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Keith Weiss (Analysts)】\nMaybe to follow on, on the cloud question. Two questions there. One, can you give us some kind of indications on sort of the type of business that you're seeing going into these public cloud environments in particular. I think historically, you guys have talked about it being mostly net new workloads. Are you seeing any shifting of workloads into these public cloud environments? And then the second question, maybe for Frank, it sounds like cloud outperformed your expectations this quarter. Is there any way to sort of quantify or what that -- if it wasn't cloud what that impact to billings might have been this quarter or how we could think about more maybe a normalized number on the billing side?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nYes. So I'll start. I mean, again, the Certified Cloud Provider program revenue that we talk about is basically people going to public clouds and buying RHEL, right? So that is typically net new customers because if you have an existing relationship, we have a vehicle for you to purchase and run your subscriptions, whether it's on-premise or on RHEL, right? So those are generally net new workloads and net new customers. One of the very, very large public cloud providers collect that data would they ask, \"Are you a Red Hat customer?\" and the vast majority is new to us. We see some customers taking advantage of being able to run RHEL on public clouds. But recognize, and this is -- more and more seems to be settling out, as I talked to our large customers, for dev and test or for applications that are bearing a lot workloads where elasticity is important. Public cloud has a lot of benefit. But once workload has been up and running, and it is kind of -- it reach kind of a stable, predictable amount, a lot of our large customers or data centers prefer to run those in their data centers. So we're not seeing a lot of people saying, \"Hey, I'm taking an existing application and moving it into the cloud.\" It's more new workloads are being built to run either permanently or often temporarily in the cloud. And so they settle down the performance characteristics and the intention is moving it back in. So it's hard to -- because people are thinking applications essentially running across, it's hard to directly answer that question. So that's one of the piece of benefits that we provide, right? Your right to -- our infrastructure, you can run on public cloud or in your own data center.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Calderoni (Executives)】\nAnd so what we're going to be selling to new customers is kind of provides support for those new workloads. And as you probably know, we have 80 Red Hat-certified public cloud providers on a global basis. So that allows us a good channel to be able to take advantage of that opportunity. And he wanted a question about...\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nOh, workload. Normalizing...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Calderoni (Executives)】\nYes, so if you look at the cloud business, so let's say it's $100 million run rate. So give it about $25 million on a quarterly basis. It's kind of realtime business so the impact that you would see to, let's say, billings, could be approximately $20 million.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Raimo Lenschow (Analysts)】\nThe question I had is more for Jim. Jim, if you look in the OpenStack conversations you have with clients, what's the kind of discussion you have with them? Are they kind of looking at open source and then you just provide a vendor there? Or is it kind of like VMware, Microsoft or maybe Microsoft and then you guys? How does that work at the moment? Is it like -- so the first decision is to go open source, open and with you or is it kind of very much like between the proprietary guys and you guys?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nWell, I guess, 2 things. One is, I think, it's typically OpenStack and then we have to explain why OpenStack, so that decision is made first. But I want to be clear, it's rarely a single decision. Virtually, anyone is going to have a Microsoft environment in their infrastructure. And so they're obviously thinking about whether that's going to be on a Microsoft infrastructure or on VMware and -- or Azure, et cetera, et cetera. Most companies want to then have a separate infrastructure -- so 2 different infrastructures, right? So you want to have a proprietary and an open, so you can get into how big those things are going to be. But there's always going to be a Microsoft footprint there. I think that generally benefit us because, frankly, a lot of -- customers will say, I'm going to have a Microsoft footprint, but I want to have my second one be VMware because there's -- that gives me 2 different proprietary ones and does that necessarily help me in the long run. So I do think we're benefiting from the fact that the alternative to Microsoft, I think, more and more people are thinking open as they're think about their next generation. And so we -- and we obviously do well there. And then it comes down to really with, especially the early adopters, we do get a lot of am I going to buy Red Hat OpenStack now or later? I think most kind of see us as we'll be the Red Hat of OpenStack. And the question is do they want to consume something closer to the trunk or are they ready to stabilize now? So the big telco I mentioned started off with we call it a snowflake, so they started off working with a primarily professional services firm, doing work on OpenStack where they've added in some of their own features. After a couple of RHEVs realized that, that was going to be hard to maintain long term and came to us. So I think, again, we have a good value story once it's OpenStack. And there's a natural sense that OpenStack is going to be at least one of the 2 platforms that most enterprises are looking at deploying.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Brent Thill (Analysts)】\nFrank, there were a few questions from investors regarding the first half of billings number. I know there are a number of moving pieces. But I was curious if you could just maybe provide a little more color related around -- it looked weak as it relates to FX adjusted and as reported. We're want wondering -- maybe understand the deferred is growing nicely, just what your puts and takes were there.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Calderoni (Executives)】\nSure. Sure. That would -- Brent, I'd definitely do that. So I know a lot of it has to do with -- and I'm just kind of looking at the last couple of quarters, about some of what, let's say, the expectation is. So upfront, I just want to mention as everyone knows, we do not provide any forecast on billings because it's difficult to kind of forecast. And one of the things I looked at over the last week or so, if you look at some of the range of what the estimates were, it's about a $30-plus million range between the high and the low. But if we've -- and we've done a lot of analysis on the billings, at least I have, in the last few weeks. And looking at them, I'm really pretty proud of the stats that we have this quarter. One of the things from a billings perspective, just to kind of go through it, so billings proxy, as we look at it, will be the revenue and the change in deferred. So for the quarter, we had about $479 million. So that's up 9% in dollars and 17% in constant currency. And that's fairly consistent when you look at the performance we had in the last Q2, right, from the standpoint of a modest increase year-on-year. I mentioned earlier about the contract duration for the first half. So it was about 20 months. So slightly below the historic level of the 21 months, and we talked about that, and the strength of that was -- what caused that was more related to the public cloud and the government business. And we're expecting it to kind of move back into the 21 months. But if you look underneath the billings, the short-term billings, which we think is probably a better gauge when you take into consideration the points I mentioned about the contract duration, which looked at it over a 12-month period, in Q2, the billings were about $484 million. And that was up about 13% in dollars and 21% in constant currency. And then another view, and I know I'm throwing a lot of numbers out there, but just this is part of the analysis I looked at, so looking at short-term billings but also looking at what we think is probably a better trend view of the business when you're looking at billings, is to look at a rolling average 4-quarter billings proxy, which is revenue plus the change in deferred on a cash flow statement over the 4 quarters. And the importance of this is that it deals with the seasonality of our business, especially when you kind of look at the back half of the year. It also takes in consideration some of the variations that we have in currency. And if you look at it as of the end of Q2, that number was $539 million. That was up 16% year-on-year in dollars and it was up 22% year-on-year in constant currency. So -- and if I look back at what that rolling average was for the last 4, 5 quarters, it was about 20% or higher with the current number being at 22% at the highest number. So again, I think it's a good indication of how it's trending along with what we're seeing from a revenue standpoint. So again, as I said, we're pretty proud of how that's working out.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Turits (Analysts)】\nThat was a very helpful explanation, Frank. So I just wanted to check at that point. So at this point, we should then, again, expect that we should see a little bit more flow-through, I would assume, in the next couple of quarters into cash flow. And I'm sorry to be a little bit vague about this here. But anyway, so that's good. I appreciate that. Just one other question. So I guess it's more for Jim on OpenStack. Can you be a little bit more specific about your competition versus Mirantis, Canonical perhaps and HP and how that's going?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nYes. Well, we feel, I think, very good and certainly encouraged versus even kind of a year ago. We frankly don't see a lot of head-to-head against HP. We do see Mirantis more. We've had several wins or people who were moving away from Mirantis to RHEL. Our value proposition very much is a -- we lock down. We build a certification kind of infrastructure. Everything will work with a defined light, which as OpenStack continues to mature, becomes even more valuable. And so Mirantis has done some good work for customers, but often, that is starting off with a code base but then tailoring it and modifying it to a customer's needs. And that feels good in the short run. But again, RHEV, OpenStack forward and you have a whole patch set. You're trying to RHEV forward because it's not pushed upstream, customers, frankly, get frustrated. And so we have seen migrations as customers have said, \"Oh, no, now I'm either stuck on an old one or I got to migrate this patch set. Maybe it is time to standardize on a company that drives [ph] everything upstream first,\" which is obviously what we've been talking about for a long time. And so I do think that's starting to -- even customers who were initially skeptical of that, who are now kind of going through that pain, are starting to come back to us. So I feel good about the competition and the way that's going. I think you mentioned that only 3 companies we see. Nothing is -- Canonical, we rarely -- I have yet to see a case where we've competed with them. I think it is Mirantis and HP. And again, HP must be in more of their kind of own kind of heavily dominant HP hardware customers because we certainly don't see them playing in places where there are other hardware platforms, which is the majority of what I think of as the large customers out there. So again, I think as any technology matures more, our value proposition only gets stronger. So again, I think we're starting to see some things that, frankly, we have lost a year or 2 ago starting to come back our way.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sitikantha Panigrahi (Analysts)】\nJust looking at your app dev and emerging segment, that's a solid growth, 48% constant currency growth. But that all seems to [indiscernible] your products, your middleware, storage and cloud front. So many different products. Just wondering if you could give some color in terms of any strength you see in any particular product in this quarter or any kind of trend that you're seeing.\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nYes. We don't break out details there. What I would tell you is there are 2 legs to what I think of is that Red Hat growth kind of momentum. One is we still have a significant amount of share take from established vendors. So if you look especially across the JBoss portfolio, we like to talk about the mobile and some of the newer technologies, and there are certainly drivers. But WebSphere to WebLogic. ILog into the JBoss portfolio. A lot of these kind of older, very expensive middleware technologies to JBoss, which is what I think of it is pure commoditization. Our integration technologies, our BPM technologies, all of those are growing quite nicely. I think a lot of that's being driven not necessarily by kind of new cloud-type workloads. Those are just vendor management. We can come in with equivalent solutions that dramatically lower cost. And so that's driving -- so there's that still -- in the same way, UNIX to Linux and Windows to Linux continues to happen. There's a lot happening, especially in the middleware portfolio as customers are still starting to see Red Hat as a long-term enterprise partner. They're starting to move the middleware stacks that way. Now then obviously, the second pillar is as enterprises are building new infrastructure and building applications for that next-generation scale-out infrastructure, we win a chunk there. So those are the 2 main themes. We don't break out the numbers around it. But -- and I know we talk a lot on the cloud theme, but I don't want to forget the theme of we're continuing to take significant share in the traditional data center, which is still the vast majority of the dollars that are spent on IT broadly. And it also will allow us to pivot well. In down markets, we talk about value, value, value. In up markets, we talk about innovation. And we're credible at both of those stories.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Calderoni (Executives)】\nAs we talked about, I mean, the cross-selling is important, 65% this past quarter. Just some stats on some of the transactions. We talked about the top 30 deals. But looking at some of the top 30 deals with some of the emerging products, we had 4 in OpenStack; we had 2 in OpenShift; 5 in Storage. So Storage really saw an uptick this quarter. The other thing is when you -- Jim was talking about the middleware. We had 5 transactions with Fuse, right, which we haven't seen in a while. So those are all good indications of some of the traction that we're getting with our customers. And then also, last week, we had a customer advisory board where we bring together our customers on an annual basis, CIOs, and we were talking about mostly the emerging products. And it was great for me, first experience I've had, to be able to listen in and see how enthusiastic they were about some of the investments that they're making or that they plan to make.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Steven Ashley (Analysts)】\nJim, I wanted to touch on OpenShift. And I know that in the market, there was some discussion about 2 points. Number one, that the early adoption of containers is happening really almost exclusively within just RHEV 2.0 companies and that we weren't seeing broader adoption in commercial. And I was wondering -- my first question for you, perhaps, I don't know. Secondly, people had raised questions about security, not knowing what's in the container and maybe suggesting that running those [ph] containers as VMs is a more secure option. Wondering if you have comments on both of those points.\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nSure, yes. Let me start off saying we just had our Strategic Advisory Board but I also go out and see a lot of customers' containers and thinking about how to consume and manage containers is the single biggest topic that comes up among what I think of as leading -- technology leading. So financial services, technology and telco customers, without a doubt, more than, frankly, I even hear about OpenStack. And it's -- so certainly, certainly far beyond web companies. One kind of public example is Amadeus is building their kind of new platform for their new workloads around OpenShift 3. And their desire is for all their new workloads to be running -- dockerizing containers on OpenShift v3. So it is something -- and what you actually hear, even the infrastructure people at financial services institutions, I was talking to one week ago, 1.5 weeks ago, and he was basically saying I don't have a choice because my developers are delivering containers. And I'm going to have to be able to manage them and so Red Hat run as fast as you can because it's not just about taking the container. As you said, it's about security. It's about management, all the telemetry you need to understand performance bottlenecks and all of that kind of work that still is being done. And so the Atomic platform that we talked about is something a lot of customers are interested in. Literally every industry all walks, again, not because the infrastructure people necessarily want it because -- but the developers are picking it up because it's so much more productive for developers. So the interesting thing about containers, I want to emphasize this over and over, is you can build a story around efficiency of running your infrastructure. That is not what's driving this. Developer efficiency is what is driving this. And literally, I had a CIO tell me I've lost control, really. Developers are going to do this. We have to make sure that we can consume these. On your security point, there are several issues around security. The point you made about what's in the container is critically important. And virtualization does nothing to help you with that, right? You got to recognize that what's in the container is basically the user space side of the operating system. We did an analysis where we wrote a Hello World app in 4 different languages and looked back what packages would need to be subsumed into each of those, and we did like Java, node, so JavaScript. We did PHP. And we looked back over the last year how many security updates had been made that would affect those containers. And depending on the language, it varies from 30 to 50 in the last year. So understanding what's in the container and understanding how you can push updates into that is critical. Obviously, it's an operating system vendor. Our ability to do that, we believe, is far superior to anyone else because we obviously track these packages and know kind of what, when and how security updates need to be pushed. So we actually think that's -- as a commercial vendor, that is a very, very good thing for us because that allows us to kind of tell a security story. Now you are right. There's a separate set of security, which does come around bare metal versus virtualize, which is around certain name spaces, ability to get to certain I/O, filesystems and making sure those are separate. We -- there's 2 parallels paths there. One is to run it virtualized because we've hit a lot of that virtualization, and certainly, many of our customers are running OpenShift on OpenStack as a way to resolve that, or you can run it on VMware as well. At the same time, obviously, the Linux community is driving towards bare metal solutions to that same set of problems as we continue to push that forward. If you look at RHEL 7.2, there are several kind of steps forward in the technology around security around containers. So yes, security is an issue. To some extent, that's a good thing for Red Hat in that allows us to shine with what we do, both in terms of manageability and security updating, et cetera, et cetera. Sorry, that's a long answer, but it's a subtle but important point.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Heather Bellini (Analysts)】\nI just had one housekeeping one and then a follow-up. The first one was just regarding contract duration. I know you said it was 20 months for the first half. But did you specifically say it was also 20 months for the fiscal second quarter? And then, Jim, I just wanted to follow up with you. I mean, you've had a lot of great enhancements with version 7 of your OpenStack platform. I'm just wondering. Obviously, you said you've seen you're running it internally. You've seen some kind of early customers run with it. When do you think we start seeing this as a meaningful contributor to billings? And I'm just wondering if this is something that you'll ultimately be sharing with us kind of an update on similar to your public cloud milestone that you announced this quarter.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Calderoni (Executives)】\nSo Heather, the contract duration in Q1 and Q2 was both 20.\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nIn terms of OpenStack, again, we are still with what I would say the earlier adopters running OpenStack. And some of the deals are quite large because they're large implementations, but they are very lumpy as well. The total dollars is not of a size like the public cloud revenues. So until it's a little bit more of a business that is a little more stable, has a little more visibility, it really wouldn't be appropriate to share that. In terms of your question around when is it going to be a material chunk of revenue, we're -- hard to say. It's starting to pick up. But we're still a little bit of a ways away before it's kind of what I would say truly material contributor.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Calderoni (Executives)】\n$2 billion.\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nYes, $2 billion of revenue.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Karl Keirstead (Analysts)】\nI wanted to return to the cloud mix. The move from $36 million run rate to $100 million run rate in 6 quarters is pretty impressive. And I've got 2 questions. One is I know that comes from 80 certified public cloud providers. But could you offer a little color on which specific public cloud infrastructures are driving the bulk of that growth? I presume it's AWS, but I'd love to hear your commentary. And secondly, maybe this is for Frank. Frank, as more of your bookings come from this avenue, could you remind us what the impact is on profitability and operating cash flow as the mix slowly shifts to the cloud?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nI'll start on the breakdown, and then Frank can get into impacts around some of the profitability. It is obviously highly skewed to one very large private -- or public could provider as you can imagine, very large share overall. And I think our share reflects that as well. I don't think we're skewed otherwise relative to their share, but there is one cloud provider that's kind of well ahead of the others that I think you all know. Beyond that, there are a few, what I'll say, a collection of 7 or 8 cloud providers, I would say, are more enterprise-focused. You can kind of imagine kind of who a couple of those are, who target -- these are enterprise names that target enterprise. Those we have much larger than, I would say, kind of our normal share. And then there's a long tail of others out there that just kind of spreads out. So we do well on that true enterprise-focused ones and then AWS is large cloud provider of the West Coast. So I don't know, probably the top 10 represents 90% of the business, 85%. I don't have the numbers exactly front of me.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Calderoni (Executives)】\nAs far as the profitability, we don't necessarily break out segments of the business and look at the individual P&Ls. But I will tell you, just on what I've learned in the last couple of months here, and this is part of our subscription business, I would not think it would be materially different, the profitability of the cloud business versus the rest. Because if I look at the overall margins, the subscription business has been pretty much in line with that 94%. And even as the number has been growing, it really hasn't had any material impact on the overall margins. So I'm pretty comfortable that's probably consistent.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Karl Keirstead (Analysts)】\nAnd on the cash flow?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nWell, it hurts cash flow. It hurts cash flow because again, people are paying as they go versus upfront. So it would be -- if we weren't growing, it wouldn't matter. But because of our growth rate, it's certainly kind of in the short run, in the ramp phase, it reduces billings and cash flow a bit.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Calderoni (Executives)】\nVersus if we would do it otherwise.\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nRight, just because we're charging as we go versus charging a year upfront.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Calderoni (Executives)】\nRight, right.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Karl Keirstead (Analysts)】\nGot it. Very helpful and obviously the fact that you put up great operating cash flow and have held subscription gross margins attests to the strength of the business despite that impact to the cloud.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kash Rangan (Analysts)】\nOkay. Wonderful. Jim, I'm not going to let you off the hook. Because we have a spent a material amount of time discussing OpenStack, I want to hear you, if not revenue, I'm not asking for revenue, but could you give us some feel for the number of instances that have gone live, number of service [ph] that have gone live or a number of instances sold, divided by a number of instances in production or number of logos that have bought the product, some feel for some early indicator? And one for you, Frank, given your experience at Cisco, what are the things that you see at Red Hat that are opportunities?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nI don't know if I have any good number that I could share around that. I mean, we have hundreds of POCs working their way through various parts of the system. So it's certainly hundreds, and I would say most major names that you can imagine are in some level of trial around it. I don't have a good number other than something kind of in the hundreds at some point in the sales cycle, not just, I mean, like POC all the way through. So again, it's going really nicely from our perspective. But in terms of out the other side, a lot of production running, we -- I just don't have a set of numbers. We don't quite track it that way to be able to give you a sense. I'll try to do better with some more numbers on that side next quarter.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kash Rangan (Analysts)】\nMaybe for Christmas present.\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nThere you go.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Calderoni (Executives)】\nAs far as your question as far as the opportunity, I mean, I think I mentioned this at the Summit when we had the analyst meeting. And I can really say this again now having been a part of Red Hat for 3 months and also looking at it when I was at Cisco. The key thing I see here is just the opportunity for further growth. I heard it -- as I mentioned before last week with some of the customers that we had at the customer advisory board, I see it whether it's in -- we're talking a lot today about OpenStack and OpenShift. We talk about our Storage business. We look at middleware. And you look at where CIOs and companies are going to be making their investment. I think we have a huge opportunity from that perspective. And the key thing for us is going to be able to scale to meet that opportunity, and that's really where I hope to play a key role.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matthew Hedberg (Analysts)】\nI have a question for Jim. Jim, Microsoft made some comments, I believe it was last week, about Linux. I think they're calling it as Azure Cloud Switch. I'm curious to get your thoughts on that. And I know we talked in the past about the public cloud business, and the big one you seem to be missing is Azure. I'm curious, what are some of the things in terms of the thinking about potentially running RHEL and Azure at some point?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nWell look, we want to serve our customers' needs, right, flat out. So with customer demand, we will work to be where our customers want to be. It's hard for me to talk about a specific provider. We have over 100. We just recently added VMware, vCloud Air. So you can imagine Microsoft and the history around it that's a different beast, but I hope we can -- well, we expect to and will have our platform running anywhere our customers want to run it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matthew Hedberg (Analysts)】\nAnd what about -- I just wondering about some of the stuff they talked about last week with Cloud Switch. Maybe you can talk about them and Linux.\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nWell, I mean, I think that there's -- I think they figured out there's a lot of amazing technology that's out in the open, driven by user-driven innovation and some of that they need to consume themselves. And so I think they're certainly much more pragmatic around open source than perhaps they were a couple of years ago. And I think this is a prime example where there's a set of things they need around Azure, and it's kind of already kind of best provided in open stores. And so I'm actually very encouraged with -- by Satya and his stance around open source.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Walter Pritchard (Analysts)】\nI guess first for Jim, just a question on the Windows market. And I'd say you appear to be gaining some share pretty consistently against Windows. Are there any workloads you could point to that you think maybe recently have helped you really accelerate some of those gains that looks like you're having?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nWell, 2 things. First off, Big Data, right? I mean, Big Data has a natural affinity to Linux because of Hadoop and all of those things that originally were written and are kind of native on Linux. But the big one is just all of these new kind of -- whether it's, call it, systems of engagement or Mode 2 in general, which are the scale-out infrastructure type of workloads. Those are -- I don't want to say exclusively on an open platform, but the vast majority are in an open platform. So again, as people are thinking about their next generation, whether it's a mobile workload, as they think about whatever that next kind of cloud or web-type workload, it's highly, highly likely that, that's going to go on Linux, not on Windows. And obviously, for enterprise customers, that's very highly likely that it's going to be the Red Hat stack. So that's why obviously, we're working hard around containers, around OpenStack. This is a natural affinity to the rest of our product suite in that as customers think about mobile and most of the mobile things out there are happening in languages, frameworks, et cetera, and open, they're already moving towards open, probably going to run that on open source infrastructure where we benefit.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Brent Thill (Analysts)】\nAnd then, Frank, just on the OpenStack contribution. I know you take a part of that in terms of services because you've bulked up your services and your professional services capabilities around OpenStack, and then you also have the subscription business. Can give us any sense as to how much OpenStack is contributing to between the 2? Is it 50-50? Or could you help us understand sort of the rough sort of contribution allocation between subscription and service?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Calderoni (Executives)】\nI would say at this point, 50-50 is probably the best guesstimate that I would give, right, between the subscription side versus the services. But you that will change over time. One last thing I just want to bring up separate from that because it wasn't asked. Just so it's out there. The DSO number that we had for the second quarter FX adjusted was 58 days, and that compares to 60 days of Q2 last year. So just in case there's any questions on that, I thought I'd just put it out there.\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nGreat. I'm afraid that's all the time we have left. We look forward to seeing to everyone later on. And if you have any questions, please let us know. Thank you, operator.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you, Laura. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. Both our second quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions]\r\nPlease save the date for our 2015 investor conference, which we will hold at the New York Stock Exchange on October 27. Details will be coming soon, and we hope you can join us.\r\nI will now turn the call over to Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Cindy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's second quarter 2015 results is Mike Schlotman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. And the next time you see Mike, please congratulate him on his well-deserved and well-earned promotion.\r\nWe are pleased with our second quarter results. Our 5.3% identical supermarket sales growth, without fuel, allowed us to continue investing in our business and delivering on our aggressive growth plan. Strong fuel margins toward the end of the quarter allowed us to deliver results that exceeded our original expectations.\r\nDuring the second quarter, we achieved our 47th consecutive quarter of positive identical supermarket sales growth. We exceeded our goal to slightly expand FIFO operating margin, without fuel, on a rolling 4-quarter basis. We kept costs down, which, together with identical supermarket sales growth, allowed Kroger to leverage operating expenses at a rate of sales. And we continue to grow market share by improving our connection with customers, which fuels both our top and bottom lines and enables strategic Customer 1st investments. These consistently remarkable financial results are possible quarter after quarter because our business is built on the belief that serving customers is serving shareholders.\r\nBased on the strength of our second quarter results, we are raising our net earnings per diluted share and identical supermarket sales growth guidance for the year. While customers continue to feel optimistic about the economy throughout the second quarter, they also continue to tell us they want to spend less. More and more, they want retailers to help them save money with sales and coupons. We are well positioned with our everyday low prices and our weekly sales and digital offers to solve this for our customers.\r\nAs you know, the food retail business is in a constant state of change. Part of what makes our Customer 1st Strategy so powerful is it provides Kroger a firm foundation from which to approach new opportunities in the right way to benefit our customers, associates and shareholders. \r\nWhile there are many examples where our business is rapidly evolving, I'd like to highlight 3 key areas of innovation and investment today: technology, food and people, and how the steps we are taking in each of these areas are broadening our competitive advantage for the future.\r\nWe are actively expanding our use of technology in ways we believe will make a difference for customers and associates. This summer, we expanded our online ordering pilot in Cincinnati to 3 additional divisions. We are now offering our \"order online, pick up at the store\" solution in select Kroger stores in Louisville and Indianapolis and Fred Meyer stores in the Portland area. This is, of course, in addition to the Harris Teeter's successful Express Lane service.\r\nWhen you think about digital opportunities, we do not limit our focus to e-commerce. Digital for Kroger includes a broad range of efforts to interact with customers in increasingly relevant and meaningful ways, whether online or through our mobile app. A key metric is our measure of digital and household engagement, and during the second quarter, we continued to gain household engagement at record numbers.\r\nOur Kroger technology team continues to earn recognition for leading-edge initiatives to establish the Internet of Things in our stores. Earlier this summer, Kroger's electronic temperature monitoring project was named a winner of the CIO 100 Award by CIO Magazine. And as we shared with you in June, the talented team at 84.51° is helping us grow and evolve even faster due to their closer daily involvement in our business. 84.51°'s specialty, helping us make data-driven decisions that truly put the customer first, is a significant competitive advantage for Kroger.\r\nOur multitiered Corporate Brands portfolio has always been a powerful differentiator for Kroger. Simple Truth continues to see explosive growth. Private Selection remains a vibrant, billion-dollar brand that is growing in the double digits and developing unique offerings in many categories.\r\nI'm pleased to share with you that later this month, we will launch an entirely new brand called HemisFares. HemisFares brings only the best food finds from around the globe to our food-curious customers for an amazing authentic eating experience. It's a guided tour of the best tastes on the earth. Imagine landing in a country known for its incredible food and experiencing the finest examples of its region's most famous and delectable eats. Every HemisFares product is curated from the source and imported directly to our stores. The most exciting part is that no one else has a brand like this. HemisFares is a great example of what makes our Corporate Brands unique, and we think it will appeal to millennials, foodies and, ultimately, all cuffs of our customers. And by the way, I've tried a lot of the products, and it's outstanding. It's not just great. And I think you're going to love it when you get a chance to try it.\r\nOur reputation for consistently -- consistent execution rests squarely on the shoulders of our 400,000 associates who make it all happen in our stores, distribution centers, manufacturing facilities and offices. Our workforce is expanding rapidly to support our growth strategy. Last year, we created 25,000 new jobs, and right now, we are hiring to fill an estimated 20,000 new and permanent positions in our stores. We are looking for people who want to be part of a team, take pride in everything they do and want to grow with us.\r\nOne important and untapped resource for new associates is our country's military veterans. Since 2009, more than 29,000 veterans have joined our ranks, and hundreds of current associates continue to actively serve in the military. Over the past several years, Kroger has formalized our military hiring initiatives. We joined the 100,000 Jobs Mission, a coalition of companies with the common goal of hiring transitioning service members and military veterans, and we have increased our presence at military recruiting events. \r\nNext week, we are hosting our first ever Honoring Our Heroes hiring event, during which we will hold open interviews at every one of our supermarket locations on Tuesday, September 15, for all veterans and their family members. \r\nThe fact that nearly 70% of our store managers started out as hourly associates or stocking shelves or bagging groceries speaks to Kroger's opportunity culture, which, we believe, is a differentiator for us today and will continue to be so in the future.\r\nBefore I turn it over to Mike, I'd like to comment on our announcement yesterday of a new organizational structure for our senior leadership team. We take a team approach to leadership, and this new structure is designed to better align resources to our company's goals. It also streamlines decision-making and accelerates progress on our growth strategy. \r\nAs I said in our announcement yesterday, Kroger is incredibly fortunate to have such an exceptional strong group of leaders across our company, and our senior leadership team has unmatched depth and experience to continue delivering for our customers, associates and shareholders.\r\nNow Mike Schlotman will offer more detail on Kroger's second quarter results, provide you an update on labor relations and update our guidance for 2015. Mike?\n\n---\n\nThanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. First, I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our results for the quarter in each of the key performance target areas for our long-term growth plan.\r\nOur first metric is identical supermarket sales without fuel. Our identical supermarket sales growth of 5.3% in the second quarter demonstrates the strength of our core business. Our identical supermarket sales growth was driven by a combination of strong tonnage growth and an increase in the number of households shopping with us in the second quarter. \r\nWe also met our goal to grow the number of loyal households at an even faster rate than total household growth during the quarter. All geographies and supermarket departments had positive identical supermarket sales, excluding fuel, during the quarter. \r\nWe continue to see outstanding double-digit identical sales growth in our natural foods department. Our meat, deli and pharmacy departments also posted strong sales. Rolling 4 quarters FIFO operating margin, excluding fuel, the 2014 and 2013 adjustment items and the contributions to the pension and foundation in the third and fourth quarters of 2014, I hope you got all that, increased by 20 basis points. This exceeded our commitment to grow the rate slightly over time on a rolling 4 quarters basis.\r\nReturn on invested capital on a rolling 4 quarters basis was 14.24%. We are not presenting a comparative number this quarter because the last year's second quarter calculation does not include a full year of Harris Teeter assets and results. We continue to expect our return on invested capital for fiscal 2015 to increase slightly from fiscal 2014 results. This is an important metric as we continue to increase our capital investment to drive our future growth.\r\nBefore I share our second quarter results in more detail, I'd like to discuss how we are successfully managing through the current operating environment, which has more volatility than normal, especially as it relates to fuel margins and inflation. We benefited from higher fuel margins late in the second quarter. As Rodney said, our nonfuel results were right in line with where we expected them to be. We expect fuel volatility to continue for the remainder of the year.\r\nAnother factor that we are actively managing is product costs. While inflation continued at a lower rate during the second quarter, which we estimate was approximately 1.4% without fuel, some commodities had high inflation and others had deflation. Seafood and milk were deflationary, produce prices were less deflationary in the quarter, and we continue to see inflation in generic pharmaceuticals. It bears repeating that if you look back over the past several years, we have had periods of high and low inflation, and we've shown that regardless of the environment, we will deliver greater value and convenience for our customers.\r\nNow I'll share our second quarter 2015 results in more detail. As you know, we don't provide guidance for total sales because of the unpredictable impact that fuel has on our overall results. Total sales in the second quarter were impacted by the lower retail price of fuel, much like the first quarter. The average price of retail fuel during our second quarter was $2.67 compared to $3.54 last year.\r\nTotal sales in the second quarter increased 0.9% to $25.5 billion compared to $25.3 billion in the same period last year. Excluding fuel, total sales increased 5.7% for the second quarter compared to the same period last year.\r\nIn the second quarter, our net earnings totaled $433 million or $0.44 per diluted share. Net earnings in the same period last year were $347 million or $0.35 per diluted share.\r\nKroger reported a $21 million LIFO charge during the quarter compared to a $26 million LIFO charge in the same quarter last year. FIFO gross margin, excluding retail fuel operations, decreased 7 basis points from the same period last year.\r\nStrong identical supermarket sales growth and cost controls allowed Kroger to leverage operating expenses as a rate of sales in the second quarter. Total operating expenses, excluding retail fuel operations, decreased 35 basis points as a percent of sales compared to last year. Second quarter FIFO operating profit, excluding fuel, increased approximately $93 million over the prior year.\r\nNow for retail fuel operations. In the second quarter, our cents-per-gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.19 compared to $0.183 in the same quarter last year. We expect fuel margins to continue to be volatile during the second half of the year.\r\nCorporate Brands performance during the second quarter was solid, representing an approximately 26.4% of total units sold and 25.1% of sales dollars, excluding fuel and pharmacy.\r\nI will provide a brief update on labor relations. We recently agreed to new contracts in Columbus and Memphis and have ratified all the local agreements associated with a master agreement with the Teamsters covering several distribution and manufacturing facilities. We are currently negotiating contracts with the UFCW store associates in Denver and Portland and with the Teamsters covering our Southern California distribution centers. \r\nOur objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive cost and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality, affordable health care and a retirement benefit for our associates. Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger and the local unions which represent many of our associates should have a shared objective: growing Kroger's business and profitability, which help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.\r\nOur long-term financial strategy continues to be to repurchase shares, have an increasing dividend, fund increasing capital investments and to maintain our current investment-grade debt rating. Our strong financial position has allowed us to return $1 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends over the last 4 quarters. During the second quarter, Kroger repurchased 1.1 million common shares for a total investment of $43 million. Capital investments, excluding mergers and acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, totaled $812 million for the second quarter compared to $672 million for the same period last year. We expect capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, to be at the high end of the $3 billion to $3.3 billion range for the year. We are turning towards the high end because we see a strong pipeline of high-quality projects, and we continue to be encouraged by the results from our new stores. In order to have a steady flow of projects and increase the total number of store projects, we are spending on stores scheduled to open in 2016 to make sure they are ready to meet our target dates. Additionally, we continue to reduce the amount of time it takes to complete projects.\r\nThe company's net total debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio decreased to 2.02 compared to 2.32 during the same period last year. Kroger's net total debt is $11.3 billion compared to $11.1 billion during the same period last year. \r\nAgain this year -- or again this quarter, we have essentially maintained our absolute debt level while returning $1 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends over the last 4 quarters, investing $3.1 billion in capital on a rolling 4 quarters basis, plus an additional $426 million on mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities. In other words, we are keeping our commitments to our bondholders and shareholders while delivering value to our customers and increasing opportunities for our associates.\r\nNow I'd like to update our growth objectives for 2015. Based on our strong year-to-date performance, we raised our identical supermarket sales growth guidance, excluding fuel, to a range of 4% to 5% for 2015; the prior guidance was 3.5% to 4.5%. We also raised our net earnings per diluted share guidance to a range of $1.92 to $1.98 for fiscal 2015; the previous guidance was $1.90 to $1.95 per diluted share. This range exceeds the company's net earnings per diluted share growth rate guidance of 8% to 11%. Shareholder return will be further enhanced by a dividend expected to increase over time. We continue to expect the third quarter to be at the high end of our long-term growth range and the fourth quarter to be below the range. \r\nOur second quarter results demonstrate that our base business is performing very well. The volatility of fuel in the back half of the year will determine where we end up within that range.\r\nNow I'll return it back to Rodney.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Mike. Kroger's business is strong. Our team of associates continues to drive our Customer 1st strategy by taking care of our customers in big and small ways, offering fresh foods and keeping costs down so that we can reinvest those savings in our associates, store experience, products and prices. As a result, we continue to earn customer loyalty and gain market share. We are investing to grow our business for the future while delivering on our promises today. Our stores are hiring to fill 20,000 new permanent jobs. We are expanding our digital and e-commerce offerings. Our confidence in Kroger has never been stronger.\r\nNow we look forward to your questions.",

In other words, we are keeping our commitments to our bondholders and shareholders while delivering value to our customers and increasing opportunities for our associates.\r\nNow I'd like to update our growth objectives for 2015. Based on our strong year-to-date performance, we raised our identical supermarket sales growth guidance, excluding fuel, to a range of 4% to 5% for 2015; the prior guidance was 3.5% to 4.5%. We also raised our net earnings per diluted share guidance to a range of $1.92 to $1.98 for fiscal 2015; the previous guidance was $1.90 to $1.95 per diluted share. This range exceeds the company's net earnings per diluted share growth rate guidance of 8% to 11%. Shareholder return will be further enhanced by a dividend expected to increase over time. We continue to expect the third quarter to be at the high end of our long-term growth range and the fourth quarter to be below the range. \r\nOur second quarter results demonstrate that our base business is performing very well. The volatility of fuel in the back half of the year will determine where we end up within that range.\r\nNow I'll return it back to Rodney.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nThanks, Mike. Kroger's business is strong. Our team of associates continues to drive our Customer 1st strategy by taking care of our customers in big and small ways, offering fresh foods and keeping costs down so that we can reinvest those savings in our associates, store experience, products and prices. As a result, we continue to earn customer loyalty and gain market share. We are investing to grow our business for the future while delivering on our promises today. Our stores are hiring to fill 20,000 new permanent jobs. We are expanding our digital and e-commerce offerings. Our confidence in Kroger has never been stronger.\r\nNow we look forward to your questions.",
      "transcript_text3": "I just -- I don't want to sound negative here, but I guess, what I'm wondering, in terms of your ID guidance for the year, it definitely reflects a slow-down in the 2-year comp in the third quarter and fourth quarter, even though it looks like inflation is maybe getting a little bit better, maybe less of a headwind. So I guess, any color there. Is this you kind of being conservative? Any color you could give would be helpful.\n\n---\n\nWell, it's -- the guidance is always one of the hardest things to come up with what's the right estimate. As you know, we've always expected inflation to continue to slow down during the year, and we would expect that to continue. Now, we're working hard, as always, to make sure that we're at a good side of that. If you look at where we are so far this quarter, we continue to track within those -- within the guidance and kind of similar to where we were in the second quarter. So we feel good about where we are, but -- and we see exciting opportunities. I don't know, Mike, did you want to...\n\n---\n\nYes, Karen, another thing to keep in mind is if you look at real growth, if you look at our current ID sales trend, and even what we would be projecting, and take away the relatively benign inflationary environment today, it's actually as strong of a real growth as we've had in quite some time, really, going all the way back to 3 or 4 years, actually 4 or 5 years. You really don't see a trend as strong as we have today when you look at it on an inflation-adjusted basis. Our tonnage growth is quite strong. And from our standpoint, as long as we continue to have the tonnage growth in many of the departments that we have, we'll be just fine, because that's the ultimate demonstration of the strength of your business is how many items are the customers buying on a weekly and monthly basis.\n\n---\n\nOkay, and that's helpful. And then, I guess, also just on your guidance, I'm -- just was wondering, on your updated pension guidance, you have some changes in both the company and the multiemployer. It's unclear to me on the multiemployer if your prior guidance just didn't include the $60 million that was previously accrued, but you definitely also increased the company-sponsored. So obviously, you're raising your guidance even with these -- those 2 headwinds?\n\n---\n\nYes. The $60 million would have been accrued and expensed when it was accrued. Keep in mind that on the multiemployer plans, when you have a contractual obligation or actually put dollars in, you expense it, versus a company plan, we could put money in, and it may not translate to an -- a current expense. So they're quite different in how you account for the 2 calculations. I don't -- it's not a dramatic change in our expectations between the 2 plans, although somewhat...\n\n---\n\nMore of a headwind? Okay, I'll get back in the queue.\n\n---\n\nIt would be -- I mean, it would be a slight headwind compared to where we were earlier in the year, but nothing dramatic.\n\n---\n\nSo I wanted to touch on your pharmacy business. We've seen some of your competitors call out some headwinds within their pharmacy business on the margin line. I just want to get a sense of whether you guys are also seeing some headwinds within your pharmacy business as well on the margin line.\n\n---\n\nAs you know, one of the things that's so important for us is our total portfolio of businesses. And when you look, there's almost -- every year, you'll have something stronger and something else weaker. And if you look at the pharmacy business, what we would be experiencing would be pretty similar to what some of our competitors would talk about. We continue to have very strong growth on the number of scripts filled, and that has been true for a long period of time, and our pharmacy teams continue to do a great job on taking care of our customers. But in terms of financial, you -- it would be very similar to what some of the others have talked about. But it is the nice thing and the great thing about having a portfolio of businesses where some pieces are obviously growing well in excess of the total.\n\n---\n\nOkay, great. And then, switching topics to maybe expenses. So the leverage this quarter is much better than what we saw last quarter. Besides sales leverage, was there anything else that may have contributed to the better leverage this period?\n\n---\n\nI think it's really across-the-board good cost controls in many facets of the business. As we often say here at Kroger, sales are a beautiful thing. And when you can have north of 5% IDs, the sale leverage -- sales leverage on the expense line becomes quite enormous. And particularly if your ID sales start to exceed where your own expectations were, it gets a little tough to add hours as fast as the sales start to come, and it takes a while to catch up to that. So there was -- there could have been a bit of that as well. But I wouldn't say there is any one particular area that would stand out. It's really pretty strong across-the-board cost controls for many locations.\n\n---\n\nOne of the other things that we mentioned on the first quarter, we were pretty aggressive on incrementally investing hours in some places. Some of that, you begin to get the flow of it and you understand, where does it make sense and where doesn't it make sense as well.\n\n---\n\nSo, guys, 2 things. Do you think -- when you look at the momentum the business has and the things you have to invest in, have we gotten to a point where it's really hard to keep ex fuel EBIT margin to just up slightly, right, without making investments that you don't think have a return? Or you think -- do you think we're just in a period here where timing of investments had been slower, and that's partly why you're getting the 20 basis points?\n\n---\n\nI -- when you look at the business overall, I would still feel that slightly improving is where -- is the right thing, long term, for the business and what creates the most sustainable long-term value for the business, and obviously, then, flow through to our shareholders. It's never as easy to be exactly precise every quarter in terms of where you invest and how do the margins flow through. So I feel good about where we are, but I certainly don't believe, as I look forward, to cause us to do anything to adjust what we -- the guidance we've provided. I don't know, Mike, any additional insight?\n\n---\n\nYes, and one of the things to keep in mind, John, is we -- as you know, we have a portfolio of things we want to invest in over time. And these aren't promotional activities. To your point, we aren't going to go out and have crazy promotional activity that's not going to be sustainable and drive long-term growth. But we have a portfolio of things we want to continue to invest in. And frankly, some of the strength we're experiencing today is on the backs of some of the investments we made in the third and fourth quarter of last year. And you make a little bit of an investment, and then, several months later, you start to see the fruits of that investment. And that's one of the things that's leading to the strong IDs we've had in the first half. And we've tried to get into this rhythm where we're more diligent about when we invest, how we invest, balanced up against consistent results. And I think we're doing as good a job as we've ever done, and we still have that portfolio of areas where we would like to invest in.\n\n---\n\nAnd then, Rodney, you talked about the organizational structure, which is quite different than you've had as far back as I can remember. And you said sort of right for this time. Maybe more specifically, what do you think this structure gives you benefit-wise? And then, it does sound like every -- a lot of the guys will have more direct reports than they did before. What do you have to do, if anything, different in how you run the business tactically to account for that, that people would be overseeing more than they had previously?\n\n---\n\nWell, a big part of that is just the growth that the team has had. I feel very comfortable that the growth they've had as leaders will allow them to have a little broader span of control than they've had before. As you know, we're incredibly fortunate to have such a great depth of people, and we're incredibly fortunate that they've been at Kroger for a long time. So they really know our business well and they understand what we're trying to get done. For me, it really does eliminate one layer of decision-making, and it really does streamline this -- our ability to make decisions. And the team is working together so well as a team, and I'm just really excited about -- going forward, I think it'll just make it a lot smoother in terms of how the -- how we operate on a day-to-day basis.\n\n---\n\nIt's actually Ed Kelly here asking a question for Stephanie. So I guess, my first question for you -- well, my one question...\n\n---\n\nYour one question. Very good.\n\n---\n\nI have a follow-up. But so just related to IDs. I mean, your IDs are clearly exceeding expectations. You're raising the full-year guidance for the ID again this quarter. I would guess that the level of inflation is less than what you probably thought coming into the year. And Mike, you talked about it with tonnage, right, being the strongest that it's kind of been in some time. Could you just maybe help us understand how you're driving such strong growth in the business? And maybe even what's surprising you as you look at the top line performance today.\n\n---\n\nThe -- it's a great question. And to me, the thing that is so important about what Kroger has been doing for a long period of time, not just in this quarter, is really focusing on multiple aspects of connecting with our customers and associates. So it's really -- we continue to improve the products that our customers have. We -- our merchandisers continue to find new ideas and new products. Our operators continue to improve execution and figuring out ways to take cost out of the business, and we continue to take that and invest in what the customers tell us is important. So it's really all of those things working together. The thing that you never know is how do -- how will competitors react to what you're doing and how -- customers continually change and how do you make sure that you're staying out in front of those changes. So far this year, we're incredibly delighted with how we've identified how the customer's evolving and changing and connecting with those customers in a deeper and deeper way. Our customers tell us, from the way that our associates serve them, the products we deliver, the prices, that we've continued to improve what we're doing, and it's really the combination of all those things working together.\n\n---\n\nMaybe just a quick follow-up here on inflation. I think I heard you guys say that you continue to expect inflation to slow throughout the rest of the year. We have, I think, heard from one of your smaller competitors yesterday about particularly produce and maybe produce bottoming and getting better. So could you just maybe provide a little color on some of the categories and how you see that progressing throughout the rest of the year?\n\n---\n\nYes, Ed, as I said in my prepared comments, the produce picture, actually, the deflation slowed. And actually, if you were to look at the very end of the quarter, there was a slight bit of inflation in the last several weeks. Nothing to write home about, but it was deflationary for the quarter but got less, and actually turned a bit towards the end of the quarter. You continue to see other categories out there that have a mixed bag. Grocery is still, let's call it, just north of flat, just a little bit of inflation, and that's a big driving factor in it. The other one to keep out -- to keep in mind, as you think about inflation, is pharmacy is a big inflationary area that I spoke of as well. The generic costs continue to go up. It's -- on the earlier question on the headwinds from gross margin in pharmacy, it's one of the reasons why that headwind exists, because you can't pass that on as quickly as the cost of the underlying pills go up. So it continues to be a mixed bag. You're seeing some of the meat complex get less inflationary and, in fact, deflationary in some areas, but still some slight inflation in other areas. Seafood is a little deflationary right now, but it continues to be a little bit all over the board.\n\n---\n\nWanted to ask on the digital initiatives. You guys had said that a few more divisions now have the pick-up-at-store capabilities. Can you give us a little bit more color as to what you're seeing in terms of traction, usage there? What may be in the basket, and then maybe kind of some thoughts going forward for further rollout?\n\n---\n\nWell, the -- I -- to give you some insights, the -- it's -- what we find is some customers enjoy shopping that and -- in addition to still buying stuff in the store. So it's -- and you've heard us talk a long time about, on digital, we really do believe it's an and, and not an or. And all it is, is trying to offer one more way of a customer engaging with us so that they get engaged with us the way they want to versus the way they have to. And what we find is the customer feedback has been very positive for some customers, but it's not all customers. And the learnings that we were able to get from Harris Teeter is they really were able to accelerate teaching us how to do it, and then, our store associates are doing a great job of executing against that. In terms of specifics on going forward, the only thing, really, I would say is it continues to be something that we test, and will kind of -- the pace of which we go will really be driven by how fast the customers engage with us. And one of the things that we're trying to do as a company is pace things based on our ability to execute against it and the customer's connection with it. So I wouldn't be able to give you specifics right now because we really don't have specifics yet.\n\n---\n\nOkay. No, that is helpful. And maybe just as a follow-up, I'll stick with the digital initiatives. And I know you guys have said you're continuing to see some really nice growth in the loyal households. Have there been any changes on your end since the exclusivity with what was dunnhumby over the past couple of quarters has changed? Has there been any change in your approach to getting to know those loyal customers and who you -- who else maybe you are working with or not going forward?\n\n---\n\nThe -- I wouldn't say there's been change. The thing that's probably the biggest difference is the leadership team at 84.51° is involved in every meeting now. And it's things when you're trying to make a decision on what you do, the folks are around the table, and they have great insights, so you're really having those insights as part of the decision at the front end rather than at the back end of the conversation. So the biggest thing is just the quality. To say that we get additional insights, I wouldn't say there's additional insight so far. I would say there's a lot of additional projects that we're working on that should help us going forward. That, I feel very confident in, that it just makes it a lot easier to get those things done rather than having to negotiate with a third party.\n\n---\n\nThere's been so much change in Southern California amongst some of your larger peers. And I realize it's not easy, maybe it's impossible to quantify, but can you give us a sense for how much those changes have either benefited you or created a more challenging competitive environment? Just thinking about some of the issues that Haggen has had, some of the changes that Albertsons put into place. If you can address that at all, I'd be appreciative.\n\n---\n\nYes, the -- it's one of those where, obviously, it's a good question but hard to answer. When you look at our business in total in Southern California, we're very happy with where we are. But the thing -- the biggest thing that we think is driving it is our associates are doing a great job, and our leadership team there, in terms of improving how we serve our customers. Now whether it's things customers do -- or our competitors are doing that causes our customers to like what we're doing better, that I don't know. I think it's always important to remember that in Southern California, Costco is actually one of our biggest competitors. Whole Foods would be a huge competitor there. You have a ton of really high-quality independents there. So the competition there is very diverse and more than just the Safeway and Albertsons and their merger and  Haggen. So I really -- it's hard to say a certain part is because of whatever somebody is doing. And we're really much more focused on how are the customers telling us we're delivering against what they're asking for. Mike, anything you would want to add to that?\n\n---\n\nNo, I agree. It's -- when there's any kind of disruption in a market, we look at it as an opportunity from a positive standpoint, not a woe-is-me, oh, what's going to happen, how are we going to deal with this. And when you -- when names change on banners, when people may go to market differently, the opportunity all exists that folks may look for a different place to shop that didn't do that in the past, and we want to make sure that Dawn [ph] and her team continue to do what they're doing to excite our customers and our associates in Southern California.\n\n---\n\nAnd then, my follow-up, I just wanted to confirm that I heard correctly. You did say, I think, 3Q QTD ID sales, ex fuel, similar to what we saw in 2Q, right? [indiscernible]\n\n---\n\n[indiscernible] What I said is quarter-to-date, it's pretty similar to where we are in quarter 2.\n\n---\n\nSo I had a question on Simple Truth. I think it's in some of your convenience stores now. I was just wondering how the brand's performing in that channel and how many C-stores it is in, I guess.\n\n---\n\nI'm looking...\n\n---\n\nI've had C-stores for 2 days, and I already got it in there. Honestly, I don't know the answer to that question. How many it's in or how broad the...\n\n---\n\nYes, on a few select items, it's in -- pretty broad in a lot of our convenience stores, but it's pretty narrow. It's early in the process, and we're really trying to learn how broad can the brand go and who all connects with it. As you know, historically, convenience stores isn't a place you go to for healthy offerings. And we are trying to make sure that the customer, if that's what they want, they can find what they want. So it's early in the process, but we are trying to learn how far the Simple Truth brand can go.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then, on, I guess, the M&A opportunity environment. We saw repurchases come down in the quarter, leverage is back to about where it was pre-Harris Teeter. How are you feeling about the M&A environment or opportunities in the -- out there?\n\n---\n\nI would say our M&A appetite is the same as it's always been when the -- if the right opportunity comes along and it's the right set of stores, right sets of assets and right management team, we would think about it. There's not a lot that happens in the space that doesn't come across our desk. I wouldn't read anything into the share buyback coming down in the quarter to signal something on M&A activity. We were pretty upfront that we expected to front-end load our share repurchase program. And really, what you're seeing in the second quarter is the use of stock option proceeds and the tax benefit from that to repurchase shares to offset that dilution. And we're comfortable with our leverage where it is, and it allows us a lot of flexibility. And keep in mind, we are increasing capital, which consumes some cash as well.\n\n---\n\nI was curious if you could talk a little bit more about the HemisFares rollout. It sounds like that would be a premium quality, premium price point category. And just curious, in exactly which categories are you going to be launching that? How many stores? And really just stepping back and thinking about how does that come to fruition at Kroger? I mean, what's the idea process in terms of bringing that to market? Did -- was that born out of an 84.51° kind of data science project? Or just any color on how that comes to market.\n\n---\n\nWell, the biggest thing it's -- it's really our Corporate Brands team would use the insights from 84.51° plus other research they've done. We find customers are increasingly becoming foodies, and it's really trying to figure out how do you find great products that will satisfy that foodie need experience they want in a way that is actually a very affordable price. And if you look at the quality of this product, if you would go to a restaurant and eat food -- eat something of this quality, it would cost 4 or 5x as much as what it costs with us. So customers get to experience something that's very unique that's outstanding quality. And it's really the team searching across the world, finding items that are very, very unique and very regionally based. The initial items -- I actually don't know how broad it is. I can tell you, the ones I've tried would be more pasta- and sauce-based and olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette. Those types of items are the ones that I've tried. So the things I've tried are more based from Italy, but I'm sure there's others. It's just that's the ones I'm familiar with.\n\n---\n\nYes, the whole idea of HemisFares is to allow our customers to take a journey of food experience around the globe without having to leave home. And it'll be very specific on the packaging where the product's from. The folks at our Corporate Brands who've procured this actually have met with and visited with and helped with the folks who manufacture this product or produce the product on-site in their home country. And some of this product, it's the first time that anybody's gone through the trouble of importing the product with some of the items in it into the U.S. that we have. So they've done a phenomenal job with this, and we're really excited about yet another great offering for our customers in the stores.\n\n---\n\nWe would expect it to be in almost all of our stores. We think most customers will want to engage with it. On some of the items, there is a limited amount of production, so it's not something that you can just go out and produce 2x as much if it sells 2x as much.\n\n---\n\nThat's very helpful. And then, just wanted to ask another question on deflation in some of the categories. I think you mentioned that all departments still comped positive, even though you had some deflation in dairy and produce and maybe seafood for the quarter. So just curious how you manage that. Do you do some incremental promotions in those categories in order to drive volume and increase the comps there when you experience deflation? Or how do you manage that so stably?\n\n---\n\nWell, a lot of times, it depends on what's driving the deflation. In some categories, you have deflation when the product is at its peak and tastes great. If you look at -- like produce. Usually, if there's deflation, that means there's tons of product available, and it's really great product, so you end up selling more. In other areas, when you have deflation, you're able to give such a great value for the customer for the item. So you end up promoting it more and the volume grows. So it's -- we would drive our promotions based on what our insights tell us that customers like and at what point they like versus trying to just make sure we have every department positive. But fortunately, every department was positive identicals. And I know, Mike, you were looking up some of the specific numbers.\n\n---\n\nNo, it's -- I was just looking to -- when you look across the departments, the strength of whether you look at the -- just the IDs or the inflation-adjusted ID sales, it's really pretty remarkable how broad-based the strength of that -- of the momentum is in various departments. I mean, we even -- we had some departments that, even on an inflation-adjusted basis, were still double-digit IDs sales inside their department, and I'm excluding fuel and pharmacy from that. So it's -- at the end of the day, it's really fundamental that -- I spoke of it earlier, why we're so cognizant of what volume we're driving from a unit basis because that's, at the end of the day, what drives your business.\n\n---\n\nJust actually 2 kind of quick ones. Mike, I think you were alluding somewhat to the wage pressures. Can you kind of walk us through, is the wage pressures a lot more than normal for Kroger right now? And is that sort of a broader economic thing? And then, maybe tie into that some maybe more commentary on any changes you're seeing in your overall customer. HemisFares sounds like a more upscale, private-label launch. Are you seeing any change in the amount of trade-up going on? Or any changes in the different levels of your customers' behavior would be helpful.\n\n---\n\nYes, the comments I made earlier weren't directly related to any wage pressures. It was actually the -- our own decision, and Rodney mentioned it as well, of certain departments, where we invested some incremental hours in those departments to drive a better customer experience. And it also happens to be departments where some of our tonnage has been very strong as well. So those hours would have ultimately got -- been in the stores anyway, but it was in advance of that. The wage pressures, I would say, aren't really any different than what we spoke of in the first quarter. There continues to be some out there. We're cognizant of trying to deliver the right overall package to our associates from a solid wage, a good health care package and a retirement plan as well. And we're a little different than a lot of our competitors, where we're balancing all 3 of those for all of our associates. As it relates to HemisFares, I would put that in the category of the Private Selection and Simple Truth range, where it is more of an upscale product and a very high-quality product and it's -- but it does wind up having fairly broad appeal to a lot of folks. Because when you really step back and dissect a lot of customers, there are many customers who, on some items, are a budget shopper, on other items, they wind up splurging on particular items. And these can be the kinds of items those folks wind up splurging on, while in other departments, they're perfectly happy with an entry-level price point or a banner brand that's a lower price point for them. I would say that the HemisFares, as it develops, and Private Selection and Simple Truth, as that mix shifts towards those, it is actually one of the things that's helping to drive our mix to be a little bit different than it has been historically as well.\n\n---\n\nThe thing that's hot so hard to tell -- I don't think it's so much economy-based as customers clearly want high-quality food. So if you look at the areas -- natural and organics, Boar's Head, Starbucks, sushi, all of those areas all have strong, nice growth. So I really -- it really appears to be much different than just economy-based. When you talk to customers, they are definitely interested in saving money. There's no doubt about that.\n\n---\n\nI'll keep this to one question. Just wondering if you could talk about changes in the competitive promotional environment for both the overall business and the natural and organic part of the portfolio. Are you seeing anything different as the second quarter progressed and even third quarter-to-date?\n\n---\n\nYes, as you know, when we look at competition, we always assume that competition is going to get more aggressive going forward than it's been in the past. And we always find that if that doesn't happen, then life's easier. It's just the way we've, years ago, learned to do our business plan. We wouldn't see anything that would be major in changes. There's always a certain promotion or some -- you'll see things that different customers -- competitors do. And you'll see it, even within weeks, changing. So there wasn't anything that I would say is a huge change in the second quarter versus first quarter.\n\n---\n\nCertainly had a nice bounce to the fuel margins here in recent months. If some of this persists, though, would you anticipate reinvesting that back into the business? Or do you think that would -- you'd let that flow through to the bottom line?\n\n---\n\nIt's obviously a good question. It's one where I don't think I would really be able to answer at this point, because it really depends on what's going on in the marketplace and what do we think is the best use of that. So I -- at this point, I really wouldn't think it would be appropriate to answer it.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then, just curious on your click-and-collect experience in those newer markets. Are the customers signing up for some of those longer-term fees like the monthly or annual fees? Or are they gravitating more to the pay-per-visit approach?\n\n---\n\nYou actually have customers doing all 3. I would say, the most customers are on the 2 extremes. They do the yearly approach or the per-order approach. But it's not one of those things where you see 80% of the customers going one way or the other.\n\n---\n\nAnd can you tell if it's incremental in those new markets?\n\n---\n\nIt's -- some of the basket would be incremental, but it's still so early that it's -- I -- the answer I gave you is what we're seeing, but I don't -- I wouldn't use a whole lot of basis off of it, because the sample size is still too small.\n\n---\n\nYes, it's a data point, not a trend.\n\n---\n\nWant to follow up on this volatility that you cited in the -- your product cost. First, on pharmacy inflation with generics, could you quantify or -- specifically or directionally how much that affected gross margin?\n\n---\n\nYes, I wouldn't talk about a direct effect on gross margin, but I will tell you that pharmacy inflation in the quarter continued to be above 9%.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And again, that wasn't passed through due to the contracts and so forth?\n\n---\n\nWell, the -- you have contracts out there that you have to wait till you can pass it through. But also keep in mind, as generic inflation happens, we have the $4 30-day supply and $10 90-day supply, and we haven't changed those price points either.\n\n---\n\nOkay, that's helpful. And on -- when you talked about managing inflation and deflation, you had a good follow-up, I thought, on the pricing versus market share. So let me ask you about just on the inventory side. Does Kroger try to either go long -- commodities are inflating or be a little short those are -- that are deflating? Or is it -- when you talk about managing, is it much more about being sharp on pricing and managing it between -- using price to lever either market share or profitability?\n\n---\n\nYes, the -- we do, do some things for our -- for consumption in our own manufacturing plants when we look at supply of products and the supply chain that is out there. We don't go overboard on hedges, and we really don't use hedges so much. It would be cash purchase contracts to lock in a price for a period of time. But we typically don't get too excited about doing those things unless the current prices and projected prices are trending below a 5-year rolling average because it's -- if you talk to people in the oil industry today, oil is only going to do one thing, and that's go down. And when oil prices are going up and you talk to somebody in the oil industry, they're only going to do one thing, and that's go up forever. And I would say most people in the commodities world has -- have that view. So we're very careful about how we do it. The amount we consume is actually pretty large, so we try not to be -- I use the term a lot internally, I'd rather be approximately correct than precisely wrong. And if I made too big a bet one way or the other, I'd probably be precisely wrong.\n\n---\n\nJust a last thing, so that -- what you just described is only for the vertically integrated part of the business, manufacturing, it doesn't permeate to retail at all? Or does it?\n\n---\n\nYes, it -- so for example, I wouldn't go out, if I see something happening in produce, and try to hedge the apple crop this fall. Probably can't effectively do that anyway. But we do things with growers, trying to lock up fields and things like that, but that's more to make sure we have the exact product we want, not -- we do that regardless of the inflationary environment.\n\n---\n\nThis is actually Brian Cullinane on for Scott. Just wanted to talk broadly. Your business model is clearly unique and advantaged with the data technology that you guys have. Just wanted to touch on how you guys think about expanding and -- whether it's through square-footage growth and acquisitions or building more stores, getting your store and your offering to more consumers kind of in areas that you're not currently in.\n\n---\n\nWell, if you look in terms of going to territories that we are not in at all, as you know, historically, we've done that through mergers. And we're always, as Mike mentioned earlier, looking out for the right one to do something with. We're finding incredible opportunity on fill-ins, and we're -- the -- most of the incremental capital that Mike talked about is, what we're finding, is incremental project opportunities for great projects in existing markets. And right now, that's the highest focus. Now, that doesn't mean that we wouldn't go into a new territory de novo at some point.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And any thoughts to -- you're spending more on capital, but to accelerate any of that with the success that you're having with some of the new stores and new projects?\n\n---\n\nWell, we feel like we already are, if you look at the incremental capital that we're spending, and we continue to push that. So you're always looking for opportunities to grow, but grow and make sure you execute, and we feel like we have started picking up that pace.\n\n---\n\nYes. I prefer an environment where I have a bunch of division presidents upset with me that they have great projects that we haven't been able to fund because of our capital -- what they would call capital constraints, and spending $3.3 billion this year doesn't sound real constrained to me. So if they weren't clamoring for more dollars, I'd be nervous about our opportunities. But as long as they're clamoring, I feel good about where we are.\n\n---\n\nBefore we end today's call, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge that this morning is the 14th anniversary of the attacks of September 11. I know that many on the call today were personally affected by those events. We continue to mourn those we lost on that horrific day and to honor their memory through our support for police, firefighters and other first responders as well as the military and their families. The 9/11 -- I recently had a chance to go to the 9/11 memorial and museum, and it's incredibly touching, and I'm sure most people on the call have. But if you haven't, it's well worth seeing, and it really does make you appreciate all the things that the police, firefighters and other first responders did on that morning.\r\nFinally, I'd like to share some additional thoughts with our associates listening in today. One of the most exciting things about working for a growing and expanding company is the additional opportunities it creates for associates. Many of you would agree that Kroger is a place where you can come for a job and stay for a career. When I ask associates and managers why they stayed, most tell me they fell in love with working with people, our customers and associates, or they found a deep passion for food. Often, it's both. As I mentioned earlier, nearly 70% of our store managers started as hourly associates. I believe there are many young people working for us today who will become our future leaders and will be having Mike's role and other senior leaders' roles and mine. Our associates are people who care, who want to connect with something bigger and make a difference in our communities every day. We ask candidates to imagine you at Kroger, because whether you're looking for a flexible part-time job or for a lasting and rewarding career, you can find it here. And we're looking for friendly, bright people who want opportunities to learn and grow. This is such an exciting time to be at Kroger. Together, we do make a difference. That completes our call for today. Thanks for joining.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Karen Short (Analysts)】\nI just -- I don't want to sound negative here, but I guess, what I'm wondering, in terms of your ID guidance for the year, it definitely reflects a slow-down in the 2-year comp in the third quarter and fourth quarter, even though it looks like inflation is maybe getting a little bit better, maybe less of a headwind. So I guess, any color there. Is this you kind of being conservative? Any color you could give would be helpful.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nWell, it's -- the guidance is always one of the hardest things to come up with what's the right estimate. As you know, we've always expected inflation to continue to slow down during the year, and we would expect that to continue. Now, we're working hard, as always, to make sure that we're at a good side of that. If you look at where we are so far this quarter, we continue to track within those -- within the guidance and kind of similar to where we were in the second quarter. So we feel good about where we are, but -- and we see exciting opportunities. I don't know, Mike, did you want to...\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nYes, Karen, another thing to keep in mind is if you look at real growth, if you look at our current ID sales trend, and even what we would be projecting, and take away the relatively benign inflationary environment today, it's actually as strong of a real growth as we've had in quite some time, really, going all the way back to 3 or 4 years, actually 4 or 5 years. You really don't see a trend as strong as we have today when you look at it on an inflation-adjusted basis. Our tonnage growth is quite strong. And from our standpoint, as long as we continue to have the tonnage growth in many of the departments that we have, we'll be just fine, because that's the ultimate demonstration of the strength of your business is how many items are the customers buying on a weekly and monthly basis.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Karen Short (Analysts)】\nOkay, and that's helpful. And then, I guess, also just on your guidance, I'm -- just was wondering, on your updated pension guidance, you have some changes in both the company and the multiemployer. It's unclear to me on the multiemployer if your prior guidance just didn't include the $60 million that was previously accrued, but you definitely also increased the company-sponsored. So obviously, you're raising your guidance even with these -- those 2 headwinds?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nYes. The $60 million would have been accrued and expensed when it was accrued. Keep in mind that on the multiemployer plans, when you have a contractual obligation or actually put dollars in, you expense it, versus a company plan, we could put money in, and it may not translate to an -- a current expense. So they're quite different in how you account for the 2 calculations. I don't -- it's not a dramatic change in our expectations between the 2 plans, although somewhat...\n\n---\n\n【質問: Karen Short (Analysts)】\nMore of a headwind? Okay, I'll get back in the queue.\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nIt would be -- I mean, it would be a slight headwind compared to where we were earlier in the year, but nothing dramatic.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rupesh Parikh (Analysts)】\nSo I wanted to touch on your pharmacy business. We've seen some of your competitors call out some headwinds within their pharmacy business on the margin line. I just want to get a sense of whether you guys are also seeing some headwinds within your pharmacy business as well on the margin line.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nAs you know, one of the things that's so important for us is our total portfolio of businesses. And when you look, there's almost -- every year, you'll have something stronger and something else weaker. And if you look at the pharmacy business, what we would be experiencing would be pretty similar to what some of our competitors would talk about. We continue to have very strong growth on the number of scripts filled, and that has been true for a long period of time, and our pharmacy teams continue to do a great job on taking care of our customers. But in terms of financial, you -- it would be very similar to what some of the others have talked about. But it is the nice thing and the great thing about having a portfolio of businesses where some pieces are obviously growing well in excess of the total.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rupesh Parikh (Analysts)】\nOkay, great. And then, switching topics to maybe expenses. So the leverage this quarter is much better than what we saw last quarter. Besides sales leverage, was there anything else that may have contributed to the better leverage this period?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nI think it's really across-the-board good cost controls in many facets of the business. As we often say here at Kroger, sales are a beautiful thing. And when you can have north of 5% IDs, the sale leverage -- sales leverage on the expense line becomes quite enormous. And particularly if your ID sales start to exceed where your own expectations were, it gets a little tough to add hours as fast as the sales start to come, and it takes a while to catch up to that. So there was -- there could have been a bit of that as well. But I wouldn't say there is any one particular area that would stand out. It's really pretty strong across-the-board cost controls for many locations.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nOne of the other things that we mentioned on the first quarter, we were pretty aggressive on incrementally investing hours in some places. Some of that, you begin to get the flow of it and you understand, where does it make sense and where doesn't it make sense as well.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Heinbockel (Analysts)】\nSo, guys, 2 things. Do you think -- when you look at the momentum the business has and the things you have to invest in, have we gotten to a point where it's really hard to keep ex fuel EBIT margin to just up slightly, right, without making investments that you don't think have a return? Or you think -- do you think we're just in a period here where timing of investments had been slower, and that's partly why you're getting the 20 basis points?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nI -- when you look at the business overall, I would still feel that slightly improving is where -- is the right thing, long term, for the business and what creates the most sustainable long-term value for the business, and obviously, then, flow through to our shareholders. It's never as easy to be exactly precise every quarter in terms of where you invest and how do the margins flow through. So I feel good about where we are, but I certainly don't believe, as I look forward, to cause us to do anything to adjust what we -- the guidance we've provided. I don't know, Mike, any additional insight?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nYes, and one of the things to keep in mind, John, is we -- as you know, we have a portfolio of things we want to invest in over time. And these aren't promotional activities. To your point, we aren't going to go out and have crazy promotional activity that's not going to be sustainable and drive long-term growth. But we have a portfolio of things we want to continue to invest in. And frankly, some of the strength we're experiencing today is on the backs of some of the investments we made in the third and fourth quarter of last year. And you make a little bit of an investment, and then, several months later, you start to see the fruits of that investment. And that's one of the things that's leading to the strong IDs we've had in the first half. And we've tried to get into this rhythm where we're more diligent about when we invest, how we invest, balanced up against consistent results. And I think we're doing as good a job as we've ever done, and we still have that portfolio of areas where we would like to invest in.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Heinbockel (Analysts)】\nAnd then, Rodney, you talked about the organizational structure, which is quite different than you've had as far back as I can remember. And you said sort of right for this time. Maybe more specifically, what do you think this structure gives you benefit-wise? And then, it does sound like every -- a lot of the guys will have more direct reports than they did before. What do you have to do, if anything, different in how you run the business tactically to account for that, that people would be overseeing more than they had previously?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nWell, a big part of that is just the growth that the team has had. I feel very comfortable that the growth they've had as leaders will allow them to have a little broader span of control than they've had before. As you know, we're incredibly fortunate to have such a great depth of people, and we're incredibly fortunate that they've been at Kroger for a long time. So they really know our business well and they understand what we're trying to get done. For me, it really does eliminate one layer of decision-making, and it really does streamline this -- our ability to make decisions. And the team is working together so well as a team, and I'm just really excited about -- going forward, I think it'll just make it a lot smoother in terms of how the -- how we operate on a day-to-day basis.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Edward Kelly (Analysts)】\nIt's actually Ed Kelly here asking a question for Stephanie. So I guess, my first question for you -- well, my one question...\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nYour one question. Very good.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Edward Kelly (Analysts)】\nI have a follow-up. But so just related to IDs. I mean, your IDs are clearly exceeding expectations. You're raising the full-year guidance for the ID again this quarter. I would guess that the level of inflation is less than what you probably thought coming into the year. And Mike, you talked about it with tonnage, right, being the strongest that it's kind of been in some time. Could you just maybe help us understand how you're driving such strong growth in the business? And maybe even what's surprising you as you look at the top line performance today.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nThe -- it's a great question. And to me, the thing that is so important about what Kroger has been doing for a long period of time, not just in this quarter, is really focusing on multiple aspects of connecting with our customers and associates. So it's really -- we continue to improve the products that our customers have. We -- our merchandisers continue to find new ideas and new products. Our operators continue to improve execution and figuring out ways to take cost out of the business, and we continue to take that and invest in what the customers tell us is important. So it's really all of those things working together. The thing that you never know is how do -- how will competitors react to what you're doing and how -- customers continually change and how do you make sure that you're staying out in front of those changes. So far this year, we're incredibly delighted with how we've identified how the customer's evolving and changing and connecting with those customers in a deeper and deeper way. Our customers tell us, from the way that our associates serve them, the products we deliver, the prices, that we've continued to improve what we're doing, and it's really the combination of all those things working together.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Edward Kelly (Analysts)】\nMaybe just a quick follow-up here on inflation. I think I heard you guys say that you continue to expect inflation to slow throughout the rest of the year. We have, I think, heard from one of your smaller competitors yesterday about particularly produce and maybe produce bottoming and getting better. So could you just maybe provide a little color on some of the categories and how you see that progressing throughout the rest of the year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nYes, Ed, as I said in my prepared comments, the produce picture, actually, the deflation slowed. And actually, if you were to look at the very end of the quarter, there was a slight bit of inflation in the last several weeks. Nothing to write home about, but it was deflationary for the quarter but got less, and actually turned a bit towards the end of the quarter. You continue to see other categories out there that have a mixed bag. Grocery is still, let's call it, just north of flat, just a little bit of inflation, and that's a big driving factor in it. The other one to keep out -- to keep in mind, as you think about inflation, is pharmacy is a big inflationary area that I spoke of as well. The generic costs continue to go up. It's -- on the earlier question on the headwinds from gross margin in pharmacy, it's one of the reasons why that headwind exists, because you can't pass that on as quickly as the cost of the underlying pills go up. So it continues to be a mixed bag. You're seeing some of the meat complex get less inflationary and, in fact, deflationary in some areas, but still some slight inflation in other areas. Seafood is a little deflationary right now, but it continues to be a little bit all over the board.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Vincent Sinisi (Analysts)】\nWanted to ask on the digital initiatives. You guys had said that a few more divisions now have the pick-up-at-store capabilities. Can you give us a little bit more color as to what you're seeing in terms of traction, usage there? What may be in the basket, and then maybe kind of some thoughts going forward for further rollout?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nWell, the -- I -- to give you some insights, the -- it's -- what we find is some customers enjoy shopping that and -- in addition to still buying stuff in the store. So it's -- and you've heard us talk a long time about, on digital, we really do believe it's an and, and not an or. And all it is, is trying to offer one more way of a customer engaging with us so that they get engaged with us the way they want to versus the way they have to. And what we find is the customer feedback has been very positive for some customers, but it's not all customers. And the learnings that we were able to get from Harris Teeter is they really were able to accelerate teaching us how to do it, and then, our store associates are doing a great job of executing against that. In terms of specifics on going forward, the only thing, really, I would say is it continues to be something that we test, and will kind of -- the pace of which we go will really be driven by how fast the customers engage with us. And one of the things that we're trying to do as a company is pace things based on our ability to execute against it and the customer's connection with it. So I wouldn't be able to give you specifics right now because we really don't have specifics yet.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Vincent Sinisi (Analysts)】\nOkay. No, that is helpful. And maybe just as a follow-up, I'll stick with the digital initiatives. And I know you guys have said you're continuing to see some really nice growth in the loyal households. Have there been any changes on your end since the exclusivity with what was dunnhumby over the past couple of quarters has changed? Has there been any change in your approach to getting to know those loyal customers and who you -- who else maybe you are working with or not going forward?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nThe -- I wouldn't say there's been change. The thing that's probably the biggest difference is the leadership team at 84.51° is involved in every meeting now. And it's things when you're trying to make a decision on what you do, the folks are around the table, and they have great insights, so you're really having those insights as part of the decision at the front end rather than at the back end of the conversation. So the biggest thing is just the quality. To say that we get additional insights, I wouldn't say there's additional insight so far. I would say there's a lot of additional projects that we're working on that should help us going forward. That, I feel very confident in, that it just makes it a lot easier to get those things done rather than having to negotiate with a third party.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kenneth Goldman (Analysts)】\nThere's been so much change in Southern California amongst some of your larger peers. And I realize it's not easy, maybe it's impossible to quantify, but can you give us a sense for how much those changes have either benefited you or created a more challenging competitive environment? Just thinking about some of the issues that Haggen has had, some of the changes that Albertsons put into place. If you can address that at all, I'd be appreciative.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nYes, the -- it's one of those where, obviously, it's a good question but hard to answer. When you look at our business in total in Southern California, we're very happy with where we are. But the thing -- the biggest thing that we think is driving it is our associates are doing a great job, and our leadership team there, in terms of improving how we serve our customers. Now whether it's things customers do -- or our competitors are doing that causes our customers to like what we're doing better, that I don't know. I think it's always important to remember that in Southern California, Costco is actually one of our biggest competitors. Whole Foods would be a huge competitor there. You have a ton of really high-quality independents there. So the competition there is very diverse and more than just the Safeway and Albertsons and their merger and  Haggen. So I really -- it's hard to say a certain part is because of whatever somebody is doing. And we're really much more focused on how are the customers telling us we're delivering against what they're asking for. Mike, anything you would want to add to that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nNo, I agree. It's -- when there's any kind of disruption in a market, we look at it as an opportunity from a positive standpoint, not a woe-is-me, oh, what's going to happen, how are we going to deal with this. And when you -- when names change on banners, when people may go to market differently, the opportunity all exists that folks may look for a different place to shop that didn't do that in the past, and we want to make sure that Dawn [ph] and her team continue to do what they're doing to excite our customers and our associates in Southern California.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kenneth Goldman (Analysts)】\nAnd then, my follow-up, I just wanted to confirm that I heard correctly. You did say, I think, 3Q QTD ID sales, ex fuel, similar to what we saw in 2Q, right? [indiscernible]\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\n[indiscernible] What I said is quarter-to-date, it's pretty similar to where we are in quarter 2.\n\n---\n\n【質問: William Kirk (Analysts)】\nSo I had a question on Simple Truth. I think it's in some of your convenience stores now. I was just wondering how the brand's performing in that channel and how many C-stores it is in, I guess.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nI'm looking...\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nI've had C-stores for 2 days, and I already got it in there. Honestly, I don't know the answer to that question. How many it's in or how broad the...\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nYes, on a few select items, it's in -- pretty broad in a lot of our convenience stores, but it's pretty narrow. It's early in the process, and we're really trying to learn how broad can the brand go and who all connects with it. As you know, historically, convenience stores isn't a place you go to for healthy offerings. And we are trying to make sure that the customer, if that's what they want, they can find what they want. So it's early in the process, but we are trying to learn how far the Simple Truth brand can go.\n\n---\n\n【質問: William Kirk (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then, on, I guess, the M&A opportunity environment. We saw repurchases come down in the quarter, leverage is back to about where it was pre-Harris Teeter. How are you feeling about the M&A environment or opportunities in the -- out there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nI would say our M&A appetite is the same as it's always been when the -- if the right opportunity comes along and it's the right set of stores, right sets of assets and right management team, we would think about it. There's not a lot that happens in the space that doesn't come across our desk. I wouldn't read anything into the share buyback coming down in the quarter to signal something on M&A activity. We were pretty upfront that we expected to front-end load our share repurchase program. And really, what you're seeing in the second quarter is the use of stock option proceeds and the tax benefit from that to repurchase shares to offset that dilution. And we're comfortable with our leverage where it is, and it allows us a lot of flexibility. And keep in mind, we are increasing capital, which consumes some cash as well.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kelly Bania (Analysts)】\nI was curious if you could talk a little bit more about the HemisFares rollout. It sounds like that would be a premium quality, premium price point category. And just curious, in exactly which categories are you going to be launching that? How many stores? And really just stepping back and thinking about how does that come to fruition at Kroger? I mean, what's the idea process in terms of bringing that to market? Did -- was that born out of an 84.51° kind of data science project? Or just any color on how that comes to market.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nWell, the biggest thing it's -- it's really our Corporate Brands team would use the insights from 84.51° plus other research they've done. We find customers are increasingly becoming foodies, and it's really trying to figure out how do you find great products that will satisfy that foodie need experience they want in a way that is actually a very affordable price. And if you look at the quality of this product, if you would go to a restaurant and eat food -- eat something of this quality, it would cost 4 or 5x as much as what it costs with us. So customers get to experience something that's very unique that's outstanding quality. And it's really the team searching across the world, finding items that are very, very unique and very regionally based. The initial items -- I actually don't know how broad it is. I can tell you, the ones I've tried would be more pasta- and sauce-based and olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette. Those types of items are the ones that I've tried. So the things I've tried are more based from Italy, but I'm sure there's others. It's just that's the ones I'm familiar with.\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nYes, the whole idea of HemisFares is to allow our customers to take a journey of food experience around the globe without having to leave home. And it'll be very specific on the packaging where the product's from. The folks at our Corporate Brands who've procured this actually have met with and visited with and helped with the folks who manufacture this product or produce the product on-site in their home country. And some of this product, it's the first time that anybody's gone through the trouble of importing the product with some of the items in it into the U.S. that we have. So they've done a phenomenal job with this, and we're really excited about yet another great offering for our customers in the stores.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nWe would expect it to be in almost all of our stores. We think most customers will want to engage with it. On some of the items, there is a limited amount of production, so it's not something that you can just go out and produce 2x as much if it sells 2x as much.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kelly Bania (Analysts)】\nThat's very helpful. And then, just wanted to ask another question on deflation in some of the categories. I think you mentioned that all departments still comped positive, even though you had some deflation in dairy and produce and maybe seafood for the quarter. So just curious how you manage that. Do you do some incremental promotions in those categories in order to drive volume and increase the comps there when you experience deflation? Or how do you manage that so stably?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nWell, a lot of times, it depends on what's driving the deflation. In some categories, you have deflation when the product is at its peak and tastes great. If you look at -- like produce. Usually, if there's deflation, that means there's tons of product available, and it's really great product, so you end up selling more. In other areas, when you have deflation, you're able to give such a great value for the customer for the item. So you end up promoting it more and the volume grows. So it's -- we would drive our promotions based on what our insights tell us that customers like and at what point they like versus trying to just make sure we have every department positive. But fortunately, every department was positive identicals. And I know, Mike, you were looking up some of the specific numbers.\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nNo, it's -- I was just looking to -- when you look across the departments, the strength of whether you look at the -- just the IDs or the inflation-adjusted ID sales, it's really pretty remarkable how broad-based the strength of that -- of the momentum is in various departments. I mean, we even -- we had some departments that, even on an inflation-adjusted basis, were still double-digit IDs sales inside their department, and I'm excluding fuel and pharmacy from that. So it's -- at the end of the day, it's really fundamental that -- I spoke of it earlier, why we're so cognizant of what volume we're driving from a unit basis because that's, at the end of the day, what drives your business.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Ohmes (Analysts)】\nJust actually 2 kind of quick ones. Mike, I think you were alluding somewhat to the wage pressures. Can you kind of walk us through, is the wage pressures a lot more than normal for Kroger right now? And is that sort of a broader economic thing? And then, maybe tie into that some maybe more commentary on any changes you're seeing in your overall customer. HemisFares sounds like a more upscale, private-label launch. Are you seeing any change in the amount of trade-up going on? Or any changes in the different levels of your customers' behavior would be helpful.\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nYes, the comments I made earlier weren't directly related to any wage pressures. It was actually the -- our own decision, and Rodney mentioned it as well, of certain departments, where we invested some incremental hours in those departments to drive a better customer experience. And it also happens to be departments where some of our tonnage has been very strong as well. So those hours would have ultimately got -- been in the stores anyway, but it was in advance of that. The wage pressures, I would say, aren't really any different than what we spoke of in the first quarter. There continues to be some out there. We're cognizant of trying to deliver the right overall package to our associates from a solid wage, a good health care package and a retirement plan as well. And we're a little different than a lot of our competitors, where we're balancing all 3 of those for all of our associates. As it relates to HemisFares, I would put that in the category of the Private Selection and Simple Truth range, where it is more of an upscale product and a very high-quality product and it's -- but it does wind up having fairly broad appeal to a lot of folks. Because when you really step back and dissect a lot of customers, there are many customers who, on some items, are a budget shopper, on other items, they wind up splurging on particular items. And these can be the kinds of items those folks wind up splurging on, while in other departments, they're perfectly happy with an entry-level price point or a banner brand that's a lower price point for them. I would say that the HemisFares, as it develops, and Private Selection and Simple Truth, as that mix shifts towards those, it is actually one of the things that's helping to drive our mix to be a little bit different than it has been historically as well.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nThe thing that's hot so hard to tell -- I don't think it's so much economy-based as customers clearly want high-quality food. So if you look at the areas -- natural and organics, Boar's Head, Starbucks, sushi, all of those areas all have strong, nice growth. So I really -- it really appears to be much different than just economy-based. When you talk to customers, they are definitely interested in saving money. There's no doubt about that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Alvin Concepcion (Analysts)】\nI'll keep this to one question. Just wondering if you could talk about changes in the competitive promotional environment for both the overall business and the natural and organic part of the portfolio. Are you seeing anything different as the second quarter progressed and even third quarter-to-date?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nYes, as you know, when we look at competition, we always assume that competition is going to get more aggressive going forward than it's been in the past. And we always find that if that doesn't happen, then life's easier. It's just the way we've, years ago, learned to do our business plan. We wouldn't see anything that would be major in changes. There's always a certain promotion or some -- you'll see things that different customers -- competitors do. And you'll see it, even within weeks, changing. So there wasn't anything that I would say is a huge change in the second quarter versus first quarter.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Wiltamuth (Analysts)】\nCertainly had a nice bounce to the fuel margins here in recent months. If some of this persists, though, would you anticipate reinvesting that back into the business? Or do you think that would -- you'd let that flow through to the bottom line?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nIt's obviously a good question. It's one where I don't think I would really be able to answer at this point, because it really depends on what's going on in the marketplace and what do we think is the best use of that. So I -- at this point, I really wouldn't think it would be appropriate to answer it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Wiltamuth (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then, just curious on your click-and-collect experience in those newer markets. Are the customers signing up for some of those longer-term fees like the monthly or annual fees? Or are they gravitating more to the pay-per-visit approach?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nYou actually have customers doing all 3. I would say, the most customers are on the 2 extremes. They do the yearly approach or the per-order approach. But it's not one of those things where you see 80% of the customers going one way or the other.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Wiltamuth (Analysts)】\nAnd can you tell if it's incremental in those new markets?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nIt's -- some of the basket would be incremental, but it's still so early that it's -- I -- the answer I gave you is what we're seeing, but I don't -- I wouldn't use a whole lot of basis off of it, because the sample size is still too small.\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nYes, it's a data point, not a trend.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Wolf (Analysts)】\nWant to follow up on this volatility that you cited in the -- your product cost. First, on pharmacy inflation with generics, could you quantify or -- specifically or directionally how much that affected gross margin?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nYes, I wouldn't talk about a direct effect on gross margin, but I will tell you that pharmacy inflation in the quarter continued to be above 9%.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Wolf (Analysts)】\nOkay. And again, that wasn't passed through due to the contracts and so forth?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nWell, the -- you have contracts out there that you have to wait till you can pass it through. But also keep in mind, as generic inflation happens, we have the $4 30-day supply and $10 90-day supply, and we haven't changed those price points either.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Wolf (Analysts)】\nOkay, that's helpful. And on -- when you talked about managing inflation and deflation, you had a good follow-up, I thought, on the pricing versus market share. So let me ask you about just on the inventory side. Does Kroger try to either go long -- commodities are inflating or be a little short those are -- that are deflating? Or is it -- when you talk about managing, is it much more about being sharp on pricing and managing it between -- using price to lever either market share or profitability?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nYes, the -- we do, do some things for our -- for consumption in our own manufacturing plants when we look at supply of products and the supply chain that is out there. We don't go overboard on hedges, and we really don't use hedges so much. It would be cash purchase contracts to lock in a price for a period of time. But we typically don't get too excited about doing those things unless the current prices and projected prices are trending below a 5-year rolling average because it's -- if you talk to people in the oil industry today, oil is only going to do one thing, and that's go down. And when oil prices are going up and you talk to somebody in the oil industry, they're only going to do one thing, and that's go up forever. And I would say most people in the commodities world has -- have that view. So we're very careful about how we do it. The amount we consume is actually pretty large, so we try not to be -- I use the term a lot internally, I'd rather be approximately correct than precisely wrong. And if I made too big a bet one way or the other, I'd probably be precisely wrong.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Wolf (Analysts)】\nJust a last thing, so that -- what you just described is only for the vertically integrated part of the business, manufacturing, it doesn't permeate to retail at all? Or does it?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nYes, it -- so for example, I wouldn't go out, if I see something happening in produce, and try to hedge the apple crop this fall. Probably can't effectively do that anyway. But we do things with growers, trying to lock up fields and things like that, but that's more to make sure we have the exact product we want, not -- we do that regardless of the inflationary environment.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Brian Cullinane (Analysts)】\nThis is actually Brian Cullinane on for Scott. Just wanted to talk broadly. Your business model is clearly unique and advantaged with the data technology that you guys have. Just wanted to touch on how you guys think about expanding and -- whether it's through square-footage growth and acquisitions or building more stores, getting your store and your offering to more consumers kind of in areas that you're not currently in.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nWell, if you look in terms of going to territories that we are not in at all, as you know, historically, we've done that through mergers. And we're always, as Mike mentioned earlier, looking out for the right one to do something with. We're finding incredible opportunity on fill-ins, and we're -- the -- most of the incremental capital that Mike talked about is, what we're finding, is incremental project opportunities for great projects in existing markets. And right now, that's the highest focus. Now, that doesn't mean that we wouldn't go into a new territory de novo at some point.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Brian Cullinane (Analysts)】\nGreat. And any thoughts to -- you're spending more on capital, but to accelerate any of that with the success that you're having with some of the new stores and new projects?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nWell, we feel like we already are, if you look at the incremental capital that we're spending, and we continue to push that. So you're always looking for opportunities to grow, but grow and make sure you execute, and we feel like we have started picking up that pace.\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nYes. I prefer an environment where I have a bunch of division presidents upset with me that they have great projects that we haven't been able to fund because of our capital -- what they would call capital constraints, and spending $3.3 billion this year doesn't sound real constrained to me. So if they weren't clamoring for more dollars, I'd be nervous about our opportunities. But as long as they're clamoring, I feel good about where we are.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nBefore we end today's call, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge that this morning is the 14th anniversary of the attacks of September 11. I know that many on the call today were personally affected by those events. We continue to mourn those we lost on that horrific day and to honor their memory through our support for police, firefighters and other first responders as well as the military and their families. The 9/11 -- I recently had a chance to go to the 9/11 memorial and museum, and it's incredibly touching, and I'm sure most people on the call have. But if you haven't, it's well worth seeing, and it really does make you appreciate all the things that the police, firefighters and other first responders did on that morning.\r\nFinally, I'd like to share some additional thoughts with our associates listening in today. One of the most exciting things about working for a growing and expanding company is the additional opportunities it creates for associates. Many of you would agree that Kroger is a place where you can come for a job and stay for a career. When I ask associates and managers why they stayed, most tell me they fell in love with working with people, our customers and associates, or they found a deep passion for food. Often, it's both. As I mentioned earlier, nearly 70% of our store managers started as hourly associates. I believe there are many young people working for us today who will become our future leaders and will be having Mike's role and other senior leaders' roles and mine. Our associates are people who care, who want to connect with something bigger and make a difference in our communities every day. We ask candidates to imagine you at Kroger, because whether you're looking for a flexible part-time job or for a lasting and rewarding career, you can find it here. And we're looking for friendly, bright people who want opportunities to learn and grow. This is such an exciting time to be at Kroger. Together, we do make a difference. That completes our call for today. Thanks for joining.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you, operator. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss NIKE's fiscal 2016 first quarter results. As the operator indicated, participants on today's call may discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the appropriate reconciliations in our press release, which was issued about an hour ago, and at our website, investors.nike.com.\r\nJoining us on today's call will be NIKE, Inc.'s President and CEO, Mark Parker; followed by Trevor Edwards, President of the NIKE Brand; and finally, you'll hear from our new Chief Financial Officer, Andy Campion, who will give you an in-depth review of our financial results. Following their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you for your cooperation on this.\r\nNow I'll turn the call over to NIKE, Inc.'s President and CEO, Mark Parker.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Kelley, and hello, everyone. Now before I move into a discussion on our business, I want to take a moment to introduce our new Chief Financial Officer, Andy Campion. As you know, Don Blair retired from the CFO role as of July 31, and I'm happy to formally welcome Andy into his new role. Andy has been a key member of the NIKE leadership team for the past 8 years and bring to his new role both a passion for the brand and a commitment to driving shareholder value. You'll hear from Andy at the end the call to discuss our results in detail, but let me start with a few of my thoughts as we begin the new fiscal year.\r\nLast year at this time, I talked about our focus on 3 key areas: the depth of our relationships with our athletes and consumers, our fast-paced culture of innovation, and the power of our portfolio. We strengthened all of these areas throughout last year and we delivered tremendous results. In Q1, we carried that momentum forward with an outstanding start to fiscal year '16.\r\nLet's take a look at the highlights from the first quarter. NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 5% to $8.4 billion despite significant FX headwinds. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 14%. Gross margin expanded 90 basis points to 47.5% and earnings per share increased 23% to $1.34.\r\nUltimately, NIKE continues to succeed because of the deep relationships we have with the athlete and the consumer, relationships we know we must earn every day. And we have a thoughtful long-term growth plan, which we continue to execute at the highest level. We invest in our biggest opportunities, and we've built a diversified portfolio to give us the flexibility to pull the right levers at the right time to maximize growth. Our powerful portfolio of categories, geographies, brands and channels across men's, women's and young athletes is one of our greatest competitive advantages, and we continue to see new ways to unlock growth all over the world. And while we're not immune to the macroeconomic challenges that all businesses are facing, we are best positioned and best resourced to navigate the short term and thrive for the long term. NIKE is on a relentless pace, and we have no intention of slowing down.\r\nLeveraging our portfolio is one way we sustain growth. The other, of course, is through innovation. We showed the power of our scale this quarter as we share technologies from one category to another and from one brand to another. This is how innovation can create separation, and this is something only NIKE can do.\r\nJust a couple of quick highlights. In footwear, we launched the Pegasus 32 in June 2015, which featured high-performance Zoom Air technology. It delivers highly responsive cushioning and lightweight support to help athletes achieve their fastest run.\r\nIn the Jordan Brand, we introduced the Super.Fly 4 with FlightSpeed technology, offering lightweight comfort and impact protection.\r\nIn performance apparel, we just announced 2 new technologies that solve for temperature regulation in completely new ways: Therma-Sphere Max, a composite material designed for lightweight warmth and mobility for outdoor training; and then AeroReact, an adaptive material that reacts to the heat and moisture of the body. The fibers of the fabric open up when they get wet and they close as they dry out again, offering both active cooling and warmth all in one layer.\r\nGoing forward, you can expect to see further acceleration in our innovation agenda for performance apparel as we look ahead to the Summer Olympics in Rio and beyond. So stay tuned for more on that later in the year.\r\nAnd in Sportswear apparel, we delivered our latest silhouettes of Tech Fleece for men and women. Over the past several seasons, NIKE Tech Pack has created great demand for premium Lifestyle apparel with technical performance innovation.\r\nA great example of leveraging innovation across multiple dimensions of our business is reflected in Hurley, Jordan and Converse, utilizing NIKE technology to create exciting new concepts of their own. Hurley once again applied a footwear innovation to their industry-leading Phantom Elite board short, this time using NIKE Madwire [ph], a dynamic stability support system for a lockdown fit in the waistband.\r\nThe Jordan Brand continued to bring its unique perspective to Training with the Flight Flex Trainer 2 and its Nike Free-inspired natural motion midsole. Looking ahead, we see tremendous opportunity for the Jordan Brand to transcend its core Basketball positioning into new areas of growth.\r\nAnd finally, the legendary Chuck Taylor All Star received a performance innovation boost, adding a NIKE Lunarlon sockliner, a padded collar and breathable liner to the Converse classic. The Chuck Taylor All Star II brought new comfort details but stayed true to the silhouette that Chuck fans know and love. The potential for Converse has never been greater as we continue to expand globally and further diversify this great brand.\r\nThese are just a few examples that show how we take our best ideas and accelerate them across our categories and brands to serve our consumers and drive growth.\r\nAs you've heard me say many times, innovation at NIKE goes beyond product, and digital is a great example. Digital is an accelerator throughout NIKE. It is a platform that enables new ways of working and new methods of manufacturing. It drives how we connect with consumers, how we serve them and how we engage with one another. It helps us fuel our growth by serving our consumers whenever they want NIKE products for any sport all over the world.\r\nOur digital ecosystem delivers a connected growing community, personal real-time engagement and easier access to the product they love, head to toe. We stand alone because we connect all 3 to give the most holistic, premium experience to the consumer. And when we serve the consumer better through digital, we drive growth.\r\nJust to look at this quarter's revenue for e-commerce business. It's up an incredible 46% on a constant currency basis, with robust growth across all of our geographies. We also saw strong conversion and increased traffic, particularly on mobile.\r\nOur Q1 results clearly demonstrate our ability to continue to drive sustainable, profitable growth. And while we feel great about the last 90 days, we remain laser focused on continuing this momentum over the balance of the fiscal year and beyond.\r\nThe rest of fiscal '16 is filled with important sports moments: the Super Bowl, the NBA All-Star Weekend, Euro Champs, and of course, the lead up to the Rio Olympics. Every one of them is an opportunity for NIKE, an opportunity to innovate for the athletes, to inspire the consumer and to grow the business. And just like the athletes we serve, these opportunities compel us to keep raising the bar because in the end, the power of NIKE lies not only in our ability to see the future but to create it. And you can expect us to continue to do just that.\r\nSo thanks. And now here's Trevor.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Mark. It's a new fiscal year but the strong results continue for the NIKE Brand. Q1 proved yet again the sustained power of the category offense. As we've said, the category offense drives deep and meaningful relationships with consumers. This provides us with great insights to create innovative products, rich services and inspiring experiences that our consumers love.\r\nFor the quarter, on a constant currency basis, NIKE Brand revenue grew 15%, with double-digit growth across nearly every geography and most key categories. NIKE Brand DTC revenue increased 21%, driven by new store expansion; continued strong growth in online sales, up 46%; and comp store growth of 7%. And we are very pleased with global futures, up a strong 17%. Clearly, the category offense continues to drive growth around the world and remains the foundation of our strategy as we look ahead. As always, we use the power of our vast portfolio to target the best growth opportunities for the brand. And what gives us that flexibility is the breadth and depth of our category expertise.\r\nTo see these dynamics in action, let's first take a look at Running. Our obsession with speed has driven us for years, so we never settle, always looking to shave off that extra second. This relentless focus on innovation can be seen in the momentum of our Zoom Air technology. Propelling the runner forward with an ultra-responsive step, Zoom Air technology drives key product styles like our Pegasus 32, Vomero 10 and the Elite 8.\r\nIn Q1, Zoom helped ignite our global community of runners through a special event we called the Fastest Day On Earth, in which we challenge runners to run their fastest mile ever. The event concluded with NIKE celebrating each runner's fastest mile with a personalized video that included the runner's name, mile time and clips from their route using Google Street View. This storytelling saw excellent response, reaching millions of consumers across social media.\r\nLooking at performance apparel. We continue to build on the growth momentum of NIKE Dri-FIT. We launched the Contour Running Top, which features zoned breathability for increased comfort and mobility. And to further express the runner's love of this sport, our Running-inspired Sportswear styles also continue to resonate. Two decades after its introduction, we celebrated the Air Max 95 by releasing the original silhouette. And we brought it into the future with new technologies in the Air Max 95 Ultra.\r\nAnother strong growth driver in Q1 was our women's business, with revenue growing double digits. We launched the highly anticipated training shoe, the MetCon 1 for women, which offers just a hint of what's to come in Training. We continue to lead with key apparel styles such as the Dri-FIT Knit bras and Nike Pro Tights, all of which are important drivers for this business. And Sportswear delivered strong growth with footwear styles like the Roshe and the entire Air Max platform, which continues to be very popular with women. In addition to delivering innovative new products to the market, we also remained focused on creating compelling regional executions for her, both through our own DTC and with our wholesale partners.\r\nThe rollout of premium and elevated doors throughout the globe continues to drive this important business, as highlighted by the ongoing success of Foot Locker's SIX:02 executions and the launch of the Chelsea Collective doors with Dick's Sporting Goods. The effects we're seeing in women's is truly comprehensive as all facets of the business continue to excel, from products to services, from footwear to apparel and across sports and throughout the entire athlete's life. We are excited about the future of the women's business. With the shift towards -- the global shift towards the health and fitness as part of her lifestyle, we see tremendous opportunity for years to come.\r\nNow let's shift on to a few of our key geographies. North America had another great quarter, with revenues up 9% and futures up 15%. This geography continues to drive strong growth across nearly all key categories. Time and time again, even though this is our most developed market, North America proves that the right strategies can drive consistent, profitable growth. The energy of our brand in North America is clear, with continued strong demand across our executions with wholesale partners such as Dick's Sporting Goods, Foot Locker and the Finish Line. We continue to serve this consumer through our amplified strategy, delivering both performance and Lifestyle products. At the same time, we continue to work to effectively manage the flow of inventory in North America, including the impact of the West Coast port congestion from earlier this calendar year. While the flow of product from the port has now returned to normal, we are working to efficiently clear excess inventory to keep our in-line channel healthy.\r\nIn addition, we have recently expanded our North American distribution center and are working to bring this new capacity fully online. We expect both these efforts to be complete by the end of Q3 and inventory levels in North America to normalize at that time. Ultimately, our confidence in the category offense in North America gives us the road map to continue to unlock growth opportunities, both this year and far into the future.\r\nNow let's turn to Western Europe. Q1 revenue grew 14%, driven by growth in all territories and nearly all key categories. This growth continues to be fueled by the transformation of the marketplace along the category offense. This work includes elevated executions at Intersport, the new Oxford Street location with JD Sports in London and the expansion of the House of Hoops of Foot Locker in Berlin. And our own DTC continues to perform very well, delivering 31% growth in Q1.\r\nBy being both deliberate and aggressive, we lead the market as Western Europe's most desired sports brand. We're excited about what the future holds as we execute our complete offense in Western Europe.\r\nNow on to the emerging markets, which delivered strong Q1 results with revenue up 19%, driven by strong growth in Mexico and most key categories. The improvement we've seen in Mexico contributed significantly to the overall results in the geography as we see the benefit of investing in and elevating our distribution. For example, we launched the House for Her [ph] in Mexico City, a product showcase supported by great service, experience and community. Also, prominent marketplace executions with partners such as Liverpool, which is Mexico's largest department store, and Innovasport are also performing well. As these new doors prove, by elevating the marketplace, we grow the market in key geographies and territories. Overall, we believe we are now well positioned to drive profitable, long-term growth in Mexico.\r\nIn Brazil, revenue was flat, an improvement in trend and market share, but still reflective of the continued challenges in the macroeconomic landscape. That said, we continue to focus on our strategy of resetting the marketplace along the category offense. By focusing on differentiating our points of distribution and creating more compelling consumer experiences at retail and online, we drive increased productivity and profitability for NIKE and our wholesale partners. Overall, we continue to see tremendous growth potential for the emerging markets long term and are confident that we are executing the right strategies to realize that potential in this important geography.\r\nFinally, in Greater China, revenue was up an amazing 30%, tremendous growth that again proves, more than ever, the success of our strategies. These gains were driven by strong performance across nearly all key categories, including Sportswear, Running and Basketball. For our wholesale partners like ByLee, the doors that have been reprofiled continue to outperform the rest of the fleet, driving expanded productivity and profitability. We also saw strong growth from our DTC business, driven by comp store sales increases and an acceleration in our e-commerce business.\r\nIt was a very active quarter for China in sports as Beijing hosted the track and field world championships in which athletes wearing NIKE footwear dominated, taking home the majority of medals awarded. And throughout quarter 1, athletes like LeBron James, Kobe, Anthony Davis and Paul George all participated in NIKE Basketball events throughout China, connecting with thousands of consumers through their shared passion of the sport. And just 2 days ago, we announced that Michael Jordan will travel to Shanghai in mid-October to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Air Jordan franchise. All told, the incredible growth we saw in China this quarter reflects our ongoing efforts to align the marketplace to the category offense, a strategy that we expect will drive growth in this critical geography for many years to come.\r\nIn the end, the NIKE Brand started the new fiscal year with energy throughout the entire portfolio of geographies and categories, and we expect to leverage this energy going forward because at NIKE, the opportunities offered by our complete offense are limitless across men's, women's and young athletes and across categories, geographies, product types and also marketplaces.\r\nFiscal year '16 promises to be another year where the choices and investments we make propel us to serve the athlete with even more premium products, services and experiences. While we may be just out of the blocks in quarter 1, we are already in full sprint towards a year of continued growth of this brand and this company.\r\nThanks. And now on his first earnings call as NIKE's new CFO, here is Andy.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Mark and Trevor, and hello to our stakeholders on the call. I've had the pleasure of meeting many of you over the last several years, and I very much look forward to deeper engagement over time.\r\nWith this being my first earnings call, I'd like to take a moment to reinforce a few of our long-standing guiding principles and also briefly touch on how we will continue to evolve and innovate.\r\nOur primary financial objective has been, and will continue to be, delivering extraordinary value to our shareholders. Delivering value to shareholders is, first and foremost, a function of creating value for consumers. As consumer expectations continue to accelerate, NIKE will evolve and innovate to exceed those expectations. At NIKE, innovation is in our DNA. That applies to all dimensions of our business, from the products and services that we deliver to consumers to the operating and business models that we employ. That is what we call being on the offense always.\r\nAs we create value for consumers, we will continue to capture that value through disciplined and consistent financial management. NIKE knows how to grow. We're also deeply committed to ensuring that our growth is profitable, sustainable and capital efficient over the long term. We do that through robust gross margin management, continually enhancing the productivity of our resources and investing surgically and strategically in those opportunities with the highest potential for return.\r\nFinally, as we create value for consumers and we capture that value financially, we will also deliver that value to shareholders through capital management, risk management and consistently increasing our cash returns through both share repurchases and dividends.\r\nHaving worked very closely with Mark, Trevor and my predecessor, Don, since joining NIKE in 2007, I'm deeply invested in the strategies that have fueled our strong performance to date. And I believe we have tremendous potential to grow and create value for both consumers and shareholders over the long term. As we say at NIKE, there is no finish line.\r\nOur Q1 financial performance and outlook for the balance of the year reflect both the value we are creating for consumers and the principles that we apply to financial management. So I'm very pleased to share our results in more detail.\r\nQ1 reported revenue for NIKE, Inc. increased 5% and grew 14% on a currency-neutral basis. The NIKE Brand grew 15% on a currency-neutral basis and Converse grew 3%. Growth in the NIKE Brand was broad based and strong across all geographies and nearly all categories.\r\nAlso on a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand futures orders grew 17%, driven by an 11% increase in units and a 6% increase in average selling prices. Our futures growth reflects continued strong demand and healthy pull markets across the NIKE Brand portfolio. All geographies grew double digits, except emerging markets, which grew 6%. On a reported basis, futures grew 9%, reflecting a stronger U.S. dollar against nearly all international currencies.\r\nQ1 diluted EPS grew 23% to $1.34 despite significant FX headwinds. Our EPS growth was driven by strong top line growth and effective financial management across all levers of the business. Gross margin expanded 90 basis points to 47.5%, primarily driven by higher average selling prices and continued strong growth in our higher-margin Direct-to-Consumer business, partially offset by higher product input cost and warehousing.\r\nQ1 demand creation declined 7%, reflecting favorable comparisons against higher investment in the World Cup in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. Operating overhead increased 10% for the quarter, driven by variable costs associated with continued strong growth in our DTC business and targeted investments in consumer-focused digital capabilities and operational infrastructure.\r\nOur effective tax rate was 18.4% for Q1, lower than prior year, primarily due to an increase in the proportion of earnings from operations outside of the U.S., which are generally subject to a lower tax rate, as well as certain nonrecurring items that were recognized in the first quarter.\r\nAs of August 31, inventories were up 10%, primarily to support strong demand across our business. Overall, inventories continue to be healthy around the globe. However, as Trevor discussed, we do expect inventories in North America to be somewhat elevated for the next 2 quarters. And we anticipate there will be an impact on gross margin in the near term as we work to clear excess inventory.\r\nNow let's take a look at our performance by segment. North America delivered another strong quarter, with 9% revenue growth on a currency-neutral basis, driven by strength in nearly every key category, led by Sportswear, Basketball, Men's Training and Running. And consumer demand for NIKE remains strong in North America, with futures growth of 15% on a currency-neutral basis. On a reported basis, North America revenue grew 8% and EBIT grew 7% due to slightly lower gross margin, partially offset by SG&A leverage.\r\nWestern Europe also had a great quarter, with Q1 revenue up 14% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by growth in every territory. These results and our continued momentum in Western Europe reflect our broader and deeper execution of the category offense. Nearly all key categories delivered strong growth, fueled by Sportswear, Basketball and Running, while Global Football declined due to tough comparisons to higher World Cup revenues in the prior year. On a reported basis, Q1 revenue declined 4% due to weakness in the euro. However, EBIT increased 20%, driven by gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.\r\nIn Central and Eastern Europe, Q1 revenue grew 26% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by double-digit growth in every territory except Greece and double-digit growth in nearly every key category. On a reported basis, Q1 revenue grew 2%, reflecting significantly weaker currencies, in particular the ruble and the Turkish lira. However, EBIT grew 42%, due primarily to strong gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.\r\nNow turning to China, where revenue grew an impressive 30% for the quarter on both a reported and currency-neutral basis. While we are very mindful of the macroeconomic volatility in China, our brand has never been stronger and our marketplace has never been more healthy. We have momentum across nearly all key categories as well as continued strength in our DTC business. EBIT for China grew 51% in Q1 due to very strong revenue growth, gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.\r\nIn our emerging markets geography, Q1 revenue increased 19% on a constant currency basis, as nearly all territories delivered strong growth in the quarter, driven by Mexico, Soco and Pacific. Nearly every key category grew for the quarter, led by Sportswear, Action Sports and Basketball.\r\nAs Trevor discussed in his remarks, Mexico returned to strong growth as a result of our efforts to optimize inventory and reset that market. And while revenue was flat in Brazil, our brand is strong and we continue to gain share, while also investing to reset that marketplace along the lines of the category offense.\r\nOn a reported basis, emerging markets revenue increased 3% for the quarter and EBIT rose 65%, reflecting gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.\r\nAt Converse, Q1 revenue grew 3% on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by double-digit growth in the U.S., partially offset by declines in certain European countries, primarily the U.K. The Converse brand remains strong and was further enhanced by the launch of the Chuck II in the first quarter. However, quarterly year-over-year comparisons will be somewhat uneven as we transition to a more direct operating model outside of the U.S. \r\nOn a reported basis, Converse revenue declined 3%, primarily due to the weaker euro. And EBIT decreased 21% for the quarter, driven primarily by lower sales in the U.K. as well as SG&A investments in infrastructure and Converse intellectual property enforcement efforts.\r\nNIKE, Inc. delivered strong financial performance in the first quarter despite significant FX headwinds, and we have healthy momentum across our global portfolio. Our outlook for the balance of the year reflects that momentum as well as continued investment in our growth strategies and operational capabilities. Specifically, for Q2, we expect reported revenue growth at a mid-single-digit rate, generally in line with the growth rate for Q1, reflecting low-teens growth on a currency-neutral basis, largely offset by the impact of the stronger dollar. Our expectations for Q2 revenue also reflect the fact that our futures growth is more heavily weighted towards the back half of the futures window. For the full year, our outlook has slightly improved, but we continue to expect that reported revenue growth will be squarely within the mid-single-digit range.\r\nWe expect gross margin for Q2 to expand by about 25 basis points, reflecting our efforts to expeditiously clear excess inventory in North America and keep the in-line channel fresh. For the full year, we continue to expect gross margin to expand by about 50 basis points, including our stronger-than-expected actual performance in Q1, combined with our current expectations for Q2 and the balance of the year. For total SG&A, we expect Q2 and the full year to grow at a high single-digit rate, reflecting continued investments in DTC, consumer-facing digital capabilities and infrastructure as well as key brand events as we lead up to the Euro Champs and the Summer Olympics in Rio.\r\nWe continue to anticipate other income will have a more meaningful impact on our fiscal year '16 results than we have seen historically, as a portion of our expected FX hedge gains are reported in this line item. Absent significant changes in FX, we continue to expect other income will be about $50 million for each of the next 3 quarters.\r\nWe now expect our effective tax rate will be approximately 22% for the full year, including the lower actual rate in Q1 and an average rate of about 24% for Q2 through Q4. \r\nWith that, we'll now open up for questions.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Kelley Hall (Executives)】\nThank you, operator. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss NIKE's fiscal 2016 first quarter results. As the operator indicated, participants on today's call may discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the appropriate reconciliations in our press release, which was issued about an hour ago, and at our website, investors.nike.com.\r\nJoining us on today's call will be NIKE, Inc.'s President and CEO, Mark Parker; followed by Trevor Edwards, President of the NIKE Brand; and finally, you'll hear from our new Chief Financial Officer, Andy Campion, who will give you an in-depth review of our financial results. Following their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you for your cooperation on this.\r\nNow I'll turn the call over to NIKE, Inc.'s President and CEO, Mark Parker.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Mark Parker (Executives)】\nThank you, Kelley, and hello, everyone. Now before I move into a discussion on our business, I want to take a moment to introduce our new Chief Financial Officer, Andy Campion. As you know, Don Blair retired from the CFO role as of July 31, and I'm happy to formally welcome Andy into his new role. Andy has been a key member of the NIKE leadership team for the past 8 years and bring to his new role both a passion for the brand and a commitment to driving shareholder value. You'll hear from Andy at the end the call to discuss our results in detail, but let me start with a few of my thoughts as we begin the new fiscal year.\r\nLast year at this time, I talked about our focus on 3 key areas: the depth of our relationships with our athletes and consumers, our fast-paced culture of innovation, and the power of our portfolio. We strengthened all of these areas throughout last year and we delivered tremendous results. In Q1, we carried that momentum forward with an outstanding start to fiscal year '16.\r\nLet's take a look at the highlights from the first quarter. NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 5% to $8.4 billion despite significant FX headwinds. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 14%. Gross margin expanded 90 basis points to 47.5% and earnings per share increased 23% to $1.34.\r\nUltimately, NIKE continues to succeed because of the deep relationships we have with the athlete and the consumer, relationships we know we must earn every day. And we have a thoughtful long-term growth plan, which we continue to execute at the highest level. We invest in our biggest opportunities, and we've built a diversified portfolio to give us the flexibility to pull the right levers at the right time to maximize growth. Our powerful portfolio of categories, geographies, brands and channels across men's, women's and young athletes is one of our greatest competitive advantages, and we continue to see new ways to unlock growth all over the world. And while we're not immune to the macroeconomic challenges that all businesses are facing, we are best positioned and best resourced to navigate the short term and thrive for the long term. NIKE is on a relentless pace, and we have no intention of slowing down.\r\nLeveraging our portfolio is one way we sustain growth. The other, of course, is through innovation. We showed the power of our scale this quarter as we share technologies from one category to another and from one brand to another. This is how innovation can create separation, and this is something only NIKE can do.\r\nJust a couple of quick highlights. In footwear, we launched the Pegasus 32 in June 2015, which featured high-performance Zoom Air technology. It delivers highly responsive cushioning and lightweight support to help athletes achieve their fastest run.\r\nIn the Jordan Brand, we introduced the Super.Fly 4 with FlightSpeed technology, offering lightweight comfort and impact protection.\r\nIn performance apparel, we just announced 2 new technologies that solve for temperature regulation in completely new ways: Therma-Sphere Max, a composite material designed for lightweight warmth and mobility for outdoor training; and then AeroReact, an adaptive material that reacts to the heat and moisture of the body. The fibers of the fabric open up when they get wet and they close as they dry out again, offering both active cooling and warmth all in one layer.\r\nGoing forward, you can expect to see further acceleration in our innovation agenda for performance apparel as we look ahead to the Summer Olympics in Rio and beyond. So stay tuned for more on that later in the year.\r\nAnd in Sportswear apparel, we delivered our latest silhouettes of Tech Fleece for men and women. Over the past several seasons, NIKE Tech Pack has created great demand for premium Lifestyle apparel with technical performance innovation.\r\nA great example of leveraging innovation across multiple dimensions of our business is reflected in Hurley, Jordan and Converse, utilizing NIKE technology to create exciting new concepts of their own. Hurley once again applied a footwear innovation to their industry-leading Phantom Elite board short, this time using NIKE Madwire [ph], a dynamic stability support system for a lockdown fit in the waistband.\r\nThe Jordan Brand continued to bring its unique perspective to Training with the Flight Flex Trainer 2 and its Nike Free-inspired natural motion midsole. Looking ahead, we see tremendous opportunity for the Jordan Brand to transcend its core Basketball positioning into new areas of growth.\r\nAnd finally, the legendary Chuck Taylor All Star received a performance innovation boost, adding a NIKE Lunarlon sockliner, a padded collar and breathable liner to the Converse classic. The Chuck Taylor All Star II brought new comfort details but stayed true to the silhouette that Chuck fans know and love. The potential for Converse has never been greater as we continue to expand globally and further diversify this great brand.\r\nThese are just a few examples that show how we take our best ideas and accelerate them across our categories and brands to serve our consumers and drive growth.\r\nAs you've heard me say many times, innovation at NIKE goes beyond product, and digital is a great example. Digital is an accelerator throughout NIKE. It is a platform that enables new ways of working and new methods of manufacturing. It drives how we connect with consumers, how we serve them and how we engage with one another. It helps us fuel our growth by serving our consumers whenever they want NIKE products for any sport all over the world.\r\nOur digital ecosystem delivers a connected growing community, personal real-time engagement and easier access to the product they love, head to toe. We stand alone because we connect all 3 to give the most holistic, premium experience to the consumer. And when we serve the consumer better through digital, we drive growth.\r\nJust to look at this quarter's revenue for e-commerce business. It's up an incredible 46% on a constant currency basis, with robust growth across all of our geographies. We also saw strong conversion and increased traffic, particularly on mobile.\r\nOur Q1 results clearly demonstrate our ability to continue to drive sustainable, profitable growth. And while we feel great about the last 90 days, we remain laser focused on continuing this momentum over the balance of the fiscal year and beyond.\r\nThe rest of fiscal '16 is filled with important sports moments: the Super Bowl, the NBA All-Star Weekend, Euro Champs, and of course, the lead up to the Rio Olympics. Every one of them is an opportunity for NIKE, an opportunity to innovate for the athletes, to inspire the consumer and to grow the business. And just like the athletes we serve, these opportunities compel us to keep raising the bar because in the end, the power of NIKE lies not only in our ability to see the future but to create it. And you can expect us to continue to do just that.\r\nSo thanks. And now here's Trevor.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Trevor Edwards (Executives)】\nThank you, Mark. It's a new fiscal year but the strong results continue for the NIKE Brand. Q1 proved yet again the sustained power of the category offense. As we've said, the category offense drives deep and meaningful relationships with consumers. This provides us with great insights to create innovative products, rich services and inspiring experiences that our consumers love.\r\nFor the quarter, on a constant currency basis, NIKE Brand revenue grew 15%, with double-digit growth across nearly every geography and most key categories. NIKE Brand DTC revenue increased 21%, driven by new store expansion; continued strong growth in online sales, up 46%; and comp store growth of 7%. And we are very pleased with global futures, up a strong 17%. Clearly, the category offense continues to drive growth around the world and remains the foundation of our strategy as we look ahead. As always, we use the power of our vast portfolio to target the best growth opportunities for the brand. And what gives us that flexibility is the breadth and depth of our category expertise.\r\nTo see these dynamics in action, let's first take a look at Running. Our obsession with speed has driven us for years, so we never settle, always looking to shave off that extra second. This relentless focus on innovation can be seen in the momentum of our Zoom Air technology. Propelling the runner forward with an ultra-responsive step, Zoom Air technology drives key product styles like our Pegasus 32, Vomero 10 and the Elite 8.\r\nIn Q1, Zoom helped ignite our global community of runners through a special event we called the Fastest Day On Earth, in which we challenge runners to run their fastest mile ever. The event concluded with NIKE celebrating each runner's fastest mile with a personalized video that included the runner's name, mile time and clips from their route using Google Street View. This storytelling saw excellent response, reaching millions of consumers across social media.\r\nLooking at performance apparel. We continue to build on the growth momentum of NIKE Dri-FIT. We launched the Contour Running Top, which features zoned breathability for increased comfort and mobility. And to further express the runner's love of this sport, our Running-inspired Sportswear styles also continue to resonate. Two decades after its introduction, we celebrated the Air Max 95 by releasing the original silhouette. And we brought it into the future with new technologies in the Air Max 95 Ultra.\r\nAnother strong growth driver in Q1 was our women's business, with revenue growing double digits. We launched the highly anticipated training shoe, the MetCon 1 for women, which offers just a hint of what's to come in Training. We continue to lead with key apparel styles such as the Dri-FIT Knit bras and Nike Pro Tights, all of which are important drivers for this business. And Sportswear delivered strong growth with footwear styles like the Roshe and the entire Air Max platform, which continues to be very popular with women. In addition to delivering innovative new products to the market, we also remained focused on creating compelling regional executions for her, both through our own DTC and with our wholesale partners.\r\nThe rollout of premium and elevated doors throughout the globe continues to drive this important business, as highlighted by the ongoing success of Foot Locker's SIX:02 executions and the launch of the Chelsea Collective doors with Dick's Sporting Goods. The effects we're seeing in women's is truly comprehensive as all facets of the business continue to excel, from products to services, from footwear to apparel and across sports and throughout the entire athlete's life. We are excited about the future of the women's business. With the shift towards -- the global shift towards the health and fitness as part of her lifestyle, we see tremendous opportunity for years to come.\r\nNow let's shift on to a few of our key geographies. North America had another great quarter, with revenues up 9% and futures up 15%. This geography continues to drive strong growth across nearly all key categories. Time and time again, even though this is our most developed market, North America proves that the right strategies can drive consistent, profitable growth. The energy of our brand in North America is clear, with continued strong demand across our executions with wholesale partners such as Dick's Sporting Goods, Foot Locker and the Finish Line. We continue to serve this consumer through our amplified strategy, delivering both performance and Lifestyle products. At the same time, we continue to work to effectively manage the flow of inventory in North America, including the impact of the West Coast port congestion from earlier this calendar year. While the flow of product from the port has now returned to normal, we are working to efficiently clear excess inventory to keep our in-line channel healthy.\r\nIn addition, we have recently expanded our North American distribution center and are working to bring this new capacity fully online. We expect both these efforts to be complete by the end of Q3 and inventory levels in North America to normalize at that time. Ultimately, our confidence in the category offense in North America gives us the road map to continue to unlock growth opportunities, both this year and far into the future.\r\nNow let's turn to Western Europe. Q1 revenue grew 14%, driven by growth in all territories and nearly all key categories. This growth continues to be fueled by the transformation of the marketplace along the category offense. This work includes elevated executions at Intersport, the new Oxford Street location with JD Sports in London and the expansion of the House of Hoops of Foot Locker in Berlin. And our own DTC continues to perform very well, delivering 31% growth in Q1.\r\nBy being both deliberate and aggressive, we lead the market as Western Europe's most desired sports brand. We're excited about what the future holds as we execute our complete offense in Western Europe.\r\nNow on to the emerging markets, which delivered strong Q1 results with revenue up 19%, driven by strong growth in Mexico and most key categories. The improvement we've seen in Mexico contributed significantly to the overall results in the geography as we see the benefit of investing in and elevating our distribution. For example, we launched the House for Her [ph] in Mexico City, a product showcase supported by great service, experience and community. Also, prominent marketplace executions with partners such as Liverpool, which is Mexico's largest department store, and Innovasport are also performing well. As these new doors prove, by elevating the marketplace, we grow the market in key geographies and territories. Overall, we believe we are now well positioned to drive profitable, long-term growth in Mexico.\r\nIn Brazil, revenue was flat, an improvement in trend and market share, but still reflective of the continued challenges in the macroeconomic landscape. That said, we continue to focus on our strategy of resetting the marketplace along the category offense. By focusing on differentiating our points of distribution and creating more compelling consumer experiences at retail and online, we drive increased productivity and profitability for NIKE and our wholesale partners. Overall, we continue to see tremendous growth potential for the emerging markets long term and are confident that we are executing the right strategies to realize that potential in this important geography.\r\nFinally, in Greater China, revenue was up an amazing 30%, tremendous growth that again proves, more than ever, the success of our strategies. These gains were driven by strong performance across nearly all key categories, including Sportswear, Running and Basketball. For our wholesale partners like ByLee, the doors that have been reprofiled continue to outperform the rest of the fleet, driving expanded productivity and profitability. We also saw strong growth from our DTC business, driven by comp store sales increases and an acceleration in our e-commerce business.\r\nIt was a very active quarter for China in sports as Beijing hosted the track and field world championships in which athletes wearing NIKE footwear dominated, taking home the majority of medals awarded. And throughout quarter 1, athletes like LeBron James, Kobe, Anthony Davis and Paul George all participated in NIKE Basketball events throughout China, connecting with thousands of consumers through their shared passion of the sport. And just 2 days ago, we announced that Michael Jordan will travel to Shanghai in mid-October to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Air Jordan franchise. All told, the incredible growth we saw in China this quarter reflects our ongoing efforts to align the marketplace to the category offense, a strategy that we expect will drive growth in this critical geography for many years to come.\r\nIn the end, the NIKE Brand started the new fiscal year with energy throughout the entire portfolio of geographies and categories, and we expect to leverage this energy going forward because at NIKE, the opportunities offered by our complete offense are limitless across men's, women's and young athletes and across categories, geographies, product types and also marketplaces.\r\nFiscal year '16 promises to be another year where the choices and investments we make propel us to serve the athlete with even more premium products, services and experiences. While we may be just out of the blocks in quarter 1, we are already in full sprint towards a year of continued growth of this brand and this company.\r\nThanks. And now on his first earnings call as NIKE's new CFO, here is Andy.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Andrew Campion (Executives)】\nThank you, Mark and Trevor, and hello to our stakeholders on the call. I've had the pleasure of meeting many of you over the last several years, and I very much look forward to deeper engagement over time.\r\nWith this being my first earnings call, I'd like to take a moment to reinforce a few of our long-standing guiding principles and also briefly touch on how we will continue to evolve and innovate.\r\nOur primary financial objective has been, and will continue to be, delivering extraordinary value to our shareholders. Delivering value to shareholders is, first and foremost, a function of creating value for consumers. As consumer expectations continue to accelerate, NIKE will evolve and innovate to exceed those expectations. At NIKE, innovation is in our DNA.

As we say at NIKE, there is no finish line.\r\nOur Q1 financial performance and outlook for the balance of the year reflect both the value we are creating for consumers and the principles that we apply to financial management. So I'm very pleased to share our results in more detail.\r\nQ1 reported revenue for NIKE, Inc. increased 5% and grew 14% on a currency-neutral basis. The NIKE Brand grew 15% on a currency-neutral basis and Converse grew 3%. Growth in the NIKE Brand was broad based and strong across all geographies and nearly all categories.\r\nAlso on a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand futures orders grew 17%, driven by an 11% increase in units and a 6% increase in average selling prices.

Our EPS growth was driven by strong top line growth and effective financial management across all levers of the business. Gross margin expanded 90 basis points to 47.5%, primarily driven by higher average selling prices and continued strong growth in our higher-margin Direct-to-Consumer business, partially offset by higher product input cost and warehousing.\r\nQ1 demand creation declined 7%, reflecting favorable comparisons against higher investment in the World Cup in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. Operating overhead increased 10% for the quarter, driven by variable costs associated with continued strong growth in our DTC business and targeted investments in consumer-focused digital capabilities and operational infrastructure.\r\nOur effective tax rate was 18.4% for Q1, lower than prior year, primarily due to an increase in the proportion of earnings from operations outside of the U.S., which are generally subject to a lower tax rate, as well as certain nonrecurring items that were recognized in the first quarter.\r\nAs of August 31, inventories were up 10%, primarily to support strong demand across our business.

And we anticipate there will be an impact on gross margin in the near term as we work to clear excess inventory.\r\nNow let's take a look at our performance by segment. North America delivered another strong quarter, with 9% revenue growth on a currency-neutral basis, driven by strength in nearly every key category, led by Sportswear, Basketball, Men's Training and Running. And consumer demand for NIKE remains strong in North America, with futures growth of 15% on a currency-neutral basis. On a reported basis, North America revenue grew 8% and EBIT grew 7% due to slightly lower gross margin, partially offset by SG&A leverage.\r\nWestern Europe also had a great quarter, with Q1 revenue up 14% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by growth in every territory. These results and our continued momentum in Western Europe reflect our broader and deeper execution of the category offense. Nearly all key categories delivered strong growth, fueled by Sportswear, Basketball and Running, while Global Football declined due to tough comparisons to higher World Cup revenues in the prior year. On a reported basis, Q1 revenue declined 4% due to weakness in the euro. However, EBIT increased 20%, driven by gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.\r\nIn Central and Eastern Europe, Q1 revenue grew 26% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by double-digit growth in every territory except Greece and double-digit growth in nearly every key category. On a reported basis, Q1 revenue grew 2%, reflecting significantly weaker currencies, in particular the ruble and the Turkish lira. However, EBIT grew 42%, due primarily to strong gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.\r\nNow turning to China, where revenue grew an impressive 30% for the quarter on both a reported and currency-neutral basis. While we are very mindful of the macroeconomic volatility in China, our brand has never been stronger and our marketplace has never been more healthy. We have momentum across nearly all key categories as well as continued strength in our DTC business. EBIT for China grew 51% in Q1 due to very strong revenue growth, gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.\r\nIn our emerging markets geography, Q1 revenue increased 19% on a constant currency basis, as nearly all territories delivered strong growth in the quarter, driven by Mexico, Soco and Pacific. Nearly every key category grew for the quarter, led by Sportswear, Action Sports and Basketball.\r\nAs Trevor discussed in his remarks, Mexico returned to strong growth as a result of our efforts to optimize inventory and reset that market. And while revenue was flat in Brazil, our brand is strong and we continue to gain share, while also investing to reset that marketplace along the lines of the category offense.\r\nOn a reported basis, emerging markets revenue increased 3% for the quarter and EBIT rose 65%, reflecting gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.\r\nAt Converse, Q1 revenue grew 3% on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by double-digit growth in the U.S., partially offset by declines in certain European countries, primarily the U.K. The Converse brand remains strong and was further enhanced by the launch of the Chuck II in the first quarter. However, quarterly year-over-year comparisons will be somewhat uneven as we transition to a more direct operating model outside of the U.S. \r\nOn a reported basis, Converse revenue declined 3%, primarily due to the weaker euro. And EBIT decreased 21% for the quarter, driven primarily by lower sales in the U.K. as well as SG&A investments in infrastructure and Converse intellectual property enforcement efforts.\r\nNIKE, Inc. delivered strong financial performance in the first quarter despite significant FX headwinds, and we have healthy momentum across our global portfolio. Our outlook for the balance of the year reflects that momentum as well as continued investment in our growth strategies and operational capabilities. Specifically, for Q2, we expect reported revenue growth at a mid-single-digit rate, generally in line with the growth rate for Q1, reflecting low-teens growth on a currency-neutral basis, largely offset by the impact of the stronger dollar. Our expectations for Q2 revenue also reflect the fact that our futures growth is more heavily weighted towards the back half of the futures window. For the full year, our outlook has slightly improved, but we continue to expect that reported revenue growth will be squarely within the mid-single-digit range.\r\nWe expect gross margin for Q2 to expand by about 25 basis points, reflecting our efforts to expeditiously clear excess inventory in North America and keep the in-line channel fresh. For the full year, we continue to expect gross margin to expand by about 50 basis points, including our stronger-than-expected actual performance in Q1, combined with our current expectations for Q2 and the balance of the year. For total SG&A, we expect Q2 and the full year to grow at a high single-digit rate, reflecting continued investments in DTC, consumer-facing digital capabilities and infrastructure as well as key brand events as we lead up to the Euro Champs and the Summer Olympics in Rio.\r\nWe continue to anticipate other income will have a more meaningful impact on our fiscal year '16 results than we have seen historically, as a portion of our expected FX hedge gains are reported in this line item. Absent significant changes in FX, we continue to expect other income will be about $50 million for each of the next 3 quarters.\r\nWe now expect our effective tax rate will be approximately 22% for the full year, including the lower actual rate in Q1 and an average rate of about 24% for Q2 through Q4. \r\nWith that, we'll now open up for questions.",
      "transcript_text3": "I just got a -- I guess, if I'd like to focus on one area, I don't know, Mark or Trevor, could you guys address -- in China, the results were outstanding. There's just been a lot of headline news around the Chinese consumer, China economy, the currency pieces. I was wondering if you could just elaborate a little bit in terms of the puts and takes that you're seeing in the business from a financial perspective and really how you're seeing such strength, great demand with the futures and the current quarter revenues.\n\n---\n\nYes, Bob, it's a great question. The piece that we continue to look at is the brand in China is extremely strong, and that's the piece that we have known for a while. As we went through the reset strategy, we wanted to be really focused on how to make sure we could drive the business. So we are very mindful of the economic -- the macroeconomic volatility in the marketplace, but we continue to really focus on the things that we can control, which is how we continue to bring excitement to the marketplace and also continue to align the marketplace around our category offense, and we're seeing success from that perspective. So we saw growth in all -- really all key categories, from Sportswear to Running to Basketball. We saw it in our wholesale and also in DTC. In DTC -- our business actually grew 46% in DTC. And then in our wholesale partners' accounts, the stores that have been reprofiled, those doors actually continue to outperform the actual entire fleet, increasing both productivity and profitability. So we feel very, very good about the business and we stay really focused on delivering great product into the marketplace and really driving the category offense.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And I guess just a follow-up question on that. In terms of gauging like industry wholesale inventories, is there -- could you just comment on that a little bit in terms of what you're seeing in the marketplace from -- your own product seems really good in wholesale, but just competitively?\n\n---\n\nYes, and I'll speak to ours. I mean, our -- we have a very healthy position in inventory so we feel good about that. As I said, we continue to really monitor that. And we put a lot of discipline in places we went through the reset, and we continue to employ that discipline across the organization. So we are in good shape.\n\n---\n\nMy first question is on North America inventories. Just wondered if you could give a little bit more detail on the composition of the inventory elevation by category and by channel. And how long do you expect this to put some pressure on gross profit margins?\n\n---\n\nYes. As I think -- as we discussed in the prepared remarks, the brand, again, in North America is very strong and demand for our products continues to be very strong in the marketplace. What we're working through is the impact of the West Coast port congestion from earlier this year. And what we have done is we've seen the actual flow of product from the port normalize. At the same time, we're working to efficiently clear the excess inventory to keep the in-line channel healthy. And we also put on our own North American distribution center, and we are working to actually put that capacity in place, and that will be fully online. We expect both of those efforts to be complete by the end of Q3, and that's really where we are around it. So again, we continue to feel very confident about the business in North America. And this is obviously a very well-developed market where we have the ability to efficiently clear the inventory.\n\n---\n\nAnd all I'd add, Kate, is that as we work to expeditiously clear that inventory, you do see that impacting our Q2 gross margin guidance. That is just a near-term impact.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Very helpful. My second question is on the supply chain and also a gross margin question. Just with all the investment that you've made into the supply chain and the effort to make the process more automated with your factory partners, when do you expect to see cost become less of a meaningful offset to gross margin?\n\n---\n\nYes, Kate, we -- from a supply chain perspective, obviously, our manufacturing revolution initiatives, we believe, will create tremendous value for us over the long term. Those initiatives range from initiatives that are more evolutionary such as optimizing product costs, reducing waste, getting productivity enhancements through lean, and then as you touched on, automation, to the more revolutionary initiatives like new methods of design and make, and Flyknit is a great example of that. We are beginning to see some of the benefits of those initiatives in margin but it's early stages. We are still very optimistic about those benefits over the long term.\n\n---\n\nI wanted to ask a question on SG&A demand creation. I think it was down 6% or 7% this quarter, and I think you were expecting it to be down. I wondered if there's any kind of underlying change in trend or attitude towards demand creation. I know you've got some events coming up. And then broader picture on demand creation investment, SG&A investment, when we take out the currency out of the equation and you look at just the total gross profit dollar growth, it's at such a high rate looking forward in the business right now. Is there -- did you -- are there enough -- are there ample investment opportunities to keep the SG&A investment level in line with that revenue and gross profit dollar growth that you're seeing? It just seems like a really big number to keep up with on the investment side.\n\n---\n\nYes. Omar, I'll hit that question, first, in terms of demand creation. Q1, the biggest driver of what you saw in Q1 was comparisons to the World Cup investment in the prior year. As we have spoken about in the past, there are some dynamics in SG&A across demand creation and operating overhead. That has changed. Those aren't drivers of some of the impact in Q1, that is more along the lines of how we engage with consumers. I think we have spoken to you about that over time that how we engage with consumers now expands into things that fall into that line item, operating overhead. In terms of SG&A, as you know, we look to deliver modest SG&A leverage over the long term. But in any given period, our actual investment may be higher or lower. Our guidance for this year reflects continuing to make investments in consumer engagement that we believe drive great returns from a revenue and margin perspective. One example of that would be in NIKE.com. We're also continuing to make infrastructure investments that we believe are required to support the growth that we're delivering and we're delivering on a consistent basis and, at the same time, enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations. We are also increasing the productivity of our existing resources and infrastructure. So we do see greater productivity going forward and currently from our existing resources. That does add, as you noted, potentially to profit expansion. It also gives us greater capacity to invest strategically.\n\n---\n\nI guess, Andy, a question for you. When you mentioned, with regard to the guidance on the year, about feeling better about the revenue growth rate yet you're still looking for a reported mid-single digit, just maybe you can walk through that. Is it just based on a currency-neutral basis you feel better about the revenue growth? Or just maybe you can walk through that a little bit, even though you're up 9% on the futures number on a reported basis.\n\n---\n\nYes, a couple of things. We -- the headline from a revenue perspective is we do see strong demand around the globe. You see that reflected in our futures. I did note in my remarks and I'll reiterate it, that our futures are weighted more heavily toward the back half of the window. As for our full year expectations, I think I also noted but just to reiterate it, our outlook is slightly improved. It's just that from a reported basis, our guidance is still squarely within that mid-single-digit range.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Fair enough. And then I'm curious, Western Europe continues to put up really good performance, and I'm just really want to deep -- go a little bit further into the margin performance, which was really strong even against a tough comparison from last year. I mean, is it just a function of the execution on the category offense, the product, the pricing? Maybe just talk a little bit more about that and maybe the sustainability at that level, if you could.\n\n---\n\nChris, are you talking about operating, like EBIT margin?\n\n---\n\nRevenue growth a bit, yes, but a little bit of both. Revenue growth and, I guess, more specifically, the operating margin being at that level, which we haven't seen in some time, and the sustainability around that.\n\n---\n\nYes. So I'll just jump in there just to say, again, as you pointed out, we are seeing great results out of Western Europe, and it really goes back to the work that we did to reset the marketplace along the line of the category offense. We're seeing great growth in the territories. So whether it's AGS, which is Austria, Germany and Switzerland; Southern Europe; U.K. and Ireland; as well as France, all of those territories are performing well. We're also seeing strong growth across the categories from Sportswear, Basketball to Running. So when you look at it from different dimensions, what we are seeing is just strong demand in the marketplace. And then we're also continuing to work with our wholesale partners to deliver the category offense in the marketplace, and that's working real well. So all the dimensions that we're seeing continue to point to just really strong demand, really strong positioning with our consumers, and we've been able to really translate that into the business.\n\n---\n\nI'll just quickly add, we're seeing incredible brand strength, too, across the major cities across Europe. And I think that's helping as well. The products that we've been introducing to the market have resonated. Sell-throughs are strong. Western Europe is a great example of a complete offense. Not just the category offense working but the complete offense. So we really feel good about executing across the categories up and down the price point spectrum and across the major channels as well.\n\n---\n\nTrevor, I was hoping you could talk about the Jordan Brand, maybe remind us how big it is. And then I think the commentary on the new areas for the Jordan Brand is really interesting. Can you give us some insight on what these areas could be, how soon we could see things happening, how that's going to play out for you with partners at retail and in your own stores? Anything you can give us on that would be great.\n\n---\n\nYes. The Jordan Brand continues to be, obviously, a key part of our Basketball strategy. And as you know, we don't actually report specifically the size of the Jordan business today. But what I can say is that we continue to see tremendous success in the marketplace. So this summer in Paris, for example, the team was there, really executing the anniversary of the Jordan business. Michael actually went over there. I think he's going to go over into Shanghai also. So it is a sense of a global phenomenon that we're seeing as really just driving great sell-through and just great demand for the products and the brand. At the same time, we see an opportunity around the Training business, which is -- as I think Mark spoke to, which is we are expanding the business beyond Basketball into the Training segment. And so that's another area that we continue to see opportunity and potential growth around the world.\n\n---\n\nJordan -- I just want to add, Jordan is a tremendous brand globally. It's not just a subset of NIKE Basketball, it is a standalone brand with tremendous potential to resonate beyond Basketball as a category. So it's largely been Basketball-based and that will always be the core of the Jordan Brand. With that, though, we see tremendous opportunity to expand that brand not just here in North America but around the world.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And just my second question, the North America apparel growth, what channels are leading your apparel growth in North America? Is D2C accelerating in NIKE apparel? Or is it department stores? I'd just love to get a sense of how you guys are driving such great growth.\n\n---\n\nYes, again, our apparel business continues to strengthen, and we're seeing growth really across different segments within the category offense. So for instance, our Running business continues to be a great growth driver. Our Sportswear business with our Tech Pack products just continue to be really successful. And as you pointed out, we're also seeing great growth in our own DTC doors and also online, which are really just key elements. The other part that we do talk a lot about, which is the women's business, and so you're seeing great growth come from women's business. So again, dimensionally, through the category offense, we are able to really grow our apparel business really across a broad spectrum of the marketplace, but it is driven by our ability to drive a complete offense through the category offense.\n\n---\n\nI wanted to -- I was hoping, as we think about the Olympics ahead, if you guys could sort of put into context how you think about the Olympics as a platform to introduce new products and maybe just give us an historic context for where you have particular success.\n\n---\n\nWell, clearly, the Olympics are a great sport moment for the world but, certainly, for NIKE. These global event at this scale, I mean, the Olympics and the World Cup really stand above and beyond all sports events. And for us, they're sort of an opportunity to really bring our best product, our best innovation, our best storytelling out, serve the athletes to the highest level. The expectations I think on NIKE are extraordinarily high, as they should be. I think this year we will not disappoint. I feel incredibly confident and excited, frankly, about the innovation pipeline, what's in the works, excited about sharing some of that later in the fiscal year with everyone. But I think this Olympics will be one of the best, if not really the best ever for NIKE. I've never seen an innovation pipeline so full. And we'll be ready. I mean, first and foremost, for the athletes but also the consumer and the shareholder. I think everybody's going to benefit from our performance at the Olympics.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And maybe just a follow-up on pricing. Can you update us on how much pricing you were able to take this quarter and how we should be thinking about your approach to pricing over the next few quarters?\n\n---\n\nSure. I'll take that one, Lindsay. In the first quarter, we do not report that number at this stage. But in the first quarter, our pricing increases were about what you've seen over the recent quarters. So we continue to see average gross selling price growing in the low to mid-single-digit range. You see that in our futures, so that is also a proxy for that rate. And the way we think about pricing, I think we start first with the consumer. Our approach is to enhance the price value equation for consumers with innovation, design, inspiration and, increasingly, service that expands that average gross selling price. We have not seen any resistance to that from consumers overall. Certainly, within our broad portfolio, there are greater opportunities than in other areas. But we've seen consumers demonstrate a willingness to trade up for the innovation, design, inspiration and service that we're bringing.\n\n---\n\nI might have missed it, if you -- did you give the comp store sales in North America? And I apologize if I did miss that.\n\n---\n\nI'm not sure that we did, but comp store sales in North America were low single-digits in the quarter.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And I'm trying to correlate that, I guess, with a -- I guess, the EBIT margin in the U.S. was a little lower and you talked us through some of the inventory. I'm trying to think if that's related to some of the inventory clearing activities, the slight deceleration in the same-store sales number in North America, and if -- I guess maybe if you think that the EBIT margins are -- will still expand after you guys finish getting the DC up and running and get through some of the West Coast inventory.\n\n---\n\nYes. I think you definitely -- your inference is correct. The flow of inventory can impact revenue growth at the store level, certainly, in the near term. Obviously, as we work expeditiously to clear some inventory, that will also impact margin.\n\n---\n\nGot it. Okay. And then just a question on -- as we think about your Direct business and your e-commerce business, obviously, it's been a great growth business for you. But if we look -- maybe if you look at a single category, Running or Basketball, just as an example, can you talk a little bit how you balance the strategy there as far as what product you want presented on your own e-commerce site versus what you choose to have presented on your wholesale partner site? Even if you think about some of your pinnacle distribution, which is I know a big focus for you on your own sites, how do you think about the difference and what product is best represented where and how we should think about the overlap between the 2?\n\n---\n\nYes. I think, as we said a number of times, we really view ourselves as being a better retailer so we can be a better wholesale partner. So what we do is we actually drive what we call our integrated marketplace strategy, and that is a sense of working to differentiate the points of distribution through some of our wholesale partners, through some of the concepts that we have, whether it's House of Hoops, with Foot Locker or it's the Finish -- the Chelsea Collective we're doing with Finish Line. All of those are opportunities for us to provide with the -- sorry, are opportunities for us to provide really great, different experiences there. When you go online, our business continues to grow really at an accelerated rate. And certainly, we are seeing a dimension of the business, particularly the women's business, is growing at a faster rate than our overall business, and also our men's business. That's really where we really see just tremendous growth, and that's kind of how we differentiate it. It's actually through the concepts that we actually do in the marketplace.\n\n---\n\nOperator, we have time for one more question.\n\n---\n\nAndy, a question for you. The gross margin expansion in overseas regions is impressive given the FX headwinds. Can you talk to some of the factors supporting that? And is pricing a key variable there? Or are there other dynamics behind it?\n\n---\n\nYes. You're speaking specifically to gross margin or to operating margin?\n\n---\n\nSpeaking to gross margin in overseas markets. You mentioned in your prepared remarks expansion in Europe, in China and emerging markets. Given the FX headwinds, I find that impressive.\n\n---\n\nYes. We're actually seeing very common trends. And by trends, I don't mean fleeting, I mean long-term trends across the globe. We're proud of the gross margin expansion that we've delivered consistently over the past several years and we believe that we can sustain those longer term. And that's not only with respect to select markets, that's really a reflection of our strategy. Our strategy is to bring innovation to the product and to be premium, premium overall and premium at every price point. So no, there are not unique factors relative to any particular market. We're continuing to see great demand at these prices, which we feel great about because it's reflective of what we're bringing to the product.\n\n---\n\nAnd to be clear, have you taken any adjustments to prices in overseas markets to try to manage the gross margin?\n\n---\n\nIn reaction to what's going on from a foreign exchange perspective, not directly. The way we think about it is we're very well positioned to deliver growth and profitability all-in under a wide range of circumstances, including FX volatility. We have a very sophisticated foreign exchange risk management program and a trading company structure that afford us the time to plan fully and strategically execute the same way we would absent the volatility. It gives us time to do that and to stay on strategy. So not directly related. Of course, in certain inflationary markets, that can have an impact on price. But no, not directly correlated to foreign exchange.\n\n---\n\nGreat. All right. Well, thank you, everyone. I appreciate you joining us on this call, and we'll talk to you next quarter.",

And this is obviously a very well-developed market where we have the ability to efficiently clear the inventory.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Andrew Campion (Executives)】\nAnd all I'd add, Kate, is that as we work to expeditiously clear that inventory, you do see that impacting our Q2 gross margin guidance.

We are still very optimistic about those benefits over the long term.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Omar Saad (Analysts)】\nI wanted to ask a question on SG&A demand creation. I think it was down 6% or 7% this quarter, and I think you were expecting it to be down. I wondered if there's any kind of underlying change in trend or attitude towards demand creation. I know you've got some events coming up. And then broader picture on demand creation investment, SG&A investment, when we take out the currency out of the equation and you look at just the total gross profit dollar growth, it's at such a high rate looking forward in the business right now. Is there -- did you -- are there enough -- are there ample investment opportunities to keep the SG&A investment level in line with that revenue and gross profit dollar growth that you're seeing? It just seems like a really big number to keep up with on the investment side.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Andrew Campion (Executives)】\nYes. Omar, I'll hit that question, first, in terms of demand creation. Q1, the biggest driver of what you saw in Q1 was comparisons to the World Cup investment in the prior year. As we have spoken about in the past, there are some dynamics in SG&A across demand creation and operating overhead. That has changed. Those aren't drivers of some of the impact in Q1, that is more along the lines of how we engage with consumers. I think we have spoken to you about that over time that how we engage with consumers now expands into things that fall into that line item, operating overhead. In terms of SG&A, as you know, we look to deliver modest SG&A leverage over the long term. But in any given period, our actual investment may be higher or lower. Our guidance for this year reflects continuing to make investments in consumer engagement that we believe drive great returns from a revenue and margin perspective. One example of that would be in NIKE.com. We're also continuing to make infrastructure investments that we believe are required to support the growth that we're delivering and we're delivering on a consistent basis and, at the same time, enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations. We are also increasing the productivity of our existing resources and infrastructure. So we do see greater productivity going forward and currently from our existing resources. That does add, as you noted, potentially to profit expansion. It also gives us greater capacity to invest strategically.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Christopher Svezia (Analysts)】\nI guess, Andy, a question for you. When you mentioned, with regard to the guidance on the year, about feeling better about the revenue growth rate yet you're still looking for a reported mid-single digit, just maybe you can walk through that. Is it just based on a currency-neutral basis you feel better about the revenue growth?

We -- the headline from a revenue perspective is we do see strong demand around the globe. You see that reflected in our futures. I did note in my remarks and I'll reiterate it, that our futures are weighted more heavily toward the back half of the window. As for our full year expectations, I think I also noted but just to reiterate it, our outlook is slightly improved. It's just that from a reported basis, our guidance is still squarely within that mid-single-digit range.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Christopher Svezia (Analysts)】\nOkay. Fair enough. And then I'm curious, Western Europe continues to put up really good performance, and I'm just really want to deep -- go a little bit further into the margin performance, which was really strong even against a tough comparison from last year. I mean, is it just a function of the execution on the category offense, the product, the pricing? Maybe just talk a little bit more about that and maybe the sustainability at that level, if you could.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kelley Hall (Executives)】\nChris, are you talking about operating, like EBIT margin?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Christopher Svezia (Analysts)】\nRevenue growth a bit, yes, but a little bit of both. Revenue growth and, I guess, more specifically, the operating margin being at that level, which we haven't seen in some time, and the sustainability around that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Trevor Edwards (Executives)】\nYes. So I'll just jump in there just to say, again, as you pointed out, we are seeing great results out of Western Europe, and it really goes back to the work that we did to reset the marketplace along the line of the category offense. We're seeing great growth in the territories. So whether it's AGS, which is Austria, Germany and Switzerland; Southern Europe; U.K. and Ireland; as well as France, all of those territories are performing well. We're also seeing strong growth across the categories from Sportswear, Basketball to Running. So when you look at it from different dimensions, what we are seeing is just strong demand in the marketplace. And then we're also continuing to work with our wholesale partners to deliver the category offense in the marketplace, and that's working real well. So all the dimensions that we're seeing continue to point to just really strong demand, really strong positioning with our consumers, and we've been able to really translate that into the business.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Parker (Executives)】\nI'll just quickly add, we're seeing incredible brand strength, too, across the major cities across Europe. And I think that's helping as well. The products that we've been introducing to the market have resonated. Sell-throughs are strong. Western Europe is a great example of a complete offense. Not just the category offense working but the complete offense. So we really feel good about executing across the categories up and down the price point spectrum and across the major channels as well.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Ohmes (Analysts)】\nTrevor, I was hoping you could talk about the Jordan Brand, maybe remind us how big it is. And then I think the commentary on the new areas for the Jordan Brand is really interesting. Can you give us some insight on what these areas could be, how soon we could see things happening, how that's going to play out for you with partners at retail and in your own stores? Anything you can give us on that would be great.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Trevor Edwards (Executives)】\nYes. The Jordan Brand continues to be, obviously, a key part of our Basketball strategy. And as you know, we don't actually report specifically the size of the Jordan business today. But what I can say is that we continue to see tremendous success in the marketplace. So this summer in Paris, for example, the team was there, really executing the anniversary of the Jordan business. Michael actually went over there. I think he's going to go over into Shanghai also. So it is a sense of a global phenomenon that we're seeing as really just driving great sell-through and just great demand for the products and the brand. At the same time, we see an opportunity around the Training business, which is -- as I think Mark spoke to, which is we are expanding the business beyond Basketball into the Training segment. And so that's another area that we continue to see opportunity and potential growth around the world.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Parker (Executives)】\nJordan -- I just want to add, Jordan is a tremendous brand globally. It's not just a subset of NIKE Basketball, it is a standalone brand with tremendous potential to resonate beyond Basketball as a category. So it's largely been Basketball-based and that will always be the core of the Jordan Brand. With that, though, we see tremendous opportunity to expand that brand not just here in North America but around the world.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Ohmes (Analysts)】\nGreat. And just my second question, the North America apparel growth, what channels are leading your apparel growth in North America? Is D2C accelerating in NIKE apparel? Or is it department stores? I'd just love to get a sense of how you guys are driving such great growth.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Trevor Edwards (Executives)】\nYes, again, our apparel business continues to strengthen, and we're seeing growth really across different segments within the category offense. So for instance, our Running business continues to be a great growth driver. Our Sportswear business with our Tech Pack products just continue to be really successful. And as you pointed out, we're also seeing great growth in our own DTC doors and also online, which are really just key elements. The other part that we do talk a lot about, which is the women's business, and so you're seeing great growth come from women's business. So again, dimensionally, through the category offense, we are able to really grow our apparel business really across a broad spectrum of the marketplace, but it is driven by our ability to drive a complete offense through the category offense.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Lindsay Mann (Analysts)】\nI wanted to -- I was hoping, as we think about the Olympics ahead, if you guys could sort of put into context how you think about the Olympics as a platform to introduce new products and maybe just give us an historic context for where you have particular success.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Parker (Executives)】\nWell, clearly, the Olympics are a great sport moment for the world but, certainly, for NIKE. These global event at this scale, I mean, the Olympics and the World Cup really stand above and beyond all sports events. And for us, they're sort of an opportunity to really bring our best product, our best innovation, our best storytelling out, serve the athletes to the highest level. The expectations I think on NIKE are extraordinarily high, as they should be. I think this year we will not disappoint. I feel incredibly confident and excited, frankly, about the innovation pipeline, what's in the works, excited about sharing some of that later in the fiscal year with everyone. But I think this Olympics will be one of the best, if not really the best ever for NIKE. I've never seen an innovation pipeline so full. And we'll be ready. I mean, first and foremost, for the athletes but also the consumer and the shareholder. I think everybody's going to benefit from our performance at the Olympics.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Lindsay Mann (Analysts)】\nGreat. And maybe just a follow-up on pricing. Can you update us on how much pricing you were able to take this quarter and how we should be thinking about your approach to pricing over the next few quarters?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Andrew Campion (Executives)】\nSure. I'll take that one, Lindsay. In the first quarter, we do not report that number at this stage. But in the first quarter, our pricing increases were about what you've seen over the recent quarters. So we continue to see average gross selling price growing in the low to mid-single-digit range. You see that in our futures, so that is also a proxy for that rate. And the way we think about pricing, I think we start first with the consumer. Our approach is to enhance the price value equation for consumers with innovation, design, inspiration and, increasingly, service that expands that average gross selling price. We have not seen any resistance to that from consumers overall. Certainly, within our broad portfolio, there are greater opportunities than in other areas. But we've seen consumers demonstrate a willingness to trade up for the innovation, design, inspiration and service that we're bringing.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Binetti (Analysts)】\nI might have missed it, if you -- did you give the comp store sales in North America? And I apologize if I did miss that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Andrew Campion (Executives)】\nI'm not sure that we did, but comp store sales in North America were low single-digits in the quarter.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Binetti (Analysts)】\nOkay. And I'm trying to correlate that, I guess, with a -- I guess, the EBIT margin in the U.S. was a little lower and you talked us through some of the inventory. I'm trying to think if that's related to some of the inventory clearing activities, the slight deceleration in the same-store sales number in North America, and if -- I guess maybe if you think that the EBIT margins are -- will still expand after you guys finish getting the DC up and running and get through some of the West Coast inventory.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Andrew Campion (Executives)】\nYes. I think you definitely -- your inference is correct. The flow of inventory can impact revenue growth at the store level, certainly, in the near term. Obviously, as we work expeditiously to clear some inventory, that will also impact margin.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Binetti (Analysts)】\nGot it. Okay. And then just a question on -- as we think about your Direct business and your e-commerce business, obviously, it's been a great growth business for you. But if we look -- maybe if you look at a single category, Running or Basketball, just as an example, can you talk a little bit how you balance the strategy there as far as what product you want presented on your own e-commerce site versus what you choose to have presented on your wholesale partner site? Even if you think about some of your pinnacle distribution, which is I know a big focus for you on your own sites, how do you think about the difference and what product is best represented where and how we should think about the overlap between the 2?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Trevor Edwards (Executives)】\nYes. I think, as we said a number of times, we really view ourselves as being a better retailer so we can be a better wholesale partner. So what we do is we actually drive what we call our integrated marketplace strategy, and that is a sense of working to differentiate the points of distribution through some of our wholesale partners, through some of the concepts that we have, whether it's House of Hoops, with Foot Locker or it's the Finish -- the Chelsea Collective we're doing with Finish Line. All of those are opportunities for us to provide with the -- sorry, are opportunities for us to provide really great, different experiences there. When you go online, our business continues to grow really at an accelerated rate. And certainly, we are seeing a dimension of the business, particularly the women's business, is growing at a faster rate than our overall business, and also our men's business. That's really where we really see just tremendous growth, and that's kind of how we differentiate it. It's actually through the concepts that we actually do in the marketplace.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kelley Hall (Executives)】\nOperator, we have time for one more question.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jim Duffy (Analysts)】\nAndy, a question for you. The gross margin expansion in overseas regions is impressive given the FX headwinds. Can you talk to some of the factors supporting that? And is pricing a key variable there? Or are there other dynamics behind it?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Andrew Campion (Executives)】\nYes. You're speaking specifically to gross margin or to operating margin?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jim Duffy (Analysts)】\nSpeaking to gross margin in overseas markets. You mentioned in your prepared remarks expansion in Europe, in China and emerging markets. Given the FX headwinds, I find that impressive.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Andrew Campion (Executives)】\nYes. We're actually seeing very common trends. And by trends, I don't mean fleeting, I mean long-term trends across the globe. We're proud of the gross margin expansion that we've delivered consistently over the past several years and we believe that we can sustain those longer term. And that's not only with respect to select markets, that's really a reflection of our strategy. Our strategy is to bring innovation to the product and to be premium, premium overall and premium at every price point. So no, there are not unique factors relative to any particular market. We're continuing to see great demand at these prices, which we feel great about because it's reflective of what we're bringing to the product.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jim Duffy (Analysts)】\nAnd to be clear, have you taken any adjustments to prices in overseas markets to try to manage the gross margin?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Andrew Campion (Executives)】\nIn reaction to what's going on from a foreign exchange perspective, not directly. The way we think about it is we're very well positioned to deliver growth and profitability all-in under a wide range of circumstances, including FX volatility. We have a very sophisticated foreign exchange risk management program and a trading company structure that afford us the time to plan fully and strategically execute the same way we would absent the volatility. It gives us time to do that and to stay on strategy. So not directly related. Of course, in certain inflationary markets, that can have an impact on price. But no, not directly correlated to foreign exchange.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kelley Hall (Executives)】\nGreat. All right. Well, thank you, everyone. I appreciate you joining us on this call, and we'll talk to you next quarter.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle's First Quarter Fiscal Year 2016 Earnings Conference Call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information, can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website. On the call today are Executive Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison; and CEOs Safra Catz and Mark Hurd.\r\nAs a reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today's discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business, which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements.\r\nThese forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements being made today. As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, and we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments, for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock.\r\nAnd finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or publicly release any revision to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we'll begin with some prepared remarks. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Safra. Safra?\n\n---\n\nSorry about that. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks, Ken. I am actually offsite today, so hopefully this phone will work out. If you don't hear me, I may have to reconnect so -- but I do have, obviously, Ken Bond on the call and Corey West, our Chief Accounting Officer, is also, I think, in the room with Larry and Mark.\r\nI'm going to focus today on our non-GAAP results for Q1. I'll then review guidance for Q2, and I will actually give some guidance for the entire fiscal year. And then I'll turn the call over to Mark and Larry for their comments.\r\nAs you know, we didn't provide you a stellar guidance for Q1, given the high volatility in exchange rates we were seeing at the time. As it happened, Q1 currency headwinds were actually 2% worse than we expected. The currency impact for both total revenue and hardware revenue ended up being 9%. And for software and cloud revenue, it was 8%.\r\nNow we do get benefit on the expense side, but because many of our expenses are in the United States, we get a very small benefit and, of course, our expenses are significantly lower than our revenues, and so our operating income was actually impacted by 12 points.\r\nEarnings per share was $0.06 lower because of currency, $0.01 worse than we anticipated. With currency still volatile, we will continue to use constant dollar growth rates on our quarterly calls so we can have some measure of consistency and also share with you how we look at the business.\r\nWe've also changed the presentation of our income statement to better reflect how we look at the company now that cloud has become a significant contributor to revenue. Our software business is really 2 parts of 1 business: the on-premise software business, which is steady and growing modestly; and the cloud business that is in a high-growth phase. We felt it made sense to show the components grouped together in our income statement to make it easier to see the progress we are making in the cloud.\r\nThe largest part is on-premise software revenue, which is made up of new software licenses plus software license updates and product support. On-premise software revenue was up 4% for the quarter to $5.8 billion. The largest component is software license updates and product support, which was up 8% for the quarter to $4.7 billion, with attach and renewal rates running at their usual high levels. We expect the on-premise software business to remain steady. Over the full year, I expect we will see modest growth comprised of continued growth in software support revenue that offsets any declines in new software license.\r\nMoving on to cloud. We start with SaaS and PaaS and then add Infrastructure as a Service to report total cloud revenues, which were up 34%. Within the cloud business, we continue to see excellent momentum in SaaS and PaaS, with bookings growth of 165% this quarter on top of the 54% growth from Q1 of last year.\r\nSaaS and PaaS revenue was $452 million, up 38% from last year. The triple-digit bookings growth that we have been experiencing will translate into significant acceleration in SaaS and PaaS revenue in the second half of the year. You can also see the coming revenue acceleration of our cloud business in the SaaS and PaaS billings and deferred revenue. SaaS and PaaS billings grew 70% in U.S. dollars this quarter on top of the 100% growth last quarter. Also, the gross deferred revenue balance is now nearly $1 billion and was up more than 100%. We've put the billings numbers up on the website for you to see in detail.\r\nOur significant success in cloud bookings will not only help accelerate our revenue growth, but it will also benefit our margins and earnings over time. Cloud revenue, as you know, is recognized ratably while new license is recognized all upfront. This timing difference has the effect of lowering near-term operating margins and earnings per share but, over time, will increase both.\r\nAs our SaaS and PaaS bookings have continued to accelerate, capital expenditures for the quarter were higher compared to last year. The bulk of them are largely complete, and you can see this in the $150 million sequential decline in CapEx this quarter. I expect CapEx for this year will be materially lower than last year as we utilize the investments that we have already made.\r\nWe are well aware of the near-term impact to gross margins that this build-out cost has had on the cloud business, and I think that Q4 of last year marks the bottom for SaaS and PaaS gross margins. Q1 cloud gross margins were up slightly on a sequential basis, and I think we'll see another modest improvement in Q2. But as our cloud business scales up, we expect SaaS and PaaS gross margins will be around 60% by Q4 and then 80% over the next 2 years.\r\nThe balance of our cloud revenue comes from cloud Infrastructure as a Service, which was up 23% to $160 million. The gross margin in this business was up sequentially to a record 45%. While SaaS and PaaS revenue will see much higher growth rates, along with significantly higher gross margins, we expect Infrastructure as a Service revenues will grow at a single-digit rate and maintain a steady margin profile over time.\r\nAs I mentioned, there are 2 parts to our software business that can be looked at separately but should really be considered together: the on-premise software business, which will grow modestly and serves as a tremendous base of loyal customers using our leading product; the SaaS and PaaS revenues will grow rapidly and will quickly become a significant contributor to revenues and profit as we help those same customers transform their businesses over time. In total, we will see growth in the total software business begin to increase this year as cloud revenue grows as a percentage of the total software business.\r\nFinally, total hardware revenues grew 6%, which included hardware products revenue of $570 million and hardware support revenue of $559 million. Total revenue for the quarter was up 7% from last year to $8.5 billion.\r\nNon-GAAP operating income was $3.5 billion and the operating margin was 41%. Sales and cloud investments, along with the integration of MICROS, each impacted operating margins negatively by about 1%. A non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter -- the non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 25%, which was 3.5 points higher than last year. The GAAP tax rate was 24.4%, which was 5 points higher than last year. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.53 in U.S. dollars, and GAAP EPS was $0.40 in U.S. dollars. As I said earlier, both were $0.06 lower due to currency. Free cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $11.8 billion.\r\nWe now have nearly $56 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is approximately $14 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $9.1 billion, up 10% in constant currency. This quarter, we repurchased more than 75 million shares for a total of $3 billion, up from our fiscal year '15 run rate of $2 billion a quarter. And given current market conditions, we expect to buy even more in Q2.\r\nThe Board of Directors also declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased more than 220 million shares for a total of $9.1 billion and paid out dividends of $2.4 billion for a total that is nearly 100% of free cash flow.\r\nNow to the guidance. As I mentioned, I'm going to give you guidance for Q2 and then for the whole year. We feel very good about the progress of our cloud transition, and clearly, customers are migrating to the Oracle cloud. Over time, we expect the cloud will result in more revenue and profit for Oracle as we take share from legacy, on-premise competitors, other cloud competitors who are limited to point solutions and the labor suppliers who can't possibly offer what we have already built.\r\nOf course, I am seeing many of the same financial news reports that all of you are about the whole world, and so I think it is still best to be prudent here. Additionally, we expect to see continued volatility in exchange rates and significant currency headwinds.\r\nI'm going to give you constant currency guidance, but if exchange rates remain the same as they are right now, we expect to see a currency headwind of about 6% on revenue and $0.05 on earnings per share. But again, it could be significantly worse. Maybe if we're lucky, it could be a little bit better. All of my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. So here goes.\r\nSaaS and PaaS revenue is expected to grow 36% to 40%. Cloud IaaS revenue is expected to grow 5% to 9%. Total cloud and on-premise software is expected to grow from 0 to 2%. Total revenue is expected to range from a negative 2 to a positive 1.\r\nNon-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be somewhere between $0.63 and $0.66. Now this assumes a non-GAAP tax rate of 25.5%. Of course, if this quarter is any example, it may end up being different. Looking further out, we expect to see a material acceleration in SaaS and PaaS revenue. As a result, I'm providing full fiscal year guidance for some key items. As before, my guidance on the full year is in constant currency.\r\nSaaS and PaaS revenue is expected to grow around 50%. On-premise software is expected to grow approximately 1%. Total cloud and on-premise software is expected to grow between 3% and 4%. Finally, SaaS and PaaS gross margins are expected to materially improve in the second half and exit the year at around 60%.\r\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Larry and Mark for their comments.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Safra. This is Larry. Over the last 3 years, we've been in the start-up phase of our cloud business. We've developed services at all 4 layers of the cloud, a complete set of enterprise SaaS applications, plus our database and middleware platform services, plus compute and storage infrastructure services and an expanding set of data services.\r\nWe have deployed those cloud services in 19 data centers and 14 countries around the world. During this start-up phase of our cloud business, we have increased our data center service delivery capacity from 0.5 megawatt to 45 megawatts. That's a 90x, not 90%, a 90x increase in our data center capacity in 3 years. We've installed over 40,000 physical devices, 100,000 virtual machines and over 8 petabytes of storage.\r\nWe now have in place the physical infrastructure to dramatically expand our cloud customer base. We are entering the rapid growth, scale-out phase of our cloud business. We're adding thousands of new SaaS, PaaS, IaaS and data customers to our existing data centers. With all that customer growth on top of our existing infrastructure, we expect that our cloud margins will double from 40% to 80% over the next 2 years. Mark, it's your turn to tell everybody about all those great customer adds we had during Q1.\n\n---\n\nThanks. By the process of elimination, this is Mark actually speaking. So I thought I'd do 2 things right to Larry's point, tell you about some wins but also give you some facts about the quarter.\r\nRevenue grew 38% year-on-year, 8% quarter-on-quarter. Billings grew 70%, again growing much faster than Salesforce and Workday. Bookings were USD 191 million, 165% growth. And like I always do, I want to tell you the number of customers we added. We added 612 new SaaS customers in the quarter, brand new logos. 616 expanded their SaaS business with us in the quarter.\r\nIn HCM, it was 166 new customers, more than double what Workday had. In CX, 280 customers. In ERP EPM, it was 200 customers, double last year. That is also more than Workday's lifetime sales. We now have 1,350 customers in our installed base. More than 300 are already live, including 100 that went live in just Q1.\r\nWhat's taken Workday 8 quarters to do, we did in 1 quarter. We never see SAP. PaaS, we added 800 new PaaS customers in the quarter. 2,500 in just 2 quarters. Bookings over $65 million. Now I think we have a shot in Q2 to book more PaaS than we actually did in Q4. I think we have a shot. That's how fast we see our pipeline growing in PaaS.\r\nI'm going to wrap up and then I'm going to read you some wins, but I just want to connect a few dots between what Safra and Larry described on the Oracle SaaS, PaaS cloud. We're currently at a $1.8 billion run rate in revenue. If you include IaaS, it's $2.4 billion, we will book between $1.5 billion and $2 billion in SaaS, PaaS ARRs in the fiscal year.\r\nGross deferred revenue has grown from $475 million to nearly $1 billion in the year. Billings are growing 70%. Gross margins are headed to 80%. SaaS, PaaS will be a very large and very profitable business for Oracle.\r\nNow in addition, I just want to give you some brands that we got in the quarter just so you have a feeling for who these -- all these people are that are buying solutions from us. So first, let me get HCM. A few wins. CMiC. They're an Australia Fusion HCM. We replaced Workday at CMiC in the quarter. Cypress Semiconductor, GDF SUEZ, Limited Brands, Nationwide Insurance, Restoration Hardware, Rutgers University. \r\nWe expanded our HCM Cloud at OMNICare, the Navy, Westpac Bank. In ERP EPM, AthenaHealth, Chicago Sun-Times. These are all new customers by the way. Fox Home Entertainment, U.S. Department of Energy, LendingClub Corp, Lenovo, LG Electronics, Rutgers University. By the way, you'll hear a few names twice, which is because they bought multiple pillars at the same time.\r\nIn sales service cloud, Fox Home Entertainment, Royal Mail, Sallie Mae, SIRIUS XM, Toshiba Medical, Wesfarmers, expansions at Cigna, Motorola, Nikon, Polycom, Virgin Atlantic, Westpac.\r\nIn our marketing cloud, Aer Lingus, General Mills, Jeanswest, Telstra, Verizon, expansions at Booz Allen Hamilton, Forever 21, National Instruments, NetApp, Pier 1 Imports, Public Broadcasting System (sic) [Public Broadcasting Service], TaylorMade Golf Company, Time Inc. I'm going to stop, but I wanted to give you a flavor for not just the number of customers but the quality of brands that are buying from us at the same time.\r\nKen, with that, let's take whatever questions anybody's got.\n\n---\n\nGreat. Thank you very much, Mark. Operator, if you could please instruct the audience for questions.",

If you don't hear me, I may have to reconnect so -- but I do have, obviously, Ken Bond on the call and Corey West, our Chief Accounting Officer, is also, I think, in the room with Larry and Mark.\r\nI'm going to focus today on our non-GAAP results for Q1. I'll then review guidance for Q2, and I will actually give some guidance for the entire fiscal year. And then I'll turn the call over to Mark and Larry for their comments.\r\nAs you know, we didn't provide you a stellar guidance for Q1, given the high volatility in exchange rates we were seeing at the time. As it happened, Q1 currency headwinds were actually 2% worse than we expected. The currency impact for both total revenue and hardware revenue ended up being 9%. And for software and cloud revenue, it was 8%.\r\nNow we do get benefit on the expense side, but because many of our expenses are in the United States, we get a very small benefit and, of course, our expenses are significantly lower than our revenues, and so our operating income was actually impacted by 12 points.\r\nEarnings per share was $0.06 lower because of currency, $0.01 worse than we anticipated. With currency still volatile, we will continue to use constant dollar growth rates on our quarterly calls so we can have some measure of consistency and also share with you how we look at the business.\r\nWe've also changed the presentation of our income statement to better reflect how we look at the company now that cloud has become a significant contributor to revenue. Our software business is really 2 parts of 1 business: the on-premise software business, which is steady and growing modestly; and the cloud business that is in a high-growth phase. We felt it made sense to show the components grouped together in our income statement to make it easier to see the progress we are making in the cloud.\r\nThe largest part is on-premise software revenue, which is made up of new software licenses plus software license updates and product support. On-premise software revenue was up 4% for the quarter to $5.8 billion. The largest component is software license updates and product support, which was up 8% for the quarter to $4.7 billion, with attach and renewal rates running at their usual high levels. We expect the on-premise software business to remain steady. Over the full year, I expect we will see modest growth comprised of continued growth in software support revenue that offsets any declines in new software license.\r\nMoving on to cloud. We start with SaaS and PaaS and then add Infrastructure as a Service to report total cloud revenues, which were up 34%. Within the cloud business, we continue to see excellent momentum in SaaS and PaaS, with bookings growth of 165% this quarter on top of the 54% growth from Q1 of last year.\r\nSaaS and PaaS revenue was $452 million, up 38% from last year. The triple-digit bookings growth that we have been experiencing will translate into significant acceleration in SaaS and PaaS revenue in the second half of the year. You can also see the coming revenue acceleration of our cloud business in the SaaS and PaaS billings and deferred revenue. SaaS and PaaS billings grew 70% in U.S. dollars this quarter on top of the 100% growth last quarter. Also, the gross deferred revenue balance is now nearly $1 billion and was up more than 100%. We've put the billings numbers up on the website for you to see in detail.\r\nOur significant success in cloud bookings will not only help accelerate our revenue growth, but it will also benefit our margins and earnings over time. Cloud revenue, as you know, is recognized ratably while new license is recognized all upfront. This timing difference has the effect of lowering near-term operating margins and earnings per share but, over time, will increase both.\r\nAs our SaaS and PaaS bookings have continued to accelerate, capital expenditures for the quarter were higher compared to last year. The bulk of them are largely complete, and you can see this in the $150 million sequential decline in CapEx this quarter. I expect CapEx for this year will be materially lower than last year as we utilize the investments that we have already made.\r\nWe are well aware of the near-term impact to gross margins that this build-out cost has had on the cloud business, and I think that Q4 of last year marks the bottom for SaaS and PaaS gross margins. Q1 cloud gross margins were up slightly on a sequential basis, and I think we'll see another modest improvement in Q2. But as our cloud business scales up, we expect SaaS and PaaS gross margins will be around 60% by Q4 and then 80% over the next 2 years.\r\nThe balance of our cloud revenue comes from cloud Infrastructure as a Service, which was up 23% to $160 million. The gross margin in this business was up sequentially to a record 45%. While SaaS and PaaS revenue will see much higher growth rates, along with significantly higher gross margins, we expect Infrastructure as a Service revenues will grow at a single-digit rate and maintain a steady margin profile over time.\r\nAs I mentioned, there are 2 parts to our software business that can be looked at separately but should really be considered together: the on-premise software business, which will grow modestly and serves as a tremendous base of loyal customers using our leading product; the SaaS and PaaS revenues will grow rapidly and will quickly become a significant contributor to revenues and profit as we help those same customers transform their businesses over time. In total, we will see growth in the total software business begin to increase this year as cloud revenue grows as a percentage of the total software business.\r\nFinally, total hardware revenues grew 6%, which included hardware products revenue of $570 million and hardware support revenue of $559 million. Total revenue for the quarter was up 7% from last year to $8.5 billion.\r\nNon-GAAP operating income was $3.5 billion and the operating margin was 41%. Sales and cloud investments, along with the integration of MICROS, each impacted operating margins negatively by about 1%. A non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter -- the non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 25%, which was 3.5 points higher than last year. The GAAP tax rate was 24.4%, which was 5 points higher than last year. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.53 in U.S. dollars, and GAAP EPS was $0.40 in U.S. dollars. As I said earlier, both were $0.06 lower due to currency. Free cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $11.8 billion.\r\nWe now have nearly $56 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is approximately $14 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $9.1 billion, up 10% in constant currency. This quarter, we repurchased more than 75 million shares for a total of $3 billion, up from our fiscal year '15 run rate of $2 billion a quarter. And given current market conditions, we expect to buy even more in Q2.\r\nThe Board of Directors also declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased more than 220 million shares for a total of $9.1 billion and paid out dividends of $2.4 billion for a total that is nearly 100% of free cash flow.\r\nNow to the guidance. As I mentioned, I'm going to give you guidance for Q2 and then for the whole year. We feel very good about the progress of our cloud transition, and clearly, customers are migrating to the Oracle cloud. Over time, we expect the cloud will result in more revenue and profit for Oracle as we take share from legacy, on-premise competitors, other cloud competitors who are limited to point solutions and the labor suppliers who can't possibly offer what we have already built.\r\nOf course, I am seeing many of the same financial news reports that all of you are about the whole world, and so I think it is still best to be prudent here. Additionally, we expect to see continued volatility in exchange rates and significant currency headwinds.\r\nI'm going to give you constant currency guidance, but if exchange rates remain the same as they are right now, we expect to see a currency headwind of about 6% on revenue and $0.05 on earnings per share. But again, it could be significantly worse. Maybe if we're lucky, it could be a little bit better. All of my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. So here goes.\r\nSaaS and PaaS revenue is expected to grow 36% to 40%. Cloud IaaS revenue is expected to grow 5% to 9%. Total cloud and on-premise software is expected to grow from 0 to 2%. Total revenue is expected to range from a negative 2 to a positive 1.\r\nNon-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be somewhere between $0.63 and $0.66. Now this assumes a non-GAAP tax rate of 25.5%. Of course, if this quarter is any example, it may end up being different. Looking further out, we expect to see a material acceleration in SaaS and PaaS revenue. As a result, I'm providing full fiscal year guidance for some key items. As before, my guidance on the full year is in constant currency.\r\nSaaS and PaaS revenue is expected to grow around 50%. On-premise software is expected to grow approximately 1%. Total cloud and on-premise software is expected to grow between 3% and 4%. Finally, SaaS and PaaS gross margins are expected to materially improve in the second half and exit the year at around 60%.\r\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Larry and Mark for their comments.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Lawrence Ellison (Executives)】\nThank you, Safra. This is Larry. Over the last 3 years, we've been in the start-up phase of our cloud business. We've developed services at all 4 layers of the cloud, a complete set of enterprise SaaS applications, plus our database and middleware platform services, plus compute and storage infrastructure services and an expanding set of data services.\r\nWe have deployed those cloud services in 19 data centers and 14 countries around the world. During this start-up phase of our cloud business, we have increased our data center service delivery capacity from 0.5 megawatt to 45 megawatts. That's a 90x, not 90%, a 90x increase in our data center capacity in 3 years. We've installed over 40,000 physical devices, 100,000 virtual machines and over 8 petabytes of storage.\r\nWe now have in place the physical infrastructure to dramatically expand our cloud customer base. We are entering the rapid growth, scale-out phase of our cloud business. We're adding thousands of new SaaS, PaaS, IaaS and data customers to our existing data centers. With all that customer growth on top of our existing infrastructure, we expect that our cloud margins will double from 40% to 80% over the next 2 years. Mark, it's your turn to tell everybody about all those great customer adds we had during Q1.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Mark Hurd (Executives)】\nThanks. By the process of elimination, this is Mark actually speaking. So I thought I'd do 2 things right to Larry's point, tell you about some wins but also give you some facts about the quarter.\r\nRevenue grew 38% year-on-year, 8% quarter-on-quarter. Billings grew 70%, again growing much faster than Salesforce and Workday. Bookings were USD 191 million, 165% growth. And like I always do, I want to tell you the number of customers we added. We added 612 new SaaS customers in the quarter, brand new logos. 616 expanded their SaaS business with us in the quarter.\r\nIn HCM, it was 166 new customers, more than double what Workday had. In CX, 280 customers. In ERP EPM, it was 200 customers, double last year. That is also more than Workday's lifetime sales. We now have 1,350 customers in our installed base. More than 300 are already live, including 100 that went live in just Q1.\r\nWhat's taken Workday 8 quarters to do, we did in 1 quarter. We never see SAP. PaaS, we added 800 new PaaS customers in the quarter. 2,500 in just 2 quarters. Bookings over $65 million. Now I think we have a shot in Q2 to book more PaaS than we actually did in Q4. I think we have a shot. That's how fast we see our pipeline growing in PaaS.\r\nI'm going to wrap up and then I'm going to read you some wins, but I just want to connect a few dots between what Safra and Larry described on the Oracle SaaS, PaaS cloud. We're currently at a $1.8 billion run rate in revenue. If you include IaaS, it's $2.4 billion, we will book between $1.5 billion and $2 billion in SaaS, PaaS ARRs in the fiscal year.\r\nGross deferred revenue has grown from $475 million to nearly $1 billion in the year. Billings are growing 70%. Gross margins are headed to 80%. SaaS, PaaS will be a very large and very profitable business for Oracle.\r\nNow in addition, I just want to give you some brands that we got in the quarter just so you have a feeling for who these -- all these people are that are buying solutions from us. So first, let me get HCM. A few wins. CMiC. They're an Australia Fusion HCM. We replaced Workday at CMiC in the quarter. Cypress Semiconductor, GDF SUEZ, Limited Brands, Nationwide Insurance, Restoration Hardware, Rutgers University. \r\nWe expanded our HCM Cloud at OMNICare, the Navy, Westpac Bank. In ERP EPM, AthenaHealth, Chicago Sun-Times. These are all new customers by the way. Fox Home Entertainment, U.S. Department of Energy, LendingClub Corp, Lenovo, LG Electronics, Rutgers University. By the way, you'll hear a few names twice, which is because they bought multiple pillars at the same time.\r\nIn sales service cloud, Fox Home Entertainment, Royal Mail, Sallie Mae, SIRIUS XM, Toshiba Medical, Wesfarmers, expansions at Cigna, Motorola, Nikon, Polycom, Virgin Atlantic, Westpac.\r\nIn our marketing cloud, Aer Lingus, General Mills, Jeanswest, Telstra, Verizon, expansions at Booz Allen Hamilton, Forever 21, National Instruments, NetApp, Pier 1 Imports, Public Broadcasting System (sic) [Public Broadcasting Service], TaylorMade Golf Company, Time Inc. I'm going to stop, but I wanted to give you a flavor for not just the number of customers but the quality of brands that are buying from us at the same time.\r\nKen, with that, let's take whatever questions anybody's got.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Ken Bond (Executives)】\nGreat. Thank you very much, Mark. Operator, if you could please instruct the audience for questions.",
      "transcript_text3": "Congrats on another great quarter and that call out with that 70% billings growth and also, thank you for the commentary on gross margin there going forward. Those are really helpful. I just wanted to double quick on the cloud for a little bit. SaaS and PaaS, Mark, you gave us some commentary on the PaaS side for Q2 and obviously, it sounds like that's ramping. But if you focus in on the SaaS side, what trends are you seeing there, HCM versus financials, maybe trends on adoption you can see there and go-lives? Any sort of color would be great.\n\n---\n\nWell, listen, I hate to compare our pillars because individually, they're all doing quite well. So I don't want to compare them against each other. But it's clear to me the ramp in ERP is extreme. I mean, when you look at the number of customers we've been able to bring on board -- remember, this is really our fifth quarter really in the business in the cloud. When you think of 1,350 customers that are now under contract, I think it's -- Larry can do this better than I can, but in roughly 23, 24 years, we're sort of already at, I don't know, 10% of the on-prem base is now in the cloud in terms of just sheer number of companies, and our pipeline is just full. So ERP, we're highly differentiated. We're way ahead of whoever it is you think is #2. And it's extreme. I think it's a combination, Phil, of what we've talked about before. It's -- our products have done nothing but get better and better and better. We're on now Release 10. Release 11 is now coming out. So our products have gotten better. Our people -- we've got more people that are better trained, and we just have now a lot of go-lives and a lot of references, and that's true across each one of our pillars, Phil.\n\n---\n\nI'd like to add a couple of things. One is the products that we have are being translated into more and more languages and updated for statutory compliance in more and more countries, so there are more markets we can sell them into. And we're adding supply chain and manufacturing with this release in ERP. So we have -- there's really nobody with a comprehensive suite of enterprise software products. And now -- and we're able to sell it internationally. So we think we have a huge advantage. I don't know who you consider a competitor in ERP. Again, every quarter -- I mean, if Workday is the competitor, every quarter, we sell -- Q1's our smallest quarter and we sold more deals in Q1 than Workday's sold ERP deals -- than Workday has sold since their company began. We do that every single quarter. So our relative strength -- I think as Mark said, I think all of our pillars are doing well. But on a relative basis, whoever is #2 in the ERP, they're a long, long way behind. And by the way, ERP is the largest segment of applications in the cloud. That will be just like people -- SAP was the leading on-premise application software vendor in the last generation of applications because they were #1 in ERP. The leading vendor -- applications vendor in the cloud this generation will also be whoever wins the ERP work.\n\n---\n\nPhil, we've fallen into the trap that I didn't want to fall into, it's comparing pillars. And you can tell how excited we are about ERP. But frankly, if you were in our marketing cloud business, you would be really excited. When you start running off the names that I've run off in marketing cloud, we are highly differentiated and we're winning. We've done well in B2C. We've done well in B2B. You add what's now occurred in service, I mean, we're starting to see again significant service growth in our service cloud. And our sales cloud, while, again, small and very different than ERP, up against the big competitor our service cloud is showing very strong growth. And so if you look in each of our pillars, we've added on some really cool stuff here just -- while I'm on a roll here, we've added on a very cool Data as a Service business. So our Data as a Service business, which come to us with our BlueKai acquisition and our Datalogix acquisition, is now another component of our marketing cloud. And that had tremendous performance in Q1. So Phil, it's really a story across sort of all of our pillars. ERP is, of course, exciting because to Larry's point, it's the biggest pillar in terms of total available market and one that has a lot of pull. It pulls a lot of HCM. When we win an ERP, our connect rate of HCM to ERP is pretty high and growing. But the success is broad-based, and that's sort of the enthusiasm you hear keep coming from us as we talk about what we see happening across our SaaS business.\n\n---\n\nI wanted to switch over from apps to database. I want to ask you broadly. I know the 12c is being adopted faster than 11. Can you give us an update on the adoption of multi-tenancy and in-memory options? And from a cloud perspective, how much traction are you getting with the SaaS providers and maybe we could add, say, for Database as a Service, how is that working as part of the broader Platform as a Service offering?\n\n---\n\nOkay. So we have never had and it's us -- any of our options for the database have an uptake as fast as we're seeing with multi-tenancy and in-memory. We never experienced people that wanted to get these 2 particular features turned on. And this is in our on-premise customer base. As you know, most major SaaS companies run Oracle. SAP runs Ariba on Oracle. SAP runs SuccessFactors on Oracle. SAP runs Concur on Oracle. NetSuite runs on Oracle. Salesforce runs on Oracle. And all of them are able to deliver more efficiency in terms of [indiscernible] by turning on the in-memory feature. All of them are able to -- by [indiscernible] means they use less hardware and they deliver better performance. So they lower their rental cost and deliver a better performance. All of them are much more efficient in the usage of hardware resource by turning on multi-tenancy. Now these guys have multi-tenancy built into their applications. That doesn't mean they don't layer things. So they have multi-tenancy at the application level, multi-tenancy at the database level and then multi-tenancy at the operating system level, which is called VM. All of those things kind of conspire together to more efficiently use -- utilize your hardware, provide better recovery, security piece, security systems. So we see the demand from our traditional on-prem customer and the new generation of cloud customers for these 2 new options unlike anything that's out before.\n\n---\n\nJust to finishup, I was curious as to 2 things. One is how is Database as a Service fitting with your broader Platform as a Service offering? And is there any slowing of database in expectation of release too for 12c?\n\n---\n\nMichael, I don't think -- as you know, if you buy the database now and you get all -- and you maintain support, you get all the subsequent versions. So no, I don't think there's any slowing. However, we are encouraging people to run all their dev tests, all their development tests in our cloud as opposed to on-prem, which does imply a shift from a database on-prem to our database service. That's what we want them to do. We think that lowers their cost and raises our revenue and profits. We think it works very well for us. So you really have to look at those 2 businesses added together. And I think that's what Safra's saying in her presentation. You can't look at database on-premise separately from PaaS, or Database as a Service. It's really the sum of those that have to grow. The sum of those have to grow at the top line level and that sum of those have to grow in terms of profitability. And we see the sum -- and we see that happening right now. So we think PaaS, yes, some people will elect to buy Database as a Service as opposed to running dev tests on-prem. But we think that's a good thing. We think we -- they get a more efficient service. They spend less. We get more.\n\n---\n\nI think one thing Michael that I'd add to it is from a customer's point of view, these decisions aren't necessarily binary. Meaning, that I'm going to run Database as a Service as opposed to database on-prem. The major differentiation for Oracle that nobody else can do is we can actually do this on-premise for you and do it for you in the cloud. And we can do it at the exact same time. We can deliver to you a capability in the cloud and we can deliver the exact same capability to you on-premise and move those workloads back and forth, whether that's Database as a Service, some dev tests, dev testing our cloud into your data center to run your production applications. It's important to understand, this is a huge differentiator that only this company can deliver. We're not just cloud. We have a fantastic hypergrowth cloud with a on-prem capability that nobody else brings the 2 together like Oracle.\n\n---\n\nFor example, we have Exadata as a service that we're rolling out at Oracle OpenWorld. So we have Exadata as a service in our cloud. And we obviously sell Exadata machines to run on-prem. It's the most modern way, most efficient, cost-effective way to run our database. So you can run part of your database workload on-prem on that Exadata platform. Part of that database workload in our cloud on that Exadata platform and our management tools. When you're running your data center assets in our cloud assets, the person who's running that thinks that, that's 1 pool of assets with 1 set of management tools that allow you to run your Exadatas and the Exadatas in the cloud together, move data back and forth, move workloads back and forth. There's -- this coexistence of cloud and on-premise computing is going to be a decade-long process, if not forever. But during this long period of coexistence, we think it's very important to have absolute compatibility between on-prem and in the cloud. And Mark makes -- Mark points out our biggest differentiator in this business. We have great on-premise technology with some of our fancy appliances like Exadata, Big Data Appliance, Exalogic, I can go on and on. And we offer those -- that same exact DaaS technology in the cloud and we lace it together and make it look like one set of assets.\n\n---\n\nAt the risk of over-answering your question, I'm going to stop here. By the time we get to Open World and Larry presents on Sunday night, we will have now fundamentally all of our software assets redone for the modern cloud. So the ability to do what Larry said is not something that's 5 years away, 4 years away, 3 years away. We can start delivering Exadata as a service in these opportunities that Larry described now.\n\n---\n\nThis is a question for Mark. I was just wondering if you could share with us, if you were to characterize what inning we're in of the SaaS transition, if you could kind of help us think about that. And also when do you think we start to see -- I know you mentioned some commentary about momentum in PaaS, but when do we see that become a material part of that SaaS, PaaS revenue line? And then I guess, the follow-up to that would just be, you touched, I think, on Phil's question about the SaaS competitive dynamics. But can you walk us through how you're thinking about the competitive environment far PaaS as well?\n\n---\n\nOkay. So that was one of those, let me give you a question, 6 parts type thing. Heather, I'll try. So in the baseball analogy, I don't know, top of the first. We're in the very beginning stages. It depends a little which pillar we're talking about.\n\n---\n\nWell, for SaaS first and then for PaaS.\n\n---\n\nStart with SaaS, and I am talking about SaaS, and I'm talking across each pillar. I mean, the ERP opportunity has just started. Now it happens that we're ramping incredibly fast. I think if I had said 5 quarters ago and sat -- and said, \"Hey, I think we'll have 1,350 customers signed up to run in our cloud in about 4 or 5 quarters\" -- you should go seek some help because it won't happen that fast. It has. That said, we are only now getting to the point, Heather, where we actually have all the references required. We've got our sales force scaled. I think we are in -- and by the way, to Larry's point, I thought Larry made a great point. We are releasing a lot of new products. It may not -- it may not come across that way, but with the next release, we now release products that are localized for many, many more countries. Markets that frankly we just weren't in given 6 months ago, in addition to the fact that in ERP, we're releasing supply chain manufacturing now so we can now go after manufacturers as well. I've made a comment about what we've added now in marketing in terms of our data cloud, that we now supplemented our marketing cloud with. We have new releases coming in service cloud. So there's just a whole suite of products. I would tell you top of the first, this is a multiyear long, long game. We just happen to be extremely well positioned as the only one who has a suite of products and the only one that has best-of-breed products that are in a suite, that can then combine it, to your point, with a PaaS capability that allows you to extend those applications without destroying the upgradeability of the application suite that you bought. So it's a great match -- our pipeline. A year ago at SAM, I made a statement about the size of our pipeline. And probably nobody remembers it because it seems like a long time ago. Think about since then, our pipeline in SaaS, this is our annualized pipeline, has more than doubled, more than doubled off of a really big number. So now you've got a pipeline scale. And the great thing is I know nobody thought at that time, you've seen it now come through the pipeline and turn into bookings. And my expectations are very favorable as I've indicated about what SaaS bookings are going to look like for the rest of the year.\n\n---\n\nSafra, I'd like to drill into your comments on cloud gross margins and the expansion that you're expecting as we exit this year and look further out. Pretty significant. And I guess the question is, is that really just driven by revenue scale? And is there a certain level of revenue scale in PaaS and SaaS that you need to achieve the target 80% in 2 years?\n\n---\n\nOkay. Well, it's actually going to hit, in many ways, on -- in both revenue and expenses because we have -- as Larry explained, we have invested immense resources in building up our infrastructure. And as I mentioned on the call, our capital expenditure numbers have been very, very large as compared to what we are used to historically. And so we've put out those expenditures and we've started to amortize them. However, in the second half of this year, our capital expenditure numbers are going to be significantly lower, even significantly lower than even this quarter. You'll see, I believe, at least another $100 million decline and then a continuing reduction. And the reason that matters is because what you'll simultaneously be seeing is a massive amount of revenue which can finally be recognized. That is going to start, in true earnest, in the second half of the year, in Q3 and Q4, while simultaneously, we will not be adding capacity. In fact, we'll be spending less than we historically have spent on capital expenditures. We'll be back to numbers that you would have looked at and seen in fiscal year '14. So as expenses -- and in addition, you understand, it's not only capital expenditures. It's all sorts of staffing and labor and tools, et cetera, that have all been put in place. And we will not have to add them while the revenue is going to start flowing both out of the balance sheet, which is extremely apparent, and you will be able to look at it in detail in the Q filing that we should do either at the end of this week or at the beginning of next, and in our new sales. So that's what it is. Revenue up, expenses stabilizing and actually going down.\n\n---\n\nMy question is for Safra. Safra, how do you view the investment trade-off between the license business and the cloud business because I think it's pretty apparent to us that one business has higher growth but lower margin? And when I parse your comments, it looks like CapEx is going to come down for the cloud business. So are we at a point where the license business has troughed and is not going to decline anymore and that the profit growth of the cloud business will start to add on? And that this year, it sounds like it's the trough in your operating profits. A lot of the other software companies have been attempting to make this model transition, been resetting their numbers for the license piece by their own volition is coming down troughing and then the cloud business starts to pick up. So where is -- how should we look at Oracle in the context of the shift that's happening here?\n\n---\n\nSure. Well, first of all, the way we look at the on-premise business, and I'm not sure I'm entirely understanding your question, but there's the new licenses, and of course, our massive installed base of license subscriptions. We look at that as the on-premise business. And that business is steady, growing slightly, very profitable, of course, because we are at scale. We still make a lot of investments in that area. However, you should be thinking about the cloud business as another way for us to offer that same software to our customers in a different way, where we are actually hosting the software and doing a lot more of the labor. And because we'll have economies of scale, they could not possibly have as individual customers so really it's all one business. However, more and more, when we provide it as a cloud provider, we are providing the hardware, the software, the labor, all in a package. And that gives us a significantly larger amount of their wallet share. Simultaneously, the customer is actually spending less overall because we can supply this package in a very economical way. But also since all of it is our own differentiated intellectual property, we can do it at much higher margins. And the more scale we get, the more profitable we will be. We have been in a startup mode in this whole area. We've done it basically within our profit envelope. However, this extremely quick transition, which you are truly seeing the pivot in this fiscal year, which is the reason we're breaking it out for you and really breaking our own rules of guidance where we're actually giving you a full year guidance so you can see how we're coming out of it.\n\n---\n\nSo Safra, I want to conclude this and take the financial implication, could this year be the trough in operating profits? And then as a result of the nice investments, we start to see the operating income of the company start to grow the next fiscal year?\n\n---\n\nI believe it is. Yes, absolutely.\n\n---\n\nFor Mark and Safra, I think your investors understand this transition to cloud is going to take time. But the ramp is definitely taking longer than some of the financial forecasts you've given the last several quarters. And now you're calling for a weaker first half but a better second half. I guess just what's underpinning your confidence that this ramp is going to happen in the back half?\n\n---\n\nFrankly, I can -- it's not possible that it does not happen. These are -- there is a lot of revenue on the balance sheet that will be recognized in the second half. It cannot not be. It is appropriate to do that, to the extent that in some cases, customers have been through their promotion period and also, we just have booked so many contracts that are ramping up and billing and starting to bill. There really is -- it's not avoidable. It is inevitable that Q2 is -- that half 2 -- second half is going to be very significant.\n\n---\n\nBrent, I just add to it. First, we have contracts. Second, when you look at the balance sheet, you see the $1 billion of deferred, you can just do the math. So we have the contracts and so it's just not, to Safra's point, it's not a guessing game.\n\n---\n\nOkay, that's very helpful. Just a follow-up on the license guide, Safra, for the full year. You mentioned that, that will stabilize versus what you saw last year in terms of the decline. What's giving you the confidence there that, that will stabilize versus what you saw last year?\n\n---\n\nWell, I have my forecast. I have my closure rates that I'm expecting. Remember, it's not new license only. It is a software. It is our software installed base with extremely high renewal rates that continues. When we sell new licenses in addition to our base, then we get additional growth. Again, it's -- the only question is what level of decline we have in new license. We're being conservative. There's always risk that it won't be. But again, new license gotten to be a smaller percentage of that whole on-premise business. And we're doing the same type of estimating that we do, do our best with all the data we have.\n\n---\n\nSafra, I wanted to stay on that point a little bit. So if you look at the license number that we see at the moment, it was like last quarter was minus 10, this quarter was minus 9. And obviously, with the cloud transition going on, which impacts you negatively, can you talk a little bit about other factors that might impact this? And we all heard about the issues around China, et cetera. So maybe talk a little bit about what you see in the different regions that might impact that growth number as well.\n\n---\n\nSure. I mean, look, there is no question that internationally, there is quite a lot of chaos, to say the least. And the currency impact of countries that we have been doing very well is not helping. Even though my Latin America team is executing out of the park in constant currency, the devaluation of the different currencies in LAD, for example, are very negatively affecting my U.S. dollar results. Obviously, there is quite a lot going on in Europe in different parts. And both that and currency. I feel that Asia Pacific for us is actually stabilizing. China is not a big country for us historically, so that's less of an issue for us directly. But the countries and businesses that are impacted by the China trade, like Australia, Canada, Brazil, those can be at risk. So I'm not an economist. I -- these things are impacted by, especially transactional business like new hardware sales or new license sales are impacted by these regional issues. But in general, on-premise software, which is dominated by software updates and product support, customers renew because that is software that is very important to them and is doing the most important work in their companies, governments or nonprofits. And so that is obviously very, very steady for us and continues to do well. But the transactional business is at the same potential risk. However, the cloud momentum is so strong that overall, we expect very significant growth, and that is from contracts already in hand in most cases.\n\n---\n\nSafra, I'd like to better understand something I thought I understood, but -- it's how exactly your bookings for SaaS and PaaS convert to revenue. For instance, bookings -- PaaS and SaaS bookings last quarter were somewhere around $425 million. And if you assume this was signed towards the end of the quarter, I'd expect cloud revenue SaaS and PaaS to grow sequentially by about 1/4 of this number or by about $100 million. But it only grew by a little more than $30 million. And I'm just curious, is PaaS -- because it sounded like PaaS was like -- had a real big quarter last quarter. Is the revenue recognition like SaaS, which recognized immediately in the same amount over like 3 years of the contract? Or is it recognized a little differently, where it's recognized as the customer consumes the technology? What am I missing here?\n\n---\n\nYou're actually not missing anything. You're exactly asking the right question. And unfortunately, the answer is it depends because depending on what kind of agreement the customer signed, they may have signed a metered agreement, which means it'll be recognized as they use it. However, it will expire after a certain time period if they don't use it. When -- and that is what we call metered. On the other hand, to the extent that they have a subscription, then let's say, 1 month's worth is recognized and then another month whether they use it or not. So SaaS is almost always a subscription. PaaS can be either metered or a subscription. And so it is recognized differently. And that's it.\n\n---\n\nThat actually makes a ton of sense. It's really helpful. But just one quick question follow-up to that. If once -- if it's a metered PaaS deal and it expired -- expires, at that time, given the contract terms, the customers, does that -- do you recognize anything remaining on that contract at the time of expiration?\n\n---\n\nIf it's expired, let's say, they bought $100,000 metered, you could almost consider it a gift card. If they use it all on the first day, I book it all right then. If they don't use it at all, I book it when it expires.\n\n---\n\nJohn, I'll just add, on SaaS, just to make sure you understand what's happening as we get to Q3 because Safra talked about Q3 and Q4. So when we entered the SaaS market, we had a series of promotions, meaning that you would get some time to install. We had -- our strategy was to give you an incentive when you bought, that you had time to then implement and that promotion had a certain amount of time associated with it. Obviously, that was part of building up our reference base. Secondly, as we built up our reference base, we actually shortened the promotions. So that actually -- it actually went down by half the period of time. The 2 sets of promotions over the last couple of years, just by coincidence, coterminously end at the end of Q2. So the percent of the bookings that were on those types of promotions both end at the end of Q2 of this fiscal year. So that's why one of the reasons in SaaS, why you will see a jump in revenue that also will not be explained by bookings. So again, while you said I couldn't explain Q2 to bookings, you won't be able to explain exactly the alignment of the increase in revenue based on the bookings either because underneath it is this promotion. So there are multiple dimensions here. There's this promotion dimension. There's the dimension that Safra described, which is about a percent of our PaaS is metered and a percent of our PaaS is subscription. So there's a couple of different ways you can consume the PaaS. In addition to it, it takes a certain amount of time for us, in some cases -- I told you about a win, for example, last quarter at HSBC, a very large ERP in the cloud win. It will take us several months to fully provision that ERP for HSBC. So it's those factors together that formulate the conversion of the bookings to revenue.\n\n---\n\nBut just to be clear...\n\n---\n\nI'll repeat one more time why we are so confident. We have the contracts, we know the expiration of the promotions. We know exactly when the PaaS expires, and in addition, you see all of that as it relates to deferred on the balance sheet.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And just to be clear, Mark, once you start -- you're really giving, in the SaaS examples you gave, it's still once it starts to be -- you may delay the beginning, when you should begin to start recognizing the revenue, but it will be recognized as a subscription so evenly through the term.\n\n---\n\nYes, it is. It's a very important tool, John, because instead of discounting, you actually renew against a higher rate, and the promotion is basically a window by which you have time to get installed. And it's a very important tool as you're building up a reference base. And that's what we've done. Now the promotions over that period of time, call that a 2- or 3-year period of time, have declined and declined and declined. So the amount of promotion that's available on our SaaS portfolio is materially smaller than it was 2 years ago and materially smaller than it was a year ago. And so what happens is these things -- the confluence of events really come together in Q3, which is where you see this pop in our revenue. And then from there, you'll begin to see a more ratable alignment of bookings to revenue, sort of save the one point about the PaaS consumption that Safra was making.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Mark. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours. Dial-in information can be found in the press release issued earlier today. Please call the Investor Relations department with follow-up questions from this call. We look forward to speaking with you. Thank you for joining us today, and with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for closing.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Philip Winslow (Analysts)】\nCongrats on another great quarter and that call out with that 70% billings growth and also, thank you for the commentary on gross margin there going forward. Those are really helpful. I just wanted to double quick on the cloud for a little bit. SaaS and PaaS, Mark, you gave us some commentary on the PaaS side for Q2 and obviously, it sounds like that's ramping. But if you focus in on the SaaS side, what trends are you seeing there, HCM versus financials, maybe trends on adoption you can see there and go-lives? Any sort of color would be great.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Hurd (Executives)】\nWell, listen, I hate to compare our pillars because individually, they're all doing quite well. So I don't want to compare them against each other. But it's clear to me the ramp in ERP is extreme. I mean, when you look at the number of customers we've been able to bring on board -- remember, this is really our fifth quarter really in the business in the cloud. When you think of 1,350 customers that are now under contract, I think it's -- Larry can do this better than I can, but in roughly 23, 24 years, we're sort of already at, I don't know, 10% of the on-prem base is now in the cloud in terms of just sheer number of companies, and our pipeline is just full. So ERP, we're highly differentiated. We're way ahead of whoever it is you think is #2. And it's extreme. I think it's a combination, Phil, of what we've talked about before. It's -- our products have done nothing but get better and better and better. We're on now Release 10. Release 11 is now coming out. So our products have gotten better. Our people -- we've got more people that are better trained, and we just have now a lot of go-lives and a lot of references, and that's true across each one of our pillars, Phil.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Ellison (Executives)】\nI'd like to add a couple of things. One is the products that we have are being translated into more and more languages and updated for statutory compliance in more and more countries, so there are more markets we can sell them into. And we're adding supply chain and manufacturing with this release in ERP. So we have -- there's really nobody with a comprehensive suite of enterprise software products. And now -- and we're able to sell it internationally. So we think we have a huge advantage. I don't know who you consider a competitor in ERP. Again, every quarter -- I mean, if Workday is the competitor, every quarter, we sell -- Q1's our smallest quarter and we sold more deals in Q1 than Workday's sold ERP deals -- than Workday has sold since their company began. We do that every single quarter. So our relative strength -- I think as Mark said, I think all of our pillars are doing well. But on a relative basis, whoever is #2 in the ERP, they're a long, long way behind. And by the way, ERP is the largest segment of applications in the cloud. That will be just like people -- SAP was the leading on-premise application software vendor in the last generation of applications because they were #1 in ERP. The leading vendor -- applications vendor in the cloud this generation will also be whoever wins the ERP work.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Hurd (Executives)】\nPhil, we've fallen into the trap that I didn't want to fall into, it's comparing pillars. And you can tell how excited we are about ERP. But frankly, if you were in our marketing cloud business, you would be really excited. When you start running off the names that I've run off in marketing cloud, we are highly differentiated and we're winning. We've done well in B2C. We've done well in B2B. You add what's now occurred in service, I mean, we're starting to see again significant service growth in our service cloud. And our sales cloud, while, again, small and very different than ERP, up against the big competitor our service cloud is showing very strong growth. And so if you look in each of our pillars, we've added on some really cool stuff here just -- while I'm on a roll here, we've added on a very cool Data as a Service business. So our Data as a Service business, which come to us with our BlueKai acquisition and our Datalogix acquisition, is now another component of our marketing cloud. And that had tremendous performance in Q1. So Phil, it's really a story across sort of all of our pillars. ERP is, of course, exciting because to Larry's point, it's the biggest pillar in terms of total available market and one that has a lot of pull. It pulls a lot of HCM. When we win an ERP, our connect rate of HCM to ERP is pretty high and growing. But the success is broad-based, and that's sort of the enthusiasm you hear keep coming from us as we talk about what we see happening across our SaaS business.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Turits (Analysts)】\nI wanted to switch over from apps to database. I want to ask you broadly. I know the 12c is being adopted faster than 11. Can you give us an update on the adoption of multi-tenancy and in-memory options? And from a cloud perspective, how much traction are you getting with the SaaS providers and maybe we could add, say, for Database as a Service, how is that working as part of the broader Platform as a Service offering?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Ellison (Executives)】\nOkay. So we have never had and it's us -- any of our options for the database have an uptake as fast as we're seeing with multi-tenancy and in-memory. We never experienced people that wanted to get these 2 particular features turned on. And this is in our on-premise customer base. As you know, most major SaaS companies run Oracle. SAP runs Ariba on Oracle. SAP runs SuccessFactors on Oracle. SAP runs Concur on Oracle. NetSuite runs on Oracle. Salesforce runs on Oracle. And all of them are able to deliver more efficiency in terms of [indiscernible] by turning on the in-memory feature. All of them are able to -- by [indiscernible] means they use less hardware and they deliver better performance. So they lower their rental cost and deliver a better performance. All of them are much more efficient in the usage of hardware resource by turning on multi-tenancy. Now these guys have multi-tenancy built into their applications. That doesn't mean they don't layer things. So they have multi-tenancy at the application level, multi-tenancy at the database level and then multi-tenancy at the operating system level, which is called VM. All of those things kind of conspire together to more efficiently use -- utilize your hardware, provide better recovery, security piece, security systems. So we see the demand from our traditional on-prem customer and the new generation of cloud customers for these 2 new options unlike anything that's out before.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Turits (Analysts)】\nJust to finishup, I was curious as to 2 things. One is how is Database as a Service fitting with your broader Platform as a Service offering? And is there any slowing of database in expectation of release too for 12c?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Ellison (Executives)】\nMichael, I don't think -- as you know, if you buy the database now and you get all -- and you maintain support, you get all the subsequent versions. So no, I don't think there's any slowing. However, we are encouraging people to run all their dev tests, all their development tests in our cloud as opposed to on-prem, which does imply a shift from a database on-prem to our database service. That's what we want them to do. We think that lowers their cost and raises our revenue and profits. We think it works very well for us. So you really have to look at those 2 businesses added together. And I think that's what Safra's saying in her presentation. You can't look at database on-premise separately from PaaS, or Database as a Service. It's really the sum of those that have to grow. The sum of those have to grow at the top line level and that sum of those have to grow in terms of profitability. And we see the sum -- and we see that happening right now. So we think PaaS, yes, some people will elect to buy Database as a Service as opposed to running dev tests on-prem. But we think that's a good thing. We think we -- they get a more efficient service. They spend less. We get more.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Hurd (Executives)】\nI think one thing Michael that I'd add to it is from a customer's point of view, these decisions aren't necessarily binary. Meaning, that I'm going to run Database as a Service as opposed to database on-prem. The major differentiation for Oracle that nobody else can do is we can actually do this on-premise for you and do it for you in the cloud. And we can do it at the exact same time. We can deliver to you a capability in the cloud and we can deliver the exact same capability to you on-premise and move those workloads back and forth, whether that's Database as a Service, some dev tests, dev testing our cloud into your data center to run your production applications. It's important to understand, this is a huge differentiator that only this company can deliver. We're not just cloud. We have a fantastic hypergrowth cloud with a on-prem capability that nobody else brings the 2 together like Oracle.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Ellison (Executives)】\nFor example, we have Exadata as a service that we're rolling out at Oracle OpenWorld. So we have Exadata as a service in our cloud. And we obviously sell Exadata machines to run on-prem. It's the most modern way, most efficient, cost-effective way to run our database. So you can run part of your database workload on-prem on that Exadata platform. Part of that database workload in our cloud on that Exadata platform and our management tools. When you're running your data center assets in our cloud assets, the person who's running that thinks that, that's 1 pool of assets with 1 set of management tools that allow you to run your Exadatas and the Exadatas in the cloud together, move data back and forth, move workloads back and forth. There's -- this coexistence of cloud and on-premise computing is going to be a decade-long process, if not forever. But during this long period of coexistence, we think it's very important to have absolute compatibility between on-prem and in the cloud. And Mark makes -- Mark points out our biggest differentiator in this business. We have great on-premise technology with some of our fancy appliances like Exadata, Big Data Appliance, Exalogic, I can go on and on. And we offer those -- that same exact DaaS technology in the cloud and we lace it together and make it look like one set of assets.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Hurd (Executives)】\nAt the risk of over-answering your question, I'm going to stop here. By the time we get to Open World and Larry presents on Sunday night, we will have now fundamentally all of our software assets redone for the modern cloud. So the ability to do what Larry said is not something that's 5 years away, 4 years away, 3 years away. We can start delivering Exadata as a service in these opportunities that Larry described now.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Heather Bellini (Analysts)】\nThis is a question for Mark. I was just wondering if you could share with us, if you were to characterize what inning we're in of the SaaS transition, if you could kind of help us think about that. And also when do you think we start to see -- I know you mentioned some commentary about momentum in PaaS, but when do we see that become a material part of that SaaS, PaaS revenue line? And then I guess, the follow-up to that would just be, you touched, I think, on Phil's question about the SaaS competitive dynamics. But can you walk us through how you're thinking about the competitive environment far PaaS as well?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Hurd (Executives)】\nOkay. So that was one of those, let me give you a question, 6 parts type thing. Heather, I'll try. So in the baseball analogy, I don't know, top of the first. We're in the very beginning stages. It depends a little which pillar we're talking about.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Heather Bellini (Analysts)】\nWell, for SaaS first and then for PaaS.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Hurd (Executives)】\nStart with SaaS, and I am talking about SaaS, and I'm talking across each pillar. I mean, the ERP opportunity has just started. Now it happens that we're ramping incredibly fast. I think if I had said 5 quarters ago and sat -- and said, \"Hey, I think we'll have 1,350 customers signed up to run in our cloud in about 4 or 5 quarters\" -- you should go seek some help because it won't happen that fast. It has. That said, we are only now getting to the point, Heather, where we actually have all the references required. We've got our sales force scaled. I think we are in -- and by the way, to Larry's point, I thought Larry made a great point. We are releasing a lot of new products. It may not -- it may not come across that way, but with the next release, we now release products that are localized for many, many more countries. Markets that frankly we just weren't in given 6 months ago, in addition to the fact that in ERP, we're releasing supply chain manufacturing now so we can now go after manufacturers as well. I've made a comment about what we've added now in marketing in terms of our data cloud, that we now supplemented our marketing cloud with. We have new releases coming in service cloud. So there's just a whole suite of products. I would tell you top of the first, this is a multiyear long, long game. We just happen to be extremely well positioned as the only one who has a suite of products and the only one that has best-of-breed products that are in a suite, that can then combine it, to your point, with a PaaS capability that allows you to extend those applications without destroying the upgradeability of the application suite that you bought. So it's a great match -- our pipeline. A year ago at SAM, I made a statement about the size of our pipeline. And probably nobody remembers it because it seems like a long time ago. Think about since then, our pipeline in SaaS, this is our annualized pipeline, has more than doubled, more than doubled off of a really big number. So now you've got a pipeline scale. And the great thing is I know nobody thought at that time, you've seen it now come through the pipeline and turn into bookings. And my expectations are very favorable as I've indicated about what SaaS bookings are going to look like for the rest of the year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ross MacMillan (Analysts)】\nSafra, I'd like to drill into your comments on cloud gross margins and the expansion that you're expecting as we exit this year and look further out. Pretty significant. And I guess the question is, is that really just driven by revenue scale? And is there a certain level of revenue scale in PaaS and SaaS that you need to achieve the target 80% in 2 years?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Safra Catz (Executives)】\nOkay. Well, it's actually going to hit, in many ways, on -- in both revenue and expenses because we have -- as Larry explained, we have invested immense resources in building up our infrastructure. And as I mentioned on the call, our capital expenditure numbers have been very, very large as compared to what we are used to historically. And so we've put out those expenditures and we've started to amortize them. However, in the second half of this year, our capital expenditure numbers are going to be significantly lower, even significantly lower than even this quarter. You'll see, I believe, at least another $100 million decline and then a continuing reduction. And the reason that matters is because what you'll simultaneously be seeing is a massive amount of revenue which can finally be recognized. That is going to start, in true earnest, in the second half of the year, in Q3 and Q4, while simultaneously, we will not be adding capacity. In fact, we'll be spending less than we historically have spent on capital expenditures. We'll be back to numbers that you would have looked at and seen in fiscal year '14. So as expenses -- and in addition, you understand, it's not only capital expenditures. It's all sorts of staffing and labor and tools, et cetera, that have all been put in place. And we will not have to add them while the revenue is going to start flowing both out of the balance sheet, which is extremely apparent, and you will be able to look at it in detail in the Q filing that we should do either at the end of this week or at the beginning of next, and in our new sales. So that's what it is. Revenue up, expenses stabilizing and actually going down.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kash Rangan (Analysts)】\nMy question is for Safra. Safra, how do you view the investment trade-off between the license business and the cloud business because I think it's pretty apparent to us that one business has higher growth but lower margin? And when I parse your comments, it looks like CapEx is going to come down for the cloud business. So are we at a point where the license business has troughed and is not going to decline anymore and that the profit growth of the cloud business will start to add on? And that this year, it sounds like it's the trough in your operating profits. A lot of the other software companies have been attempting to make this model transition, been resetting their numbers for the license piece by their own volition is coming down troughing and then the cloud business starts to pick up. So where is -- how should we look at Oracle in the context of the shift that's happening here?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Safra Catz (Executives)】\nSure. Well, first of all, the way we look at the on-premise business, and I'm not sure I'm entirely understanding your question, but there's the new licenses, and of course, our massive installed base of license subscriptions. We look at that as the on-premise business. And that business is steady, growing slightly, very profitable, of course, because we are at scale. We still make a lot of investments in that area. However, you should be thinking about the cloud business as another way for us to offer that same software to our customers in a different way, where we are actually hosting the software and doing a lot more of the labor. And because we'll have economies of scale, they could not possibly have as individual customers so really it's all one business. However, more and more, when we provide it as a cloud provider, we are providing the hardware, the software, the labor, all in a package. And that gives us a significantly larger amount of their wallet share. Simultaneously, the customer is actually spending less overall because we can supply this package in a very economical way. But also since all of it is our own differentiated intellectual property, we can do it at much higher margins. And the more scale we get, the more profitable we will be. We have been in a startup mode in this whole area. We've done it basically within our profit envelope. However, this extremely quick transition, which you are truly seeing the pivot in this fiscal year, which is the reason we're breaking it out for you and really breaking our own rules of guidance where we're actually giving you a full year guidance so you can see how we're coming out of it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kash Rangan (Analysts)】\nSo Safra, I want to conclude this and take the financial implication, could this year be the trough in operating profits? And then as a result of the nice investments, we start to see the operating income of the company start to grow the next fiscal year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Safra Catz (Executives)】\nI believe it is. Yes, absolutely.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Brent Thill (Analysts)】\nFor Mark and Safra, I think your investors understand this transition to cloud is going to take time. But the ramp is definitely taking longer than some of the financial forecasts you've given the last several quarters. And now you're calling for a weaker first half but a better second half. I guess just what's underpinning your confidence that this ramp is going to happen in the back half?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Safra Catz (Executives)】\nFrankly, I can -- it's not possible that it does not happen. These are -- there is a lot of revenue on the balance sheet that will be recognized in the second half. It cannot not be. It is appropriate to do that, to the extent that in some cases, customers have been through their promotion period and also, we just have booked so many contracts that are ramping up and billing and starting to bill. There really is -- it's not avoidable. It is inevitable that Q2 is -- that half 2 -- second half is going to be very significant.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Hurd (Executives)】\nBrent, I just add to it. First, we have contracts. Second, when you look at the balance sheet, you see the $1 billion of deferred, you can just do the math. So we have the contracts and so it's just not, to Safra's point, it's not a guessing game.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Brent Thill (Analysts)】\nOkay, that's very helpful. Just a follow-up on the license guide, Safra, for the full year. You mentioned that, that will stabilize versus what you saw last year in terms of the decline. What's giving you the confidence there that, that will stabilize versus what you saw last year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Safra Catz (Executives)】\nWell, I have my forecast. I have my closure rates that I'm expecting. Remember, it's not new license only. It is a software. It is our software installed base with extremely high renewal rates that continues. When we sell new licenses in addition to our base, then we get additional growth. Again, it's -- the only question is what level of decline we have in new license. We're being conservative. There's always risk that it won't be. But again, new license gotten to be a smaller percentage of that whole on-premise business. And we're doing the same type of estimating that we do, do our best with all the data we have.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Raimo Lenschow (Analysts)】\nSafra, I wanted to stay on that point a little bit. So if you look at the license number that we see at the moment, it was like last quarter was minus 10, this quarter was minus 9. And obviously, with the cloud transition going on, which impacts you negatively, can you talk a little bit about other factors that might impact this? And we all heard about the issues around China, et cetera. So maybe talk a little bit about what you see in the different regions that might impact that growth number as well.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Safra Catz (Executives)】\nSure. I mean, look, there is no question that internationally, there is quite a lot of chaos, to say the least. And the currency impact of countries that we have been doing very well is not helping. Even though my Latin America team is executing out of the park in constant currency, the devaluation of the different currencies in LAD, for example, are very negatively affecting my U.S. dollar results. Obviously, there is quite a lot going on in Europe in different parts. And both that and currency. I feel that Asia Pacific for us is actually stabilizing. China is not a big country for us historically, so that's less of an issue for us directly. But the countries and businesses that are impacted by the China trade, like Australia, Canada, Brazil, those can be at risk. So I'm not an economist. I -- these things are impacted by, especially transactional business like new hardware sales or new license sales are impacted by these regional issues. But in general, on-premise software, which is dominated by software updates and product support, customers renew because that is software that is very important to them and is doing the most important work in their companies, governments or nonprofits. And so that is obviously very, very steady for us and continues to do well. But the transactional business is at the same potential risk. However, the cloud momentum is so strong that overall, we expect very significant growth, and that is from contracts already in hand in most cases.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John DiFucci (Analysts)】\nSafra, I'd like to better understand something I thought I understood, but -- it's how exactly your bookings for SaaS and PaaS convert to revenue. For instance, bookings -- PaaS and SaaS bookings last quarter were somewhere around $425 million. And if you assume this was signed towards the end of the quarter, I'd expect cloud revenue SaaS and PaaS to grow sequentially by about 1/4 of this number or by about $100 million. But it only grew by a little more than $30 million. And I'm just curious, is PaaS -- because it sounded like PaaS was like -- had a real big quarter last quarter. Is the revenue recognition like SaaS, which recognized immediately in the same amount over like 3 years of the contract? Or is it recognized a little differently, where it's recognized as the customer consumes the technology? What am I missing here?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Safra Catz (Executives)】\nYou're actually not missing anything. You're exactly asking the right question. And unfortunately, the answer is it depends because depending on what kind of agreement the customer signed, they may have signed a metered agreement, which means it'll be recognized as they use it. However, it will expire after a certain time period if they don't use it. When -- and that is what we call metered. On the other hand, to the extent that they have a subscription, then let's say, 1 month's worth is recognized and then another month whether they use it or not. So SaaS is almost always a subscription. PaaS can be either metered or a subscription. And so it is recognized differently. And that's it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John DiFucci (Analysts)】\nThat actually makes a ton of sense. It's really helpful. But just one quick question follow-up to that. If once -- if it's a metered PaaS deal and it expired -- expires, at that time, given the contract terms, the customers, does that -- do you recognize anything remaining on that contract at the time of expiration?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Safra Catz (Executives)】\nIf it's expired, let's say, they bought $100,000 metered, you could almost consider it a gift card. If they use it all on the first day, I book it all right then. If they don't use it at all, I book it when it expires.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Hurd (Executives)】\nJohn, I'll just add, on SaaS, just to make sure you understand what's happening as we get to Q3 because Safra talked about Q3 and Q4. So when we entered the SaaS market, we had a series of promotions, meaning that you would get some time to install. We had -- our strategy was to give you an incentive when you bought, that you had time to then implement and that promotion had a certain amount of time associated with it. Obviously, that was part of building up our reference base. Secondly, as we built up our reference base, we actually shortened the promotions. So that actually -- it actually went down by half the period of time. The 2 sets of promotions over the last couple of years, just by coincidence, coterminously end at the end of Q2. So the percent of the bookings that were on those types of promotions both end at the end of Q2 of this fiscal year. So that's why one of the reasons in SaaS, why you will see a jump in revenue that also will not be explained by bookings. So again, while you said I couldn't explain Q2 to bookings, you won't be able to explain exactly the alignment of the increase in revenue based on the bookings either because underneath it is this promotion. So there are multiple dimensions here. There's this promotion dimension. There's the dimension that Safra described, which is about a percent of our PaaS is metered and a percent of our PaaS is subscription. So there's a couple of different ways you can consume the PaaS. In addition to it, it takes a certain amount of time for us, in some cases -- I told you about a win, for example, last quarter at HSBC, a very large ERP in the cloud win. It will take us several months to fully provision that ERP for HSBC. So it's those factors together that formulate the conversion of the bookings to revenue.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John DiFucci (Analysts)】\nBut just to be clear...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Hurd (Executives)】\nI'll repeat one more time why we are so confident. We have the contracts, we know the expiration of the promotions. We know exactly when the PaaS expires, and in addition, you see all of that as it relates to deferred on the balance sheet.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John DiFucci (Analysts)】\nGreat. And just to be clear, Mark, once you start -- you're really giving, in the SaaS examples you gave, it's still once it starts to be -- you may delay the beginning, when you should begin to start recognizing the revenue, but it will be recognized as a subscription so evenly through the term.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Hurd (Executives)】\nYes, it is. It's a very important tool, John, because instead of discounting, you actually renew against a higher rate, and the promotion is basically a window by which you have time to get installed. And it's a very important tool as you're building up a reference base. And that's what we've done. Now the promotions over that period of time, call that a 2- or 3-year period of time, have declined and declined and declined. So the amount of promotion that's available on our SaaS portfolio is materially smaller than it was 2 years ago and materially smaller than it was a year ago. And so what happens is these things -- the confluence of events really come together in Q3, which is where you see this pop in our revenue. And then from there, you'll begin to see a more ratable alignment of bookings to revenue, sort of save the one point about the PaaS consumption that Safra was making.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ken Bond (Executives)】\nThank you, Mark. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours. Dial-in information can be found in the press release issued earlier today. Please call the Investor Relations department with follow-up questions from this call. We look forward to speaking with you. Thank you for joining us today, and with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for closing.",

      "transcript_text1": "Great, thank you. And thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex First Quarter Fiscal 2016 Earnings Release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer.\r\nThis morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the first quarter ended August 31, 2015, and our earnings release and Form 10-Q will be made available on our Investor Relations page at paychex.com. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 1 month.\r\nOn today's call, I'll review highlights for the first quarter in relation to operations, sales and product innovation. Efrain will review our first quarter financial results and discuss our full year guidance and then we'll open it up for your questions.\r\nWe're off to a good start in fiscal 2016 with positive results across our major product lines. We have continued our momentum in both sales and new product enhancements. Client satisfaction and client retention also remain at high levels. Payroll service revenue growth of 5% was in line with our expectations, and we also continue to see strong demand for our human resource outsourcing solutions, including double-digit growth in client worksite employees served. Total service revenue grew 8% in the first quarter. \r\nI want to mention, very important to us that Paychex was recognized as a Leader in the July 2015 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Payroll Business Outsourcing Services, advancing from our Challenger position in 2014. The 2015 Magic Quadrant evaluates the capabilities of 12 key providers of payroll BPO services across the globe, and I'd like to read to you some of the facts that came out of Gartner's release. Paychex ranked highest of all participating providers in overall satisfaction across payroll functions, technology, provider customer relationship and payroll BPO service outcomes. Our strengths, according to Gartner and our clients -- the survey of our clients, was a clear focus on our target market, ease of implementation and use and investment and innovation. Paychex's integrated HCM platform, Paychex Flex, better aligns its technologies internally, and the company has demonstrated significant innovation in mobile phone and tablet apps. We're very proud of this and the fact that the Leader designation by Gartner means that we execute well against current vision and are well positioned for the future. So we're very proud of that and I'm very proud of the entire Paychex team that was instrumental in achieving this designation. It fits a lot of what we have been talking about over the last few years about our significant increased investment in innovation and product.\r\nThe launch last year of Paychex Flex, our cloud-based integrated human capital management platform, provides us the ability to deliver a streamlined and integrated workforce management solution to a broad range of clients. This platform gives our clients the features and functionality they need today and also allows them to easily add services as their needs change. And the Gartner designation as an innovation Leader is the result of our commitment to that investment in both technology and client service, focusing on the clients and the total value proposition to them.\r\nAt our Investor Day in July, many of you had the opportunity to learn more about Paychex Flex and our integrated software-as-a-service solution suite of HCM products. We are very proud of our leading-edge technology and the strength of Paychex Flex is that it's a single platform utilizing a single employee record in addition to a number of client service options.\r\nWe recently launched our Paychex Flex Hiring module, which gives employers access to paperless recruiting and employee screening, along with a robust onboarding model for a seamless flow of information and data access. At HR Tech, we plan to announce additional enhancements to Flex with the integration of employee benefits and time and attendance functionality, which will round out the HCM suite. We now have the most robust mobility offerings for both administrative users and employee self-service that allow access to all of our HCM suite from a single mobile application.\r\nLast fiscal year, we launched our full-service Paychex Employer Shared Responsibility Service to assist clients navigating the Affordable Care Act. Our ESR product includes a monthly monitoring service with automatic alerts, as well as year-end reporting on Forms 1094 and 1095. We are pleased with the level of continued client acceptance that we have experienced.\r\nThe positive momentum we saw in fiscal 2015 in sales execution has continued solidly into 2016. Our integrated team-selling approach continues to produce strong results by introducing a full suite of product value that Paychex can offer our clients upfront.\r\nOur execution in service operations has continued its standard of excellence, demonstrated by strong client satisfaction results and client retention levels that remain consistent with recent highs. Our innovative leading-edge technology, coupled with this exceptional client service, makes us different in the market and it's what we focus on.\r\nWe have also continued to take steps to add additional value to our shareholders. In July, we increased our quarterly dividend 11% to $0.42 a share, maintaining a very competitive dividend yield, one of the highest in our industry. We have also continued to repurchase Paychex stock and acquired another 1.3 million shares of common stock in the first quarter of '16 -- fiscal '16. \r\nIn summary, we're off to a solid start for sales, service, product strength and financial performance for fiscal 2016 and I appreciate the great work of the 13,000 Paychex employee team across the country. I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results in more detail. Efrain?\n\n---\n\nThanks, Marty, good morning to all of you. I'd like to remind everyone that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and, as such, involve some risk. Refer to the usual disclaimers. \r\nAs Marty indicated, our first quarter financial results for fiscal 2016 show we're off to a solid start for the year. Here's some of the key highlight for the quarter. I'll provide greater detail in certain areas and wrap with a review of our 2016 outlook.\r\nTotal service revenue grew 8% for the first quarter to $712 million. Interest on funds held for clients increased 6% for the first quarter to $11 million. Now we've had a number of quarters in a row where we've strung together increases on funds held for clients. So that part of the P&L is starting to bounce back. This was driven in part by a 2% increase in average investment balances.\r\nExpenses increased 7% for the first quarter, primarily driven by higher compensation-related costs and growth in our PEO. The increase in compensation-related costs was driven by higher wages and performance-based comp costs.\r\nOperating income, net of certain items, increased 11% to $285 million for the quarter. We achieved operating margins of 40%, up from 39% in the prior year quarter. Remember that our operating margins typically are higher in the first half of the year. At this stage in the year, we anticipate our full year operating margin will fall within the guidance we have provided. We'll update again, of course, in Q2.\r\nOur effective income tax rate was 29.7% for the first quarter compared to 36.3% last year. This change is due to the recognition of a net tax benefit on income derived in prior years from customer-facing software we produced. \r\nDuring the past quarter, we engaged leading specialists in the area to assess the qualification on our software for the federal \"qualified production activities deduction.\" Based on this assessment, we concluded that certain of our software offerings qualified for this tax deduction in prior years and, therefore, recognized the tax benefits and related tax reserves as a discrete item during the period. This action dovetails with Marty's comments. We are a technology-enabled service provider and our spending, our costs, reflect this, as does the recognition we are receiving in the marketplace. \r\nNet income increased 22% to $209 million and diluted earnings per share increased 23% to $0.58 per share. The net tax benefit I just mentioned resulted in an increase in diluted EPS of $0.06. Let me emphasize again that the impact to diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.06. That's what we expect it will be through the year as you look at your models. Obviously, that was not contemplated in the guidance we gave. Excluding this net tax benefit, both net income and diluted earnings per share would have increased 11%. \r\nPayroll service revenue increased 5% for the first quarter to $433 million. We benefited from increases in revenue per check and client base. In addition, we had one additional payroll processing day in the first quarter compared to the same quarter last year.\r\nRevenue per check as a result of pricing -- I'm sorry, revenue per check grew as a result of price increases net of discounting. And on the payroll service revenue, I'd just remind you what we said last quarter that we think that the addition of extra days will result in approximately 0.5% to the growth in payroll service revenue for the year. We won't break it down by quarters.\r\nHRS revenue grew 15% to $280 million for the first quarter. This increase reflects strong growth in both clients and worksite employees of Paychex HR Services, which includes our ASO and PEO products. Insurance services benefited from continued growth of our full-service ESR product assisting clients with health care reform, an increase in health and benefits applicants and higher average premiums and clients in our workers' compensation insurance product. Our HR administration and time and attendance products contributed to the growth through sales of success of these solutions. And as I mentioned at the Investor Day, these products are typically sold as part of the bundle in our payroll packages. Retirement services revenue benefited from an increase in the number of plans and an increase in asset fee revenue earned on the value of participants' funds. \r\nTurning to our investment portfolio. Our goal is to predict -- protect principal and optimize liquidity. On the short-term side, primary short-term investment vehicles were bank-demand deposit accounts, high quality commercial paper and variable rate demand notes. In our longer-term portfolio, we continue to invest primarily in high-credit-quality municipal bonds, corporate bonds and U.S. government securities. Our long-term portfolio has an average yield of 1.7% and average duration of 3.3 years. Our combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 1% for the first quarter. And as I mentioned again, in the last year's quarter, we have not factored in into our guidance any changes in the interest rate environment, although it's looking like that will happen in either Q2 or Q3. Average balances for interest on funds held for clients increased during the first quarter, primarily driven by growth in our client base.\r\nI'll now walk you through the results of our financial position. It remains strong with cash and total corporate investments of $954 million as of August 2015 and we have no debt. Funds held for clients as of August were $3.7 billion compared to $4.3 billion as of May 31, 2015. However, funds held for clients vary widely on a day-to-day basis and averaged $3.8 billion for the quarter, a year-over-year increase of 2%. And it's the average that counts.\r\nOur total available-for-sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients, reflected net unrealized gains of $24 million as of the end of August compared with the net unrealized gain of $14 million as of the end of May.\r\nTotal stockholders' equity was $1.8 billion as of August, reflecting $152 million in dividends paid during the first quarter and 63 million of common shares repurchased. Our return on equity for the past 12 months was 38%.\r\nOur cash flows from operations were $278 million for the first quarter, an increase of 6% over the prior year period. This change is primarily a result of higher net income, partially offset by fluctuations in operating assets and liabilities. The fluctuation in operating assets and liabilities were primarily related to the timing of collections from clients and payments for compensation PEO payroll, and income taxes working capital was what created the change there in our cash flows.\r\nI'd like to remind you that our outlook is based upon our current view of economic and interest rate conditions continue with no significant changes. And I just mentioned, we're anticipating that at some point during the year that the Fed will raise rates. With that proviso, our guidance for fiscal 2016 is as follows: Payroll service revenue continues to be anticipated in the range of 4% to 5%. HRS revenue growth is anticipated to be the range of 10% to 13%, although we were higher, obviously, in Q1. We think that there'll be moderation in growth rates as the year progresses. Total service revenue is anticipated to be in the range of 7% to 8%, and net income growth is anticipated to be in the range of 8% to 9%. Remember, please, that I called out the change in the discrete tax item, which was $0.06. So our range excludes the benefit of the net tax benefit we recorded in the first quarter.\r\nOur effective tax rate for the year, excluding the impact of the net tax benefit discussed, will be approximately 36%. Our interest on funds held for clients and operating income net of certain items as a percentage of service revenue are expected to be consistent with prior guidance, and all other aspects of guidance that we discussed on the Q4 call are unchanged. \r\nI will now turn it back to Marty.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Efrain. And now, operator, we will open the call to questions.",

We are a technology-enabled service provider and our spending, our costs, reflect this, as does the recognition we are receiving in the marketplace. \r\nNet income increased 22% to $209 million and diluted earnings per share increased 23% to $0.58 per share. The net tax benefit I just mentioned resulted in an increase in diluted EPS of $0.06. Let me emphasize again that the impact to diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.06. That's what we expect it will be through the year as you look at your models. Obviously, that was not contemplated in the guidance we gave. Excluding this net tax benefit, both net income and diluted earnings per share would have increased 11%. \r\nPayroll service revenue increased 5% for the first quarter to $433 million. We benefited from increases in revenue per check and client base. In addition, we had one additional payroll processing day in the first quarter compared to the same quarter last year.\r\nRevenue per check as a result of pricing -- I'm sorry, revenue per check grew as a result of price increases net of discounting. And on the payroll service revenue, I'd just remind you what we said last quarter that we think that the addition of extra days will result in approximately 0.5% to the growth in payroll service revenue for the year. We won't break it down by quarters.\r\nHRS revenue grew 15% to $280 million for the first quarter. This increase reflects strong growth in both clients and worksite employees of Paychex HR Services, which includes our ASO and PEO products. Insurance services benefited from continued growth of our full-service ESR product assisting clients with health care reform, an increase in health and benefits applicants and higher average premiums and clients in our workers' compensation insurance product. Our HR administration and time and attendance products contributed to the growth through sales of success of these solutions. And as I mentioned at the Investor Day, these products are typically sold as part of the bundle in our payroll packages. Retirement services revenue benefited from an increase in the number of plans and an increase in asset fee revenue earned on the value of participants' funds. \r\nTurning to our investment portfolio. Our goal is to predict -- protect principal and optimize liquidity. On the short-term side, primary short-term investment vehicles were bank-demand deposit accounts, high quality commercial paper and variable rate demand notes. In our longer-term portfolio, we continue to invest primarily in high-credit-quality municipal bonds, corporate bonds and U.S. government securities. Our long-term portfolio has an average yield of 1.7% and average duration of 3.3 years. Our combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 1% for the first quarter. And as I mentioned again, in the last year's quarter, we have not factored in into our guidance any changes in the interest rate environment, although it's looking like that will happen in either Q2 or Q3. Average balances for interest on funds held for clients increased during the first quarter, primarily driven by growth in our client base.\r\nI'll now walk you through the results of our financial position. It remains strong with cash and total corporate investments of $954 million as of August 2015 and we have no debt. Funds held for clients as of August were $3.7 billion compared to $4.3 billion as of May 31, 2015. However, funds held for clients vary widely on a day-to-day basis and averaged $3.8 billion for the quarter, a year-over-year increase of 2%. And it's the average that counts.\r\nOur total available-for-sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients, reflected net unrealized gains of $24 million as of the end of August compared with the net unrealized gain of $14 million as of the end of May.\r\nTotal stockholders' equity was $1.8 billion as of August, reflecting $152 million in dividends paid during the first quarter and 63 million of common shares repurchased. Our return on equity for the past 12 months was 38%.\r\nOur cash flows from operations were $278 million for the first quarter, an increase of 6% over the prior year period. This change is primarily a result of higher net income, partially offset by fluctuations in operating assets and liabilities. The fluctuation in operating assets and liabilities were primarily related to the timing of collections from clients and payments for compensation PEO payroll, and income taxes working capital was what created the change there in our cash flows.\r\nI'd like to remind you that our outlook is based upon our current view of economic and interest rate conditions continue with no significant changes. And I just mentioned, we're anticipating that at some point during the year that the Fed will raise rates. With that proviso, our guidance for fiscal 2016 is as follows: Payroll service revenue continues to be anticipated in the range of 4% to 5%. HRS revenue growth is anticipated to be the range of 10% to 13%, although we were higher, obviously, in Q1. We think that there'll be moderation in growth rates as the year progresses. Total service revenue is anticipated to be in the range of 7% to 8%, and net income growth is anticipated to be in the range of 8% to 9%. Remember, please, that I called out the change in the discrete tax item, which was $0.06. So our range excludes the benefit of the net tax benefit we recorded in the first quarter.\r\nOur effective tax rate for the year, excluding the impact of the net tax benefit discussed, will be approximately 36%. Our interest on funds held for clients and operating income net of certain items as a percentage of service revenue are expected to be consistent with prior guidance, and all other aspects of guidance that we discussed on the Q4 call are unchanged. \r\nI will now turn it back to Marty.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nThank you, Efrain. And now, operator, we will open the call to questions.",
      "transcript_text3": "Two if I may. Let me start off, Marty, to what extent the full year guidance is just being more conservative? And given you have such a strong start to the year, are you expecting second and third quarters to slow down? And is that going to be related to more processing days or something more to think about?\n\n---\n\nS.K., this is Efrain. I'll take that. So the -- we're always glad to have a strong start to the year. That helps and increases our confidence in the guidance for the year. But one quarter doesn't make a year. I will say, also, that we called out that Q3 was going to be somewhat weaker than the other quarters. So there probably is an element of conservatism in our guidance. But at this point, we're not going to peg it any higher. We'll update in Q2 as we see results for the year come in.\n\n---\n\nOkay, that's great. Probably just a second question. With regards to what you guys were talking about in Investor Day. The focus clearly seems to be on generating more revenue per client. But client growth also is something which should probably benefit from sales and marketing investments. Are you seeing any progress on that? Or would you say that from your end, it's very clearly going to be just revenue per client and client per growth would -- should stay at 2% to 3% outside [ph] at best?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think -- no, I think we're seeing progress on both. We don't give the client growth until the end of the year, once a year. But it's very consistent. I think we're showing consistency in both, where the team's selling, the integrated selling upfront is doing well on the revenue side from the packages and, of course, the new products that we're rolling out. But it's also driving more interest in more clients and selling more clients. We'd always like it as strong as it could be and it's early. And selling season will tell us a lot more here in the next quarter. So -- but we're pushing hard for both and we're making progress on both.\n\n---\n\nProbably just last one on the competitive landscape. Have you seen any changes at all, given the acceleration in investments by a lot of the newer start-ups, especially in the payroll space?\n\n---\n\nNot really. I think, we continue to see good results from a selling perspective. And so while they're out there, I don't think anyone has -- no one has the sales team that we have, the distribution model and the number of sales people and the effectiveness. And so on the low end, I think they sell very effectively, and the low end being size. And then certainly in the mid-market, I think we're at the strongest -- we continue to be at the strongest position we've ever been in from a product and service perspective. So we really haven't seen a lot of changes. If anything, I would say we're in a better position than we were last year at this time.\n\n---\n\nCould you gauge net price increases that you're realizing, both in the payroll services and human resources services business this year?\n\n---\n\nYes, a little bit different on HRS. And we typically don't get real specific about how much we take. That's a little bit different typically from payroll services -- some day -- some years, I should say. We don't increase certain product lines. But I would say on payroll services, we're solidly within the 2% to 4% guideline and don't appear to be having any probably holding that -- those price increases.\n\n---\n\nGot it. And could you ballpark for us what the bookings growth was in the quarter?\n\n---\n\nNo, we won't do that. It was strong. We feel pretty good about it. I'd just say this, David, not to be too coy, because I got that question all the time. What really matters is how we did in the selling season. And so much of -- you can have a good quarter and we've had good quarters in the past, first and second, and not had a good selling season in third quarter. So we feel pretty encouraged about where we started the year. We think it bodes well for selling season. But we're not in selling season yet and we'll update when we get there.\n\n---\n\nYes, I think that's right, Efrain. Very consistently, we feel very good about it as we did at the end of the year and didn't have any bumps, getting off to a good start. But as Efrain said, the selling season makes the difference for us.\n\n---\n\nFirst question's on the PEO space. One of your competitors has recently seen higher medical claims cost. And even though you guys haven't experienced this, given you're exposed to different states, can you talk about whether or not that's impacted your view on taking insurance risk?\n\n---\n\nYes, good question. So we saw the same. We saw the same things that have been seen in the market -- or we saw the results, I should say. Our experience is very different. We employ teams of actuaries and set our premiums -- premium expense very, very conservatively. So there's no guarantee. You can have a hiccup, but we do a lot to minimize it. We also have a pretty low -- we have pretty conservative ceilings for reinsurance. And I think, all of that is great. But I think the most critical part of the entire equation is what you do from an underwriting standpoint when a client is presented to you. One of the things that we did -- this was before I got here [ph], and one of the things that Marty instituted was a very clear line between the authority that underwriters have and sales have. While they operate cooperatively, we task our underwriters with protecting the quality of the pool, and that has served us very well. So there is inherent risk in that area, but I think we manage it very well. When we looked at what others were doing and how they had structured their approach to risk, it was a bit different from what we do.\n\n---\n\nOkay, and maybe continuing on the PEO side, can you provide more details on the growth rate of your worksite employee count and whether that's still in the 20s?\n\n---\n\nYes, we won't update the worksite employee account -- count to give you specific numbers. We'll eventually release all of that information. But I would say it is fair to say that part of the reason why Q1 results were strong was that PEO was an element of strength in the quarter. So we continue to do very well in that area.\n\n---\n\nWanted to just pick up on the PEO topic as well here to start. The momentum that you're seeing there, I mean, to what extent do you think it's coming from share gains versus the general rising tide lifting a lot of boats just given the catalyst of the Affordable Care Act?\n\n---\n\nI think, obviously, a lot of it is coming from the Affordable Care Act. I think there's just a lot of interest in the market. But I think at the same time, because we're kind of a proven leader in this space and I have a very good sales team on this. I think we're picking up more share of what's now becoming a PEO sale. So I would say it's, Jason, it's a bit of both because there's such an interest now, particularly as it's getting closer and closer for the -- to respond to the Affordable Care Act from a PEO standpoint, frankly, and an insurance standpoint. And because of our positioning of our product and our success, we're picking up more share.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then just switching gears over to Flex Hiring. If we try and just get a bead on sort of magnitude of contribution, obviously, it's an important offering. Is there material revenue baked into this year's guidance for it? Or should we think of it as more of a potentially material contributor in fiscal '17?\n\n---\n\nI'd say, yes, probably more of a contributor in '17 because it's going to take a while to build up, but it's adding a lot of strength to the packages that we're providing. It's -- not only is it giving them full recruiting and hiring, but we're selling -- we sell onboarding as even a separate offering, which is a paperless onboarding that doesn't have to be a mid-market sale. It can be a 20 person of it hires a lot and it's all paperless from an onboarding perspective. So I'd say this year, it's kind of getting started and you'll see a start to it. But the bigger magnitude of it will come in future years and starting in '17.\n\n---\n\nAnd just last one for me. I wanted to catch up on the M&A pipeline because it felt for a period of time like you guys had sort of opened the aperture a little bit in terms of opportunities you were willing to consider. Obviously, staying disciplined in evaluating those opportunities, but would you say there's been any directional move in the pipeline in terms of it being closer to bearing fruit versus not in recent months?\n\n---\n\nYes, I'd say so. Although, you never know until you get to the finish line. But we certainly have been very active in a number of fronts on it. And -- but as you said, we're still very being disciplined. So we have a pretty wide funnel at the beginning. We bring it down pretty tightly to where we think it's a reasonable valuation, whether it's going to add a lot of value to us. And -- but we've got to -- there's a few things in the hopper now that we're evaluating. Do they get over the finish line? You never know until we're ready to announce. But we're very active in it. That's for sure.\n\n---\n\nMarty, I wanted to ask you about the Paychex Flex and the percentage of customers that have converted to that particular version of payroll processing.\n\n---\n\nIt's hard -- the basic product that we have was Paychex Next Generation. All clients are on Paychex Next Gen. Then Flex adds kind of a -- another full product suite to that. So we're in the process of moving some of the clients over. But there's a number of clients that are already on what I would say is the foundation of it. So a lot of clients are not going to see -- the majority of our clients are not going to see any movement. They're not being moved to anything, unless they drive -- this is more of a mid-market product suite that are going to see more, and they're being offered that. We're still offering the old product suite. What we're saying is, \"Hey, if you want to come over to a fully -- a full suite for human capital management that is fully integrated within a single-employee record, we will move you over.\" So we're kind of in the early stages of that. But it's not a big push to force everybody over. It's more, \"Hey, if you want these additional enhancements, come over,\" and it's really targeted more in that mid-market space. The majority of our clients won't see a move, so there's not going to be any disruption that we expect there at all.\n\n---\n\nYes, I guess, again to Marty, is there -- have you seen a -- have you experienced greater sales of products as people have moved over to Flex, especially in the mid-market, considering there'll probably more demand for some of your products?\n\n---\n\nYes, it's early but I think, yes. I mean, that's what they're looking for. And so we're -- that's why we're excited with the Gartner change to put us as a Leader, because that's what they're looking for, is that full suite of products, fully integrated, single-employee record and database. And we are seeing an increased demand there. And I think, if you were to talk to the sales team, particularly in the mid-market, we just left the sales conference of our top performers a few weeks ago and extreme excitement about selling the product and being very competitive in the marketplace. So I think, it's early, but you'll start to see that really pick up and it will add, as we talked about a little bit earlier, much more product per client.\n\n---\n\nAnd then, Efrain, just any change in philosophy in how you manage a float portfolio, considering there might be interest rate increases going forward here?\n\n---\n\nNot yet, but it's on my list of objectives. So Kartik, what we need to know is when they're going to raise and then what the increase in the -- the rate of increase will be. And I think the Fed's been signaling as directly as I've ever heard them signal when it's going to happen. And I expect that when they signal their -- or when they implement their first increase, they'll give some direction as to what we can expect then in subsequent increases. That will permit you to decide how to position duration of the portfolio. So I'm waiting for all of that information to get a better sense of how we sit down and strategize around the best way to position the portfolio. So that's coming in the -- probably in the second half of the year.\n\n---\n\nThe first question is just -- you said you just came from a sales conference. I was curious what feedback you heard from your salespeople. Any potential changes to client behavior given the financial market weakness and also some of the concerns about the global economy?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think, generally -- and we release a monthly small business index and in fact, I was just in New York City yesterday because we've expanded it now for different industries. We're seeing continued -- particularly in the small business, under 50, we're seeing continued better employment growth than prerecession levels in 2004. And so -- and it's down a little bit from last year, but it's consistently above that level. So we're feeling like a steady improvement in small business formation and employment hiring. And I would say the sales folks certainly felt that way. I think, the bigger excitement at the sales conference was just about the products that we're rolling out and the full feature and the strength of the competitive offering, along with the service options, now 7-by-24 service and a lot of different options that -- more self-service that clients can provide. So they were pretty excited, first, to be there. Obviously, they're top performers; and second, that they got a good year in front of them, they feel.\n\n---\n\nAnd then on the ESR offering that you have, just wondering if you could sort of give an update on how that's progressing. What percentage of the clients that you think might take it have taken it so far? And does it feel like it's going to be a \"down to the wire\" type of offering where people take it at the very end?\n\n---\n\nYes, sure. I don't -- we don't really release, I don't think, how many are taking it from -- yet at this point. I would say it's very active. And I think it will be active down to the end. We continue to provide it to our clients. I know some competitors have stopped providing it. If there's a lot of work involved, then we're making sure that the clients upfront understand it. There's a lot of information needed from the client for us to do this successfully for them. But I think we're handling it very well. We've increased the resources who are selling it. We've increased the resources who are supporting it, because we're continuing to operate. And I think, this will be -- yes, I think, this will be pretty active right through the end of the year. And I think, then there'll be another surge, probably after, of people who -- clients who realized, \"Hey, I should have had this when it comes time to file and now I need it.\" So I think we'll have kind of another resurgence of sales, probably in kind of the end of the first or second calendar quarter of next year. But it's going very well. It's going very well.\n\n---\n\nFirst question. You've talked a lot about the success in selling bundled offerings in recent years. But one thing I don't think we've heard as much commentary on is just how you approach upselling additional components of products into the base? And what the success has been in doing so? Any commentary you can provide on that?\n\n---\n\nYes, sure. Because, Gary, one of the points I've tried to make is one of the things we shifted. Typically our model was sell payroll and then the other sales forces with the other products come in kind of after that pretty much on a timetable basis. You get someone comfortable with payroll then you come in and talk to them about their -- the value of a 401(k) record keeping, about the value of HR outsourcing, insurances, et cetera. Now what we found is certain client sizes and complexity of the client, we come into that client with an integrated team selling approach over the last, I'd say, year, 1.5 years now and it's been very successful. So what we found was, we were not selling the full value of what the client was looking for many times in our old approach. And so if we see a client that's a certain number of employees, has a certain hiring pattern, has a certain complexity to their business, we'll go in with multiple sales forces or multiple sales products and sell them all at the same time, and that's been going very well. It's -- I think, once we got the sales teams comfortable with it, they've been more successful and we're getting a nice track record as we get this -- as we get some real momentum going.\n\n---\n\nLet me build on that, what Marty said. So that's the team selling approach. On the other side of it, we've done a lot of data analysis, a lot of modeling based on predictive behavior modeling. And we have models that basically predict what your -- the next best offering will be when you don't take a bundle. So that science keeps getting better and better. So we know at certain stages of your life cycle, and based on what products you're doing and the characteristics of -- your client characteristics, your customer characteristics, what offering is likely to be the most successful. So we deploy those models out to the sales force, too. So both of those have -- approaches have helped us become more efficient.\n\n---\n\nIs that a telesales, the selling of more stuff to existing customers? Or is it your feet on the street?\n\n---\n\nNo, it's -- actually, it's more of the feet on the street. It's -- I mean, I think, we're much more effective on the telesales side as well, but that's been really more for the single product sale or a follow-up sale. But the feet on the street have a been much more on the integrated team selling approach because we have many offices that obviously have multiple sales teams, but they just kind of approach the client at different stages. And now if the client is the right -- looks like the right fit for multiple products, they'll go out and sell as a team, and we're finding some good success in that.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then just the 15% HRS growth, obviously, continues to be really good, but is that a clean like-for-like number, or was there a little bit of benefit still from the mix with the minimum premium health plan? Or is that really [indiscernible]\n\n---\n\nNo, there's always going to be a little bit of benefit from MPP, but that wasn't a significant part of what happened. Actually, because you were -- we had the same product mix in the quarter, but MPP really did not dramatically impact that number. It really was strength of PEO, strength of ESR and strength frankly across a lot of other HRS products.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then just the last one, I know you've talked about M&A, but you're going to do things only if you can get the right price and whatnot. How shall we think about just the cash build from here? Are you likely -- I think, you've indicated special dividends didn't seem of real interest. I know you've been doing some buybacks, but a lot less than your cash flow. Should we think that the likely approach is just continuing to build cash until you do find the M&A? Are there any other options that you're [indiscernible]\n\n---\n\nYes, Gary, I get this question a lot. And what's difficult -- my answer always is the same. What's difficult for the Street to evaluate what we're doing is you don't have insight into the pipeline and the probability of our pulling the trigger on deals. I will say that most -- you can assume that most of the deals that occur in the fintech space of any reasonable size we've looked at. And that for whatever reason, we've decided on a valuation that didn't permit us to get to the finish line because we're pretty disciplined about how we go about it. Having said all of that, the pipeline, as Marty said, is pretty robust. And so we see a number of opportunities that we like and would prefer to simply have the cash to move quickly and deploy it in first instance to the extent that we got to a point where really the pipeline looked -- didn't look as robust, then I think that we'd start looking at other ways to deploy cash to shareholders. But part of the way we do that and part of our confidence in the future is that in the summer, we boosted dividend pretty significantly. And we have been buying back shares. If you look at our share count, vis-à-vis the last quarter, you see our -- the bias is downward, which is something that we started a couple of years. So all 3 of those are elements to how we're looking at cash. But in terms of large cash outlay beyond dividends, we think the pipeline, there's opportunities there, in the space. And we think that, that valuations have come down to a point where there's a number of things -- opportunities that seem reasonable now that maybe weren't reasonable 18 to 24 months ago.\n\n---\n\nIt sounds like your margins outperformed in the first quarter versus your internal plans. Is that fair? And if yes, could you talk about what drove the upside?\n\n---\n\nBoy, Sara, that's a pretty interesting deduction. Yes, they were a little bit stronger than we had anticipated. However, I would say this, so there's 2 elements that always typically in the first quarter, we're trying to peg how quickly we go out of the gate in spending, and so it's typically the case that we're a little bit slower. So some of that is timing, I would say. And then we did well on sales. We feel pretty positive about that. We still don't think it's enough throughout. We're still not confident enough throughout the remainder of the year to call it as an upside to where we are, but we certainly had a strong start to the quarter -- to the year, I should say.\n\n---\n\nOkay, great. And then switching gears back to health care reform and the ACA product. It sounds like it continues to grow strong and you think that, that could continue for a couple of more quarters? How much of a lift is it to the average revenue per client?\n\n---\n\nI don't think we've really -- from a competitive standpoint, we haven't given out all of pricing and so forth, so I'd be careful I guess -- I don't want to say too much, but I would say it's a significant increase. It's a pretty significant -- it's -- I don't know [indiscernible].\n\n---\n\nGood uplift, and you see it in HRS. So.\n\n---\n\nYes, yes. And we're seeing a lot of success with it. I'm not trying to be coy about it, but I just want to be careful how I'm talking about the pricing of it because there's a lot of discussion about pricing of Affordable Care Act and there's a lot of different plans out there right now that people are saying they're doing certain things and I think clients got to look very carefully at pricing and what they're getting for the product that they're buying because some are giving them a lot. Yes, I think we're giving them a very full-valued service and others are kind of giving them a form to fill in. And I think that's what may shake out here toward the end is clients are going to be a little surprised maybe at what they bought and what they didn't buy. But it continues to have really nice momentum for us. Sales are doing well with it. A number of sales teams are selling it. And as Efrain said, you're really seeing it in the HRS revenue uplift.\n\n---\n\nBut I -- one thing I'd add to that, Sara, that PEO was strong, ASO was strong, HR outsourcing, in general, was strong too. So what ESR has done is it, it's had a bit of a halo effect on a number of other products. Even when you don't sell the product, it permits you to get in the door to have a conversation. I think there are very few clients that won't entertain a call about what they're doing with respect to ACA compliance because there's so much confusion in the market about it.\n\n---\n\nOkay, great. And then last quarter, you'd said that you're about 1/4 to a 1/3 penetrated for potential clients that might take it. Is that as high now as half? Is it going that rapidly?\n\n---\n\nI think that's probably a reasonable range in terms of where we're at here. Where we end up is something that we're just monitoring to see.\n\n---\n\nYes, I think that's fair.\n\n---\n\nJust a couple more on the ACA. So I think you mentioned -- so that's an HRS revenue -- HR revenue, not payroll?\n\n---\n\nCorrect, yes, that's reported in HRS.\n\n---\n\nAnd have you recognized much revenue from that or does it get recognized as you kind of bring the clients on board? Or how will that like ramp-up? How should we think about that?\n\n---\n\nYes, so what you're seeing now is where we really started building in the back half of last year, so you start to see the benefit of that in this quarter. So you're starting to see the pickup from the number of clients that we signed on and that kind of will wash through as we go through the year and by the time we're at the end of the year, pretty close to having recognized most of it. Most of the increase, I should say.\n\n---\n\nBy year-end? And just on a different part of ACA, with a number of the public exchanges seeing pretty high price increases for their health products and eliminating products, any impact -- can you talk about that impact of that on you guys in this sort of fall-enrollment-type season?\n\n---\n\nI think it's got a couple of different impacts. One, we're not seeing an impact as much on the pure insurance sales basis too much yet because I haven't seen all of those increases aren't all out yet. They're -- you'll see them probably all of it by the end of this -- the next couple of weeks, actually, as they roll out. The other thing I would say is that because of the work in the PEO and the MPP plan, we've seen a very competitive low increases there for our products. And I think that's helped us a lot. That's part of the reason we took on a little bit more risk in that because we felt we could manage that very well and it's been very good for us on much -- I'd say much lower increases to our clients under those plans than the national averages certainly that we're seeing, or regional averages. So I think it's going -- it's been a benefit and will continue to be a benefit for us particularly in the PEO side where we have an MPP. And on the health insurance side, I haven't quite seen it yet, but clients aren't going to have a lot of choice there if they don't have -- in most cities, they're going to have carriers. They're all going double-digit increases, unfortunately. So -- but we haven't seen a big impact to slow anything down from an insurance standpoint.\n\n---\n\nKind of an obscure question here. About a month or so ago, the National Labor Relations Board had a ruling that people believe could, in fact, affect the franchise business where unions are going to be able to negotiate with the franchisors. If I remember correctly, you do a lot of work in the franchise area, please correct me if I'm wrong, but if you do, have you heard or seen any impact, potential impact on your business accordingly?\n\n---\n\nYes, sure. We've not seen it yet. I mean, I do think that it's one of those things that's just another negative that's out there that it makes people a little bit slower on maybe hiring or starting up an additional franchise, let's say. If I own a couple of franchises, I might be just a little more cautious on whether I start another one or not based on that ruling. I think a lot of that's still got to shake out. But it's not -- it certainly adds more confusion and concern to those. We don't have a ton of franchise sales. When you look at -- in the scheme of our sales and our client base, but it's certainly increasing because we've done a lot of work in selling the franchise side, but that's been picking up. So I would say don't have an impact yet, but I do think it may generally put a little bit of a damper on whether I open up a second franchise or not.\n\n---\n\nYes, that's helpful. Is your franchise exposure on the payroll side, the HRS side or mixed?\n\n---\n\nMixed. Mixed, we sell all products to the franchises.\n\n---\n\nIt's Stephen Sheldon in for Tim. Most of my questions have been answered, but I just want to ask, as we get a little closer to the key selling season, can you maybe talk generally about where the sales force currently stands? And have you been doing much hiring? How recent hires have been ramping in terms of productivity? Just any color on how you're positioned there would be appreciated.\n\n---\n\nYes, I think we're in good shape going in from -- first of all from just being very -- we've got all the hires in, training is done. I think Mark Bottini and the leadership team did a great job in getting everyone in, kicking off the year really well. We have a sales kickoffs, a lot of training during the first quarter and so forth on new products. I think we're at a great positioning of training, for example. We do an awful lot now of web training and so forth. And from a client -- from a growth of sales, I would say we're up about normal like we normally add to the sales force. We had our adds and we were pretty much right on track. The good news is everybody is in the seats, well-trained and particularly with all the product changes, they're well versed in the product, and we could feel that and the momentum of it at that -- at the sales award conference.\n\n---\n\nCould you -- could we drill down just a little bit with regards to just the core payroll, the acceleration we saw this quarter. Did you say that there was like one extra processing period?\n\n---\n\nYes, one extra processing day. Yes.\n\n---\n\nAnd how much of an impact did that have?\n\n---\n\nGood question, Mark. I won't say specifically for the quarter, but we're going to have 2 of them this year, and we think that the impact will be 0.5%. So if you use arithmetic averages, you can figure out what the impact was.\n\n---\n\nJust to be specific, the 0.5% is for the total year?\n\n---\n\nCorrect, yes. Yes.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And the other quarter, that it will -- we'll see this impact will be?\n\n---\n\nA little bit -- is it the fourth quarter?\n\n---\n\nFourth.\n\n---\n\nThe fourth quarter.\n\n---\n\nThe fourth quarter?\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nOkay, great. And then you also mentioned that we should be cognizant on the third quarter?\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nWhat -- can you remind us?\n\n---\n\nYes, so I called that out. I'd just refer back to my comments in Q4. I called out, at this point, we think that, that quarter will be just -- it's more timing. I won't go into long amount of detail. I'll update in Q2, but that will be the weakest of the quarters. It's mostly about timing of different revenue flows within that quarter. And I called out HRS as potentially being below the range of the full year guidance. I said that in Q4. We'll update in Q2. But we expect Q3 will be, relatively speaking, the weaker of the 4 quarters in the year.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then with regards to this -- to the quarter that we just had on the core side, even when we strip out the impact of the processing, they were still doing well. Can you talk about the biggest single driver behind that in terms of -- you certainly saw pricing stick through. You've had good bookings. But what would you say would be the primary driver?\n\n---\n\nWell, I think, it's a combination of holding the price and retention. I mean, if you -- when you look at that immediate quarter, sales were obviously, we are very comfortable and positive on sales. But the impact is when you retain the clients and as I mentioned, we continue to be at our best client retention levels. And on top of that, we are holding the price increase in the range that Efrain gave. So it was a good start to the year. That's when you see kind of that, that first quarter, you kind of see what happened with the price and did we have to take more discounting and so forth. And we felt good about holding the price and felt very good about the client retention as well. Good job on the service team.\n\n---\n\nDid the retention ramp up at all?\n\n---\n\nSo we don't give -- I would say it's very consistent with where we ended the year which was a record high.\n\n---\n\nThe other thing, Mark, that I'd call out is we didn't say anything about checks per client. Obviously, there's a lot of other things to talk about that were positives. But checks per client were flat to down in the quarter. And so when you compare one quarter over another, we still were seeing positive results in checks per client through much of last year. We didn't see that benefit. That's a mix issue that I've called out in the past. So we feel pretty good about where we were from a payroll service revenue standpoint.\n\n---\n\nAbsolutely. And then with regards to just the client segments that you're seeing the strongest growth from. Is it -- would it typically be in the 6 employee to 11, or maybe a little bit slightly higher?\n\n---\n\nI'd say it's across the board. It's not like the quarter that we're seeing any one segment pick up better. That's -- the good news to us is we're doing well in the -- let's say our typical under-20 segment. And we're also doing well and better, I think, even because of the product and the service options in the mid-market. So I'd say it's across the board.\n\n---\n\nAnd exclusive of that kind of the really small 1 to 4 where SurePayroll plays?\n\n---\n\nNo, that's included in the mid-market.\n\n---\n\nYes, that's included.\n\n---\n\nSo it's both.\n\n---\n\nAnd congrats on the upper quadrant. That's relatively early. Any sense for the ability of the sales force to leverage the improved recognition?\n\n---\n\nI think we're just -- yes, it's pretty recent. But we'll certainly find any way we can. They're certainly very excited about it because it's always exciting to see a third party, particularly like Gartner puts you in that leadership position and that it's based on our clients being surveyed and our clients saying, \"Hey, this is a great product and a great service.\" And then Gartner coming out of it saying, \"Hey, not only is it good now, but you're a leader because you are positioned well for the future.\" So I will definitely be looking to capitalize on it. And knowing the sales team, they're well trained and well versed. And the things that are happening with Paychex, they'll be able to capitalize on it well.\n\n---\n\nAnd the other thing, Mark, I'd add to that is that Marty's strategy really started 7 years ago about investing in IT. And I just want to reiterate 2 things. One is that, this is part of the strategy of how we move Paychex from where we were pre-recession to where we are right now. And I think, it's been a long time in the making, number one. And second, I think that external validation is a lot better and more powerful than simply trumpeting what you think -- what you believe about yourself. So I would say there's a lot of smack talk by competition about how good they are. We don't talk that way except right now. And we prefer to let third parties validate how good we are and let our customers validate how we good we are. We could not have had that honor unless our customers thought very highly about what we do. That's the second point. And then the third point is that a lot of our spending -- now our increases in spending have been around IT. And it helped us from the standpoint of being able to go and may build a credible case that we were entitled to a certain treatment of the expenses we were making based on the strategy that we employed. So I think, it validates a lot of different things that the management team has put in place.\n\n---\n\nQuick question on the team-selling approach. As you've implemented that over the last year, 1.5 years, can you dimensionalize sort of the range, the upside you are seeing in revenue per client when you're able to sell in the fuller suite of services?\n\n---\n\nI think, it's pretty significant when you sell it upfront. It's also a timing thing, remember, because I would assume that we're -- normally, we're selling those other products but a little bit further down the road. But we're finding, one, we're selling more of it upfront. Two, I think, by offering the total package, we're selling more of it because were hitting the client at a time that they see the full value more than just selling them payroll then coming back later. I don't know if we'd give the exact percentage or anything, but it's certainly double-digit increase in a -- over the kind of the revenue per client that we would normally see upfront. We just want to get more of that over time, but then I do think we're having more success. We may have -- we thought we may have been missing some opportunities, actually, by selling kind of a payroll only and then coming back later when the client upfront may have felt better particularly today in saying, \"Gee, I really wanted HR outsourcing altogether. I wanted a PEO or an ASO offering. And that's what I really needed. I need it.\" And that's what we're finding because that's come down a lot in employee size, and so it fit the team selling very, very well.\n\n---\n\nTerrific. Good. And then just one quick follow-up on retention. You -- I think you said that -- I just want to confirm, you said retention is kind of holding relatively stable?\n\n---\n\nYes, that's right.\n\n---\n\nJust on the HRS side, I heard there was a little bit better with PEO. The moderation comment for the rest of the year? Is there anything specific there that we should be aware of? Or is it just the previous comments on conservatism?\n\n---\n\nWell, first of all, there is some conservatism, so we'll come back in Q2 and update. But the other thing, Tien-tsin, is we had really strong -- we had really strong HRS growth in the back half of the year led by PEO. And when it start anniversary-ing some tougher compares and there's some revenue shifts going on within quarter particularly in Q3. So we want to get a little bit more of a sense of how the year is building before we do anything to guidance.\n\n---\n\nOkay, just wanted to make sure. And then just on the -- just one more, just on the back to minimum premium concept here. I know it's still on the earlier side for you, but have you given any sense of what the mix now is of minimum premium versus the fully insured plans in terms of what you're selling, what's taking, what's not?\n\n---\n\nIt's still less than 50% of what we sell in the PEO. And remember the reason why I say that is, that it's only in the state of Florida. So we have PEO business in Texas and California and a number of other important states. So -- and for the -- at least for the near future, that's where it will remain. But Marty mentioned earlier, and I think it was in response to a question about what's happening with health care premium increases, we're very, very competitively positioned. So we'll see and monitor how we do throughout the remainder of the year. We feel really good about both our underwriting standards and also what we've been able to do with that plan. So that could change as time goes on.\n\n---\n\nI was just hoping to follow up on a question I think that's been asked in several different ways over the course of the call, and that's really getting to this whole concept of unit versus revenue per client growth. And how we should think about how that's evolving? And I think you've given us several kind of data points on what's driving revenue per client, but fewer details on exactly how to think about that specifically in terms of percentages because -- and how to think about your model longer term in terms of how that could impact the growth rate. So perhaps -- I know that's a long-winded question, but perhaps you could give us some more information or insight into how that should evolve and impact the growth rate.\n\n---\n\nYes, I think, first of all, it's still very balanced. It's -- we're going after both. So -- and I think we've been, obviously, I think we probably went on the side of much more revenue per client growth the last few years as we added additional product. And so that makes the sales team very successful, and we all -- and we did well on raising the revenue per client -- excuse me, but that's because we had so much more product and product bundles and we're very successful with that. That kind of a shifted us back to, hey, how do you balance that? And so I think what you're finding is the sales team much more focused on compensation plans, et cetera, in training on both. Hey, we want to increase the units. I mean, we've talked about where we wanted to be in unit growth in the past, in net client growth. And we're continuing to push to get there, and we've seen very consistent -- consistency through the first quarter. We're trying to continue to balance both of those. We're feeling really good about the revenue per unit, continuing to increase because of the fuller product set in the offerings that we have and the success in selling it. And then -- and retaining it, by the way. And then the unit piece is we're finding other ways to do that, not only with the sales on the street, but from a more of a digital marketing and web-based product or web-based service, so more people coming in that way, buying more payroll only kind of thing and doing that with telesales. So I just want to make sure it's clear. Hey, we're looking to balance both. I think we're going to have success in both, but I would say the revenue per unit is what's been stronger the last couple of years. And that seems to continue. Efrain, anything you want to add it?\n\n---\n\nThat's right.\n\n---\n\nAnd so is the -- should we think of the unit growth being driven more, if you will, on the smaller client size who are perhaps using one product like payroll or is that an oversimplification?\n\n---\n\nI think that's oversimplification. I think we're pushing -- like I would just -- well, I would say that's typically, obviously, where we see most of the growth because 80% of the clients are still under 20. And half our sales come from brand-new businesses so that certainly is fair to say. But I would say we're feeling much better about the mid-market strength given the product suite, the human capital management full suite of products. So I think units are going to come from there as well. It's a little bit -- it's obviously a little bit longer sales cycle and so forth. So I would -- I think it's fair to say that -- since half the sales still come pretty much from brand-new businesses that the units are going to come from. At least half of them are coming from a smaller payroll only, generally, but I think you're going to continue to see the growth of the mid-market better than it has in the last few years because of the product suite.\n\n---\n\nRight. And then just one other follow-up question. It's again related to a question that's been asked several times. It's about the Affordable Care Act and how it's impacting the overall business. Can you guys give us a sense, I think, you said, Marty, that you saw a surge and then you're seeing -- you are expecting once you get into calendar '16, people may recognize they didn't do enough if I understood your comments correctly. Is that the way to think about it in terms of just very simple algebra in terms of the timing of when it could affect your business differently than it has in the last several quarters?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think so. I think, as Efrain said, I think as the sales come in now and they're -- I think for at this stage, they'll peak probably in November, October, November, the sales will, then you'll start to get the full revenue of that on a monthly basis right after that. And then clients, I think, clients will see because we talked about kind of the percentage that are taking it of the ones we think it applies to. I think clients will see in the March, April, probably the May time frame because the filings are in March. They'll start to see, \"Gee, I should have done more or it did apply to me and I didn't think so or I just didn't take the time to address it.\" I think sales will pick back up then. I'm not sure that will have a big impact in Q4 for us because it will be a little bit late in that process because I do think sales will pick back up in April and May for those who didn't take it. That's my guess at this point based on what we're seeing. Because some clients are just -- some are great. They're all over it. They're taking it. Others are waiting -- kind of late in the game, but I think we'll see that. Then I think you're going to see a number of them that say, \"I still don't get it. I'm not going to do anything until I have to.\" And then they're going to have to react in April.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then just one last question, just on the impact of potentially higher rates, Efrain. So it would appear at least in this fiscal year, given higher position, it would have a nominal impact. And then we would just factor in like you're going to stay short on the curve at least for the time being, or perhaps should we think about this a little bit differently if we do get an increase in rates over the next 6 months?\n\n---\n\nYes, David, I think you're right. Until I get a better sense of how that develops, it's really tough to figure out what the duration is whether we should barbell the duration, whether -- what the best value on the curve is. I mean, you can do a lot of modeling. We've looked at it, looking at forward rates so it doesn't really give you a sense of what's the best strategy to employ. So as soon as we get a sense of when they're going to raise and get better insight because I think the Fed should tell us then what the pace of change is going to be, then I think we can figure out what makes most sense in terms of configuring the portfolio.\n\n---\n\nJust wanted to ask about M&A further on that topic. So maybe you guys talked about the pipeline being busy. Perhaps maybe give us a little more color in terms of what types of opportunities you're considering, whether it's market expansionary, new products. And then also perhaps some commentary on size might be helpful in terms of how big the targets you're considering are.\n\n---\n\nI think from a -- I'll start the answer with the size standpoint. It's been anything from small to pretty large. I mean, that hasn't concerned us too much at all. The second thing is not as much about product now, adding product, because I think we've really done that with all the acquisitions we've done over the last few years. And frankly, that's what's exciting now is when you see recruiting -- we don't even mention this, but when you see recruiting and onboarding, roll into the Flex product suite, that's myStaffingPro, one of the best recruiting packages in the industry that we acquired a few years ago and now have built into our package, an integrated single database kind of thing. So I think we're pretty solid on product. It might be something there, but we're very solid on the full suite of products. And now it's expanding into other things that, I guess, either adding more client base so whether that's payroll companies, PEOs, et cetera, it's adding more and maybe a little bit of an offshoot of that, but not too far. So it goes small to large. It's not as much product as it is, I think, expanding our market share, and maybe going off a little bit different than what we are, but not too much.\n\n---\n\nYes, and just to build on what Marty said. So we typically have done smaller tuck-ins. Our largest acquisition, certainly, in the past 5 years was Sure and that was a little bit over $100 million. So when we say large, we're not talking about transformational opportunities. We're certainly looking at opportunities that are in the hundreds of millions of dollars, but not transformational. And there's a wide range of assets on the market that are of interest to us that are -- fall within that range.\n\n---\n\nWould you guys consider taking on debt to fund an acquisition? Or is that off the table?\n\n---\n\nWe've addressed that. The answer is if it was the right opportunity, we would consider it. So that's not off the table. We haven't seen too many of those. There've been some that were of interest to us. But again, one of the things that investors should expect when they invest in Paychex is we're not going to grow, buy things to grow the company in that way. We think we have a pretty solid business model with good organic growth characteristics and we think there are some assets out there that are of value that can help. But our strategy isn't to grow by acquisition, our strategy is to buy things and grow them.\n\n---\n\nAny more questions?\n\n---\n\nAll right. Thank you. At this point, we'll close the call. We're very proud of the team at Paychex and our first quarter results. If you're interested in replaying the webcast of this conference call, it will be archived until October 30. And just a reminder, our Annual Meeting of Stockholders will be held October 14, at 10:00 a.m. here in Rochester. That meeting will also be broadcast over the Internet. Thank you again for taking the time to participate in our first quarter press release conference call and for your interest in Paychex. Have a great day.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Siva Borra (Analysts)】\nTwo if I may. Let me start off, Marty, to what extent the full year guidance is just being more conservative? And given you have such a strong start to the year, are you expecting second and third quarters to slow down? And is that going to be related to more processing days or something more to think about?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nS.K., this is Efrain. I'll take that. So the -- we're always glad to have a strong start to the year. That helps and increases our confidence in the guidance for the year. But one quarter doesn't make a year. I will say, also, that we called out that Q3 was going to be somewhat weaker than the other quarters. So there probably is an element of conservatism in our guidance. But at this point, we're not going to peg it any higher. We'll update in Q2 as we see results for the year come in.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Siva Borra (Analysts)】\nOkay, that's great. Probably just a second question. With regards to what you guys were talking about in Investor Day. The focus clearly seems to be on generating more revenue per client. But client growth also is something which should probably benefit from sales and marketing investments. Are you seeing any progress on that? Or would you say that from your end, it's very clearly going to be just revenue per client and client per growth would -- should stay at 2% to 3% outside [ph] at best?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes, I think -- no, I think we're seeing progress on both. We don't give the client growth until the end of the year, once a year. But it's very consistent. I think we're showing consistency in both, where the team's selling, the integrated selling upfront is doing well on the revenue side from the packages and, of course, the new products that we're rolling out. But it's also driving more interest in more clients and selling more clients. We'd always like it as strong as it could be and it's early. And selling season will tell us a lot more here in the next quarter. So -- but we're pushing hard for both and we're making progress on both.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Siva Borra (Analysts)】\nProbably just last one on the competitive landscape. Have you seen any changes at all, given the acceleration in investments by a lot of the newer start-ups, especially in the payroll space?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nNot really. I think, we continue to see good results from a selling perspective. And so while they're out there, I don't think anyone has -- no one has the sales team that we have, the distribution model and the number of sales people and the effectiveness. And so on the low end, I think they sell very effectively, and the low end being size. And then certainly in the mid-market, I think we're at the strongest -- we continue to be at the strongest position we've ever been in from a product and service perspective. So we really haven't seen a lot of changes. If anything, I would say we're in a better position than we were last year at this time.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Togut (Analysts)】\nCould you gauge net price increases that you're realizing, both in the payroll services and human resources services business this year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes, a little bit different on HRS. And we typically don't get real specific about how much we take. That's a little bit different typically from payroll services -- some day -- some years, I should say. We don't increase certain product lines. But I would say on payroll services, we're solidly within the 2% to 4% guideline and don't appear to be having any probably holding that -- those price increases.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Togut (Analysts)】\nGot it. And could you ballpark for us what the bookings growth was in the quarter?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nNo, we won't do that. It was strong. We feel pretty good about it. I'd just say this, David, not to be too coy, because I got that question all the time. What really matters is how we did in the selling season. And so much of -- you can have a good quarter and we've had good quarters in the past, first and second, and not had a good selling season in third quarter. So we feel pretty encouraged about where we started the year. We think it bodes well for selling season. But we're not in selling season yet and we'll update when we get there.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes, I think that's right, Efrain. Very consistently, we feel very good about it as we did at the end of the year and didn't have any bumps, getting off to a good start. But as Efrain said, the selling season makes the difference for us.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Smittipon Srethapramote (Analysts)】\nFirst question's on the PEO space. One of your competitors has recently seen higher medical claims cost. And even though you guys haven't experienced this, given you're exposed to different states, can you talk about whether or not that's impacted your view on taking insurance risk?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes, good question. So we saw the same. We saw the same things that have been seen in the market -- or we saw the results, I should say. Our experience is very different. We employ teams of actuaries and set our premiums -- premium expense very, very conservatively. So there's no guarantee. You can have a hiccup, but we do a lot to minimize it. We also have a pretty low -- we have pretty conservative ceilings for reinsurance. And I think, all of that is great. But I think the most critical part of the entire equation is what you do from an underwriting standpoint when a client is presented to you. One of the things that we did -- this was before I got here [ph], and one of the things that Marty instituted was a very clear line between the authority that underwriters have and sales have. While they operate cooperatively, we task our underwriters with protecting the quality of the pool, and that has served us very well. So there is inherent risk in that area, but I think we manage it very well. When we looked at what others were doing and how they had structured their approach to risk, it was a bit different from what we do.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Smittipon Srethapramote (Analysts)】\nOkay, and maybe continuing on the PEO side, can you provide more details on the growth rate of your worksite employee count and whether that's still in the 20s?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes, we won't update the worksite employee account -- count to give you specific numbers. We'll eventually release all of that information. But I would say it is fair to say that part of the reason why Q1 results were strong was that PEO was an element of strength in the quarter. So we continue to do very well in that area.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jason Kupferberg (Analysts)】\nWanted to just pick up on the PEO topic as well here to start. The momentum that you're seeing there, I mean, to what extent do you think it's coming from share gains versus the general rising tide lifting a lot of boats just given the catalyst of the Affordable Care Act?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nI think, obviously, a lot of it is coming from the Affordable Care Act. I think there's just a lot of interest in the market. But I think at the same time, because we're kind of a proven leader in this space and I have a very good sales team on this. I think we're picking up more share of what's now becoming a PEO sale. So I would say it's, Jason, it's a bit of both because there's such an interest now, particularly as it's getting closer and closer for the -- to respond to the Affordable Care Act from a PEO standpoint, frankly, and an insurance standpoint. And because of our positioning of our product and our success, we're picking up more share.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jason Kupferberg (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then just switching gears over to Flex Hiring. If we try and just get a bead on sort of magnitude of contribution, obviously, it's an important offering. Is there material revenue baked into this year's guidance for it? Or should we think of it as more of a potentially material contributor in fiscal '17?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nI'd say, yes, probably more of a contributor in '17 because it's going to take a while to build up, but it's adding a lot of strength to the packages that we're providing. It's -- not only is it giving them full recruiting and hiring, but we're selling -- we sell onboarding as even a separate offering, which is a paperless onboarding that doesn't have to be a mid-market sale. It can be a 20 person of it hires a lot and it's all paperless from an onboarding perspective. So I'd say this year, it's kind of getting started and you'll see a start to it. But the bigger magnitude of it will come in future years and starting in '17.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jason Kupferberg (Analysts)】\nAnd just last one for me. I wanted to catch up on the M&A pipeline because it felt for a period of time like you guys had sort of opened the aperture a little bit in terms of opportunities you were willing to consider. Obviously, staying disciplined in evaluating those opportunities, but would you say there's been any directional move in the pipeline in terms of it being closer to bearing fruit versus not in recent months?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes, I'd say so. Although, you never know until you get to the finish line. But we certainly have been very active in a number of fronts on it. And -- but as you said, we're still very being disciplined. So we have a pretty wide funnel at the beginning. We bring it down pretty tightly to where we think it's a reasonable valuation, whether it's going to add a lot of value to us. And -- but we've got to -- there's a few things in the hopper now that we're evaluating. Do they get over the finish line? You never know until we're ready to announce. But we're very active in it. That's for sure.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kartik Mehta (Analysts)】\nMarty, I wanted to ask you about the Paychex Flex and the percentage of customers that have converted to that particular version of payroll processing.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nIt's hard -- the basic product that we have was Paychex Next Generation. All clients are on Paychex Next Gen. Then Flex adds kind of a -- another full product suite to that. So we're in the process of moving some of the clients over. But there's a number of clients that are already on what I would say is the foundation of it. So a lot of clients are not going to see -- the majority of our clients are not going to see any movement. They're not being moved to anything, unless they drive -- this is more of a mid-market product suite that are going to see more, and they're being offered that. We're still offering the old product suite. What we're saying is, \"Hey, if you want to come over to a fully -- a full suite for human capital management that is fully integrated within a single-employee record, we will move you over.\" So we're kind of in the early stages of that. But it's not a big push to force everybody over. It's more, \"Hey, if you want these additional enhancements, come over,\" and it's really targeted more in that mid-market space. The majority of our clients won't see a move, so there's not going to be any disruption that we expect there at all.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kartik Mehta (Analysts)】\nYes, I guess, again to Marty, is there -- have you seen a -- have you experienced greater sales of products as people have moved over to Flex, especially in the mid-market, considering there'll probably more demand for some of your products?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes, it's early but I think, yes. I mean, that's what they're looking for. And so we're -- that's why we're excited with the Gartner change to put us as a Leader, because that's what they're looking for, is that full suite of products, fully integrated, single-employee record and database. And we are seeing an increased demand there. And I think, if you were to talk to the sales team, particularly in the mid-market, we just left the sales conference of our top performers a few weeks ago and extreme excitement about selling the product and being very competitive in the marketplace. So I think, it's early, but you'll start to see that really pick up and it will add, as we talked about a little bit earlier, much more product per client.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kartik Mehta (Analysts)】\nAnd then, Efrain, just any change in philosophy in how you manage a float portfolio, considering there might be interest rate increases going forward here?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nNot yet, but it's on my list of objectives. So Kartik, what we need to know is when they're going to raise and then what the increase in the -- the rate of increase will be. And I think the Fed's been signaling as directly as I've ever heard them signal when it's going to happen. And I expect that when they signal their -- or when they implement their first increase, they'll give some direction as to what we can expect then in subsequent increases. That will permit you to decide how to position duration of the portfolio. So I'm waiting for all of that information to get a better sense of how we sit down and strategize around the best way to position the portfolio. So that's coming in the -- probably in the second half of the year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Richard Eskelsen (Analysts)】\nThe first question is just -- you said you just came from a sales conference. I was curious what feedback you heard from your salespeople. Any potential changes to client behavior given the financial market weakness and also some of the concerns about the global economy?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes, I think, generally -- and we release a monthly small business index and in fact, I was just in New York City yesterday because we've expanded it now for different industries. We're seeing continued -- particularly in the small business, under 50, we're seeing continued better employment growth than prerecession levels in 2004. And so -- and it's down a little bit from last year, but it's consistently above that level. So we're feeling like a steady improvement in small business formation and employment hiring. And I would say the sales folks certainly felt that way. I think, the bigger excitement at the sales conference was just about the products that we're rolling out and the full feature and the strength of the competitive offering, along with the service options, now 7-by-24 service and a lot of different options that -- more self-service that clients can provide. So they were pretty excited, first, to be there. Obviously, they're top performers; and second, that they got a good year in front of them, they feel.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Richard Eskelsen (Analysts)】\nAnd then on the ESR offering that you have, just wondering if you could sort of give an update on how that's progressing. What percentage of the clients that you think might take it have taken it so far? And does it feel like it's going to be a \"down to the wire\" type of offering where people take it at the very end?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes, sure. I don't -- we don't really release, I don't think, how many are taking it from -- yet at this point. I would say it's very active. And I think it will be active down to the end. We continue to provide it to our clients. I know some competitors have stopped providing it. If there's a lot of work involved, then we're making sure that the clients upfront understand it. There's a lot of information needed from the client for us to do this successfully for them. But I think we're handling it very well. We've increased the resources who are selling it. We've increased the resources who are supporting it, because we're continuing to operate. And I think, this will be -- yes, I think, this will be pretty active right through the end of the year. And I think, then there'll be another surge, probably after, of people who -- clients who realized, \"Hey, I should have had this when it comes time to file and now I need it.\" So I think we'll have kind of another resurgence of sales, probably in kind of the end of the first or second calendar quarter of next year. But it's going very well. It's going very well.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gary Bisbee (Analysts)】\nFirst question. You've talked a lot about the success in selling bundled offerings in recent years. But one thing I don't think we've heard as much commentary on is just how you approach upselling additional components of products into the base? And what the success has been in doing so? Any commentary you can provide on that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes, sure. Because, Gary, one of the points I've tried to make is one of the things we shifted. Typically our model was sell payroll and then the other sales forces with the other products come in kind of after that pretty much on a timetable basis. You get someone comfortable with payroll then you come in and talk to them about their -- the value of a 401(k) record keeping, about the value of HR outsourcing, insurances, et cetera. Now what we found is certain client sizes and complexity of the client, we come into that client with an integrated team selling approach over the last, I'd say, year, 1.5 years now and it's been very successful. So what we found was, we were not selling the full value of what the client was looking for many times in our old approach. And so if we see a client that's a certain number of employees, has a certain hiring pattern, has a certain complexity to their business, we'll go in with multiple sales forces or multiple sales products and sell them all at the same time, and that's been going very well. It's -- I think, once we got the sales teams comfortable with it, they've been more successful and we're getting a nice track record as we get this -- as we get some real momentum going.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nLet me build on that, what Marty said. So that's the team selling approach. On the other side of it, we've done a lot of data analysis, a lot of modeling based on predictive behavior modeling. And we have models that basically predict what your -- the next best offering will be when you don't take a bundle. So that science keeps getting better and better. So we know at certain stages of your life cycle, and based on what products you're doing and the characteristics of -- your client characteristics, your customer characteristics, what offering is likely to be the most successful. So we deploy those models out to the sales force, too. So both of those have -- approaches have helped us become more efficient.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gary Bisbee (Analysts)】\nIs that a telesales, the selling of more stuff to existing customers? Or is it your feet on the street?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nNo, it's -- actually, it's more of the feet on the street. It's -- I mean, I think, we're much more effective on the telesales side as well, but that's been really more for the single product sale or a follow-up sale. But the feet on the street have a been much more on the integrated team selling approach because we have many offices that obviously have multiple sales teams, but they just kind of approach the client at different stages. And now if the client is the right -- looks like the right fit for multiple products, they'll go out and sell as a team, and we're finding some good success in that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gary Bisbee (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then just the 15% HRS growth, obviously, continues to be really good, but is that a clean like-for-like number, or was there a little bit of benefit still from the mix with the minimum premium health plan? Or is that really [indiscernible]\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nNo, there's always going to be a little bit of benefit from MPP, but that wasn't a significant part of what happened. Actually, because you were -- we had the same product mix in the quarter, but MPP really did not dramatically impact that number. It really was strength of PEO, strength of ESR and strength frankly across a lot of other HRS products.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gary Bisbee (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then just the last one, I know you've talked about M&A, but you're going to do things only if you can get the right price and whatnot. How shall we think about just the cash build from here? Are you likely -- I think, you've indicated special dividends didn't seem of real interest. I know you've been doing some buybacks, but a lot less than your cash flow. Should we think that the likely approach is just continuing to build cash until you do find the M&A? Are there any other options that you're [indiscernible]\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes, Gary, I get this question a lot. And what's difficult -- my answer always is the same. What's difficult for the Street to evaluate what we're doing is you don't have insight into the pipeline and the probability of our pulling the trigger on deals. I will say that most -- you can assume that most of the deals that occur in the fintech space of any reasonable size we've looked at. And that for whatever reason, we've decided on a valuation that didn't permit us to get to the finish line because we're pretty disciplined about how we go about it. Having said all of that, the pipeline, as Marty said, is pretty robust. And so we see a number of opportunities that we like and would prefer to simply have the cash to move quickly and deploy it in first instance to the extent that we got to a point where really the pipeline looked -- didn't look as robust, then I think that we'd start looking at other ways to deploy cash to shareholders. But part of the way we do that and part of our confidence in the future is that in the summer, we boosted dividend pretty significantly. And we have been buying back shares. If you look at our share count, vis-à-vis the last quarter, you see our -- the bias is downward, which is something that we started a couple of years. So all 3 of those are elements to how we're looking at cash. But in terms of large cash outlay beyond dividends, we think the pipeline, there's opportunities there, in the space. And we think that, that valuations have come down to a point where there's a number of things -- opportunities that seem reasonable now that maybe weren't reasonable 18 to 24 months ago.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sara Gubins (Analysts)】\nIt sounds like your margins outperformed in the first quarter versus your internal plans. Is that fair? And if yes, could you talk about what drove the upside?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nBoy, Sara, that's a pretty interesting deduction. Yes, they were a little bit stronger than we had anticipated. However, I would say this, so there's 2 elements that always typically in the first quarter, we're trying to peg how quickly we go out of the gate in spending, and so it's typically the case that we're a little bit slower. So some of that is timing, I would say. And then we did well on sales. We feel pretty positive about that. We still don't think it's enough throughout. We're still not confident enough throughout the remainder of the year to call it as an upside to where we are, but we certainly had a strong start to the quarter -- to the year, I should say.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sara Gubins (Analysts)】\nOkay, great. And then switching gears back to health care reform and the ACA product. It sounds like it continues to grow strong and you think that, that could continue for a couple of more quarters? How much of a lift is it to the average revenue per client?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nI don't think we've really -- from a competitive standpoint, we haven't given out all of pricing and so forth, so I'd be careful I guess -- I don't want to say too much, but I would say it's a significant increase. It's a pretty significant -- it's -- I don't know [indiscernible].\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nGood uplift, and you see it in HRS. So.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes, yes. And we're seeing a lot of success with it. I'm not trying to be coy about it, but I just want to be careful how I'm talking about the pricing of it because there's a lot of discussion about pricing of Affordable Care Act and there's a lot of different plans out there right now that people are saying they're doing certain things and I think clients got to look very carefully at pricing and what they're getting for the product that they're buying because some are giving them a lot. Yes, I think we're giving them a very full-valued service and others are kind of giving them a form to fill in. And I think that's what may shake out here toward the end is clients are going to be a little surprised maybe at what they bought and what they didn't buy. But it continues to have really nice momentum for us. Sales are doing well with it. A number of sales teams are selling it. And as Efrain said, you're really seeing it in the HRS revenue uplift.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nBut I -- one thing I'd add to that, Sara, that PEO was strong, ASO was strong, HR outsourcing, in general, was strong too. So what ESR has done is it, it's had a bit of a halo effect on a number of other products. Even when you don't sell the product, it permits you to get in the door to have a conversation. I think there are very few clients that won't entertain a call about what they're doing with respect to ACA compliance because there's so much confusion in the market about it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sara Gubins (Analysts)】\nOkay, great. And then last quarter, you'd said that you're about 1/4 to a 1/3 penetrated for potential clients that might take it. Is that as high now as half? Is it going that rapidly?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nI think that's probably a reasonable range in terms of where we're at here. Where we end up is something that we're just monitoring to see.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes, I think that's fair.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Macdonald (Analysts)】\nJust a couple more on the ACA. So I think you mentioned -- so that's an HRS revenue -- HR revenue, not payroll?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nCorrect, yes, that's reported in HRS.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Macdonald (Analysts)】\nAnd have you recognized much revenue from that or does it get recognized as you kind of bring the clients on board? Or how will that like ramp-up? How should we think about that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes, so what you're seeing now is where we really started building in the back half of last year, so you start to see the benefit of that in this quarter. So you're starting to see the pickup from the number of clients that we signed on and that kind of will wash through as we go through the year and by the time we're at the end of the year, pretty close to having recognized most of it. Most of the increase, I should say.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Macdonald (Analysts)】\nBy year-end? And just on a different part of ACA, with a number of the public exchanges seeing pretty high price increases for their health products and eliminating products, any impact -- can you talk about that impact of that on you guys in this sort of fall-enrollment-type season?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nI think it's got a couple of different impacts. One, we're not seeing an impact as much on the pure insurance sales basis too much yet because I haven't seen all of those increases aren't all out yet. They're -- you'll see them probably all of it by the end of this -- the next couple of weeks, actually, as they roll out. The other thing I would say is that because of the work in the PEO and the MPP plan, we've seen a very competitive low increases there for our products. And I think that's helped us a lot. That's part of the reason we took on a little bit more risk in that because we felt we could manage that very well and it's been very good for us on much -- I'd say much lower increases to our clients under those plans than the national averages certainly that we're seeing, or regional averages. So I think it's going -- it's been a benefit and will continue to be a benefit for us particularly in the PEO side where we have an MPP. And on the health insurance side, I haven't quite seen it yet, but clients aren't going to have a lot of choice there if they don't have -- in most cities, they're going to have carriers. They're all going double-digit increases, unfortunately. So -- but we haven't seen a big impact to slow anything down from an insurance standpoint.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jeffrey Silber (Analysts)】\nKind of an obscure question here. About a month or so ago, the National Labor Relations Board had a ruling that people believe could, in fact, affect the franchise business where unions are going to be able to negotiate with the franchisors. If I remember correctly, you do a lot of work in the franchise area, please correct me if I'm wrong, but if you do, have you heard or seen any impact, potential impact on your business accordingly?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes, sure. We've not seen it yet. I mean, I do think that it's one of those things that's just another negative that's out there that it makes people a little bit slower on maybe hiring or starting up an additional franchise, let's say. If I own a couple of franchises, I might be just a little more cautious on whether I start another one or not based on that ruling. I think a lot of that's still got to shake out. But it's not -- it certainly adds more confusion and concern to those. We don't have a ton of franchise sales. When you look at -- in the scheme of our sales and our client base, but it's certainly increasing because we've done a lot of work in selling the franchise side, but that's been picking up. So I would say don't have an impact yet, but I do think it may generally put a little bit of a damper on whether I open up a second franchise or not.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jeffrey Silber (Analysts)】\nYes, that's helpful. Is your franchise exposure on the payroll side, the HRS side or mixed?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nMixed. Mixed, we sell all products to the franchises.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Stephen Sheldon (Analysts)】\nIt's Stephen Sheldon in for Tim. Most of my questions have been answered, but I just want to ask, as we get a little closer to the key selling season, can you maybe talk generally about where the sales force currently stands? And have you been doing much hiring? How recent hires have been ramping in terms of productivity? Just any color on how you're positioned there would be appreciated.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes, I think we're in good shape going in from -- first of all from just being very -- we've got all the hires in, training is done. I think Mark Bottini and the leadership team did a great job in getting everyone in, kicking off the year really well. We have a sales kickoffs, a lot of training during the first quarter and so forth on new products. I think we're at a great positioning of training, for example. We do an awful lot now of web training and so forth. And from a client -- from a growth of sales, I would say we're up about normal like we normally add to the sales force. We had our adds and we were pretty much right on track. The good news is everybody is in the seats, well-trained and particularly with all the product changes, they're well versed in the product, and we could feel that and the momentum of it at that -- at the sales award conference.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Marcon (Analysts)】\nCould you -- could we drill down just a little bit with regards to just the core payroll, the acceleration we saw this quarter. Did you say that there was like one extra processing period?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes, one extra processing day. Yes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Marcon (Analysts)】\nAnd how much of an impact did that have?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nGood question, Mark. I won't say specifically for the quarter, but we're going to have 2 of them this year, and we think that the impact will be 0.5%. So if you use arithmetic averages, you can figure out what the impact was.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Marcon (Analysts)】\nJust to be specific, the 0.5% is for the total year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nCorrect, yes. Yes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Marcon (Analysts)】\nOkay. And the other quarter, that it will -- we'll see this impact will be?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nA little bit -- is it the fourth quarter?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nFourth.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nThe fourth quarter.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Marcon (Analysts)】\nThe fourth quarter?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Marcon (Analysts)】\nOkay, great. And then you also mentioned that we should be cognizant on the third quarter?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Marcon (Analysts)】\nWhat -- can you remind us?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes, so I called that out. I'd just refer back to my comments in Q4. I called out, at this point, we think that, that quarter will be just -- it's more timing. I won't go into long amount of detail. I'll update in Q2, but that will be the weakest of the quarters. It's mostly about timing of different revenue flows within that quarter. And I called out HRS as potentially being below the range of the full year guidance. I said that in Q4. We'll update in Q2. But we expect Q3 will be, relatively speaking, the weaker of the 4 quarters in the year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Marcon (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then with regards to this -- to the quarter that we just had on the core side, even when we strip out the impact of the processing, they were still doing well. Can you talk about the biggest single driver behind that in terms of -- you certainly saw pricing stick through. You've had good bookings. But what would you say would be the primary driver?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nWell, I think, it's a combination of holding the price and retention. I mean, if you -- when you look at that immediate quarter, sales were obviously, we are very comfortable and positive on sales. But the impact is when you retain the clients and as I mentioned, we continue to be at our best client retention levels. And on top of that, we are holding the price increase in the range that Efrain gave. So it was a good start to the year. That's when you see kind of that, that first quarter, you kind of see what happened with the price and did we have to take more discounting and so forth. And we felt good about holding the price and felt very good about the client retention as well. Good job on the service team.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Marcon (Analysts)】\nDid the retention ramp up at all?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nSo we don't give -- I would say it's very consistent with where we ended the year which was a record high.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nThe other thing, Mark, that I'd call out is we didn't say anything about checks per client. Obviously, there's a lot of other things to talk about that were positives. But checks per client were flat to down in the quarter. And so when you compare one quarter over another, we still were seeing positive results in checks per client through much of last year. We didn't see that benefit. That's a mix issue that I've called out in the past. So we feel pretty good about where we were from a payroll service revenue standpoint.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Marcon (Analysts)】\nAbsolutely. And then with regards to just the client segments that you're seeing the strongest growth from. Is it -- would it typically be in the 6 employee to 11, or maybe a little bit slightly higher?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nI'd say it's across the board. It's not like the quarter that we're seeing any one segment pick up better. That's -- the good news to us is we're doing well in the -- let's say our typical under-20 segment. And we're also doing well and better, I think, even because of the product and the service options in the mid-market. So I'd say it's across the board.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Marcon (Analysts)】\nAnd exclusive of that kind of the really small 1 to 4 where SurePayroll plays?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nNo, that's included in the mid-market.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes, that's included.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nSo it's both.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Marcon (Analysts)】\nAnd congrats on the upper quadrant. That's relatively early. Any sense for the ability of the sales force to leverage the improved recognition?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nI think we're just -- yes, it's pretty recent. But we'll certainly find any way we can. They're certainly very excited about it because it's always exciting to see a third party, particularly like Gartner puts you in that leadership position and that it's based on our clients being surveyed and our clients saying, \"Hey, this is a great product and a great service.\" And then Gartner coming out of it saying, \"Hey, not only is it good now, but you're a leader because you are positioned well for the future.\" So I will definitely be looking to capitalize on it. And knowing the sales team, they're well trained and well versed. And the things that are happening with Paychex, they'll be able to capitalize on it well.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nAnd the other thing, Mark, I'd add to that is that Marty's strategy really started 7 years ago about investing in IT. And I just want to reiterate 2 things. One is that, this is part of the strategy of how we move Paychex from where we were pre-recession to where we are right now. And I think, it's been a long time in the making, number one. And second, I think that external validation is a lot better and more powerful than simply trumpeting what you think -- what you believe about yourself. So I would say there's a lot of smack talk by competition about how good they are. We don't talk that way except right now. And we prefer to let third parties validate how good we are and let our customers validate how we good we are. We could not have had that honor unless our customers thought very highly about what we do. That's the second point. And then the third point is that a lot of our spending -- now our increases in spending have been around IT. And it helped us from the standpoint of being able to go and may build a credible case that we were entitled to a certain treatment of the expenses we were making based on the strategy that we employed. So I think, it validates a lot of different things that the management team has put in place.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Lisa Ellis (Analysts)】\nQuick question on the team-selling approach. As you've implemented that over the last year, 1.5 years, can you dimensionalize sort of the range, the upside you are seeing in revenue per client when you're able to sell in the fuller suite of services?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nI think, it's pretty significant when you sell it upfront. It's also a timing thing, remember, because I would assume that we're -- normally, we're selling those other products but a little bit further down the road. But we're finding, one, we're selling more of it upfront. Two, I think, by offering the total package, we're selling more of it because were hitting the client at a time that they see the full value more than just selling them payroll then coming back later. I don't know if we'd give the exact percentage or anything, but it's certainly double-digit increase in a -- over the kind of the revenue per client that we would normally see upfront. We just want to get more of that over time, but then I do think we're having more success. We may have -- we thought we may have been missing some opportunities, actually, by selling kind of a payroll only and then coming back later when the client upfront may have felt better particularly today in saying, \"Gee, I really wanted HR outsourcing altogether. I wanted a PEO or an ASO offering. And that's what I really needed. I need it.\" And that's what we're finding because that's come down a lot in employee size, and so it fit the team selling very, very well.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Lisa Ellis (Analysts)】\nTerrific. Good. And then just one quick follow-up on retention. You -- I think you said that -- I just want to confirm, you said retention is kind of holding relatively stable?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes, that's right.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Tien-Tsin Huang (Analysts)】\nJust on the HRS side, I heard there was a little bit better with PEO. The moderation comment for the rest of the year? Is there anything specific there that we should be aware of? Or is it just the previous comments on conservatism?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nWell, first of all, there is some conservatism, so we'll come back in Q2 and update. But the other thing, Tien-tsin, is we had really strong -- we had really strong HRS growth in the back half of the year led by PEO. And when it start anniversary-ing some tougher compares and there's some revenue shifts going on within quarter particularly in Q3. So we want to get a little bit more of a sense of how the year is building before we do anything to guidance.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Tien-Tsin Huang (Analysts)】\nOkay, just wanted to make sure. And then just on the -- just one more, just on the back to minimum premium concept here. I know it's still on the earlier side for you, but have you given any sense of what the mix now is of minimum premium versus the fully insured plans in terms of what you're selling, what's taking, what's not?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nIt's still less than 50% of what we sell in the PEO. And remember the reason why I say that is, that it's only in the state of Florida. So we have PEO business in Texas and California and a number of other important states. So -- and for the -- at least for the near future, that's where it will remain. But Marty mentioned earlier, and I think it was in response to a question about what's happening with health care premium increases, we're very, very competitively positioned. So we'll see and monitor how we do throughout the remainder of the year. We feel really good about both our underwriting standards and also what we've been able to do with that plan. So that could change as time goes on.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Grossman (Analysts)】\nI was just hoping to follow up on a question I think that's been asked in several different ways over the course of the call, and that's really getting to this whole concept of unit versus revenue per client growth. And how we should think about how that's evolving? And I think you've given us several kind of data points on what's driving revenue per client, but fewer details on exactly how to think about that specifically in terms of percentages because -- and how to think about your model longer term in terms of how that could impact the growth rate. So perhaps -- I know that's a long-winded question, but perhaps you could give us some more information or insight into how that should evolve and impact the growth rate.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes, I think, first of all, it's still very balanced. It's -- we're going after both. So -- and I think we've been, obviously, I think we probably went on the side of much more revenue per client growth the last few years as we added additional product. And so that makes the sales team very successful, and we all -- and we did well on raising the revenue per client -- excuse me, but that's because we had so much more product and product bundles and we're very successful with that. That kind of a shifted us back to, hey, how do you balance that? And so I think what you're finding is the sales team much more focused on compensation plans, et cetera, in training on both. Hey, we want to increase the units. I mean, we've talked about where we wanted to be in unit growth in the past, in net client growth. And we're continuing to push to get there, and we've seen very consistent -- consistency through the first quarter. We're trying to continue to balance both of those. We're feeling really good about the revenue per unit, continuing to increase because of the fuller product set in the offerings that we have and the success in selling it. And then -- and retaining it, by the way. And then the unit piece is we're finding other ways to do that, not only with the sales on the street, but from a more of a digital marketing and web-based product or web-based service, so more people coming in that way, buying more payroll only kind of thing and doing that with telesales. So I just want to make sure it's clear. Hey, we're looking to balance both. I think we're going to have success in both, but I would say the revenue per unit is what's been stronger the last couple of years. And that seems to continue. Efrain, anything you want to add it?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nThat's right.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Grossman (Analysts)】\nAnd so is the -- should we think of the unit growth being driven more, if you will, on the smaller client size who are perhaps using one product like payroll or is that an oversimplification?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nI think that's oversimplification. I think we're pushing -- like I would just -- well, I would say that's typically, obviously, where we see most of the growth because 80% of the clients are still under 20. And half our sales come from brand-new businesses so that certainly is fair to say. But I would say we're feeling much better about the mid-market strength given the product suite, the human capital management full suite of products. So I think units are going to come from there as well. It's a little bit -- it's obviously a little bit longer sales cycle and so forth. So I would -- I think it's fair to say that -- since half the sales still come pretty much from brand-new businesses that the units are going to come from. At least half of them are coming from a smaller payroll only, generally, but I think you're going to continue to see the growth of the mid-market better than it has in the last few years because of the product suite.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Grossman (Analysts)】\nRight. And then just one other follow-up question. It's again related to a question that's been asked several times. It's about the Affordable Care Act and how it's impacting the overall business. Can you guys give us a sense, I think, you said, Marty, that you saw a surge and then you're seeing -- you are expecting once you get into calendar '16, people may recognize they didn't do enough if I understood your comments correctly. Is that the way to think about it in terms of just very simple algebra in terms of the timing of when it could affect your business differently than it has in the last several quarters?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes, I think so. I think, as Efrain said, I think as the sales come in now and they're -- I think for at this stage, they'll peak probably in November, October, November, the sales will, then you'll start to get the full revenue of that on a monthly basis right after that. And then clients, I think, clients will see because we talked about kind of the percentage that are taking it of the ones we think it applies to. I think clients will see in the March, April, probably the May time frame because the filings are in March. They'll start to see, \"Gee, I should have done more or it did apply to me and I didn't think so or I just didn't take the time to address it.\" I think sales will pick back up then. I'm not sure that will have a big impact in Q4 for us because it will be a little bit late in that process because I do think sales will pick back up in April and May for those who didn't take it. That's my guess at this point based on what we're seeing. Because some clients are just -- some are great. They're all over it. They're taking it. Others are waiting -- kind of late in the game, but I think we'll see that. Then I think you're going to see a number of them that say, \"I still don't get it. I'm not going to do anything until I have to.\" And then they're going to have to react in April.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Grossman (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then just one last question, just on the impact of potentially higher rates, Efrain. So it would appear at least in this fiscal year, given higher position, it would have a nominal impact. And then we would just factor in like you're going to stay short on the curve at least for the time being, or perhaps should we think about this a little bit differently if we do get an increase in rates over the next 6 months?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes, David, I think you're right. Until I get a better sense of how that develops, it's really tough to figure out what the duration is whether we should barbell the duration, whether -- what the best value on the curve is. I mean, you can do a lot of modeling. We've looked at it, looking at forward rates so it doesn't really give you a sense of what's the best strategy to employ. So as soon as we get a sense of when they're going to raise and get better insight because I think the Fed should tell us then what the pace of change is going to be, then I think we can figure out what makes most sense in terms of configuring the portfolio.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Philip Stiller (Analysts)】\nJust wanted to ask about M&A further on that topic. So maybe you guys talked about the pipeline being busy. Perhaps maybe give us a little more color in terms of what types of opportunities you're considering, whether it's market expansionary, new products. And then also perhaps some commentary on size might be helpful in terms of how big the targets you're considering are.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nI think from a -- I'll start the answer with the size standpoint. It's been anything from small to pretty large. I mean, that hasn't concerned us too much at all. The second thing is not as much about product now, adding product, because I think we've really done that with all the acquisitions we've done over the last few years. And frankly, that's what's exciting now is when you see recruiting -- we don't even mention this, but when you see recruiting and onboarding, roll into the Flex product suite, that's myStaffingPro, one of the best recruiting packages in the industry that we acquired a few years ago and now have built into our package, an integrated single database kind of thing. So I think we're pretty solid on product. It might be something there, but we're very solid on the full suite of products. And now it's expanding into other things that, I guess, either adding more client base so whether that's payroll companies, PEOs, et cetera, it's adding more and maybe a little bit of an offshoot of that, but not too far. So it goes small to large. It's not as much product as it is, I think, expanding our market share, and maybe going off a little bit different than what we are, but not too much.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes, and just to build on what Marty said. So we typically have done smaller tuck-ins. Our largest acquisition, certainly, in the past 5 years was Sure and that was a little bit over $100 million. So when we say large, we're not talking about transformational opportunities. We're certainly looking at opportunities that are in the hundreds of millions of dollars, but not transformational. And there's a wide range of assets on the market that are of interest to us that are -- fall within that range.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Philip Stiller (Analysts)】\nWould you guys consider taking on debt to fund an acquisition? Or is that off the table?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nWe've addressed that. The answer is if it was the right opportunity, we would consider it. So that's not off the table. We haven't seen too many of those. There've been some that were of interest to us. But again, one of the things that investors should expect when they invest in Paychex is we're not going to grow, buy things to grow the company in that way. We think we have a pretty solid business model with good organic growth characteristics and we think there are some assets out there that are of value that can help. But our strategy isn't to grow by acquisition, our strategy is to buy things and grow them.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nAny more questions?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nAll right. Thank you. At this point, we'll close the call. We're very proud of the team at Paychex and our first quarter results. If you're interested in replaying the webcast of this conference call, it will be archived until October 30. And just a reminder, our Annual Meeting of Stockholders will be held October 14, at 10:00 a.m. here in Rochester. That meeting will also be broadcast over the Internet. Thank you again for taking the time to participate in our first quarter press release conference call and for your interest in Paychex. Have a great day.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you, Kayla. Good morning to everyone. Last night, we reported operating results for the 16-week fourth quarter and 52-week fiscal year that ended August 30. These results are compared to the similar 16- and 52-week periods of fiscal '14, which ended last year on August 31. \r\nPlease note that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements address risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reported and filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake to update these statements except as required by law.\r\nTo begin with, our fourth quarter fiscal '15 operating results. Net sales for the fourth quarter came in at $35 billion, up 1% overall a year ago. Comp sales were down 1% on a reported basis, but were up 6% including the negative gas and FX impacts. Gas prices for the quarter were down 21% year-over-year, negatively impacting U.S. comp figures by a little more than 3 percentage points, so a plus 6% U.S. comp excluding gas price deflation.\r\nForeign currencies, overall, were weaker relative to the dollar year-over-year in the fourth quarter such that our reported international comps on a reported basis are minus 10% in Canada and a minus 7% international -- in Other International. Assuming flat year-over-year FX rates and excluding gas price deflation would have been plus 7% in Canada and plus 6% elsewhere internationally. For the quarter, earnings per share came in at $1.73, up $0.15 or 10% from last year's $1.58 figure. \r\nIn terms of a year-over-year EPS comparison, a few items of note, and the biggest item of note, FX. In Q4 year-over-year, the foreign currencies where we operate were weaker versus the U.S. dollar, resulting in our reported foreign earnings this year in Q4 being lower by about $53 million after tax or $0.12 a share than these earnings would have been had FX exchange rates been flat year-over-year. \r\nNumber two, income taxes. Our income taxes this year in Q4 included several discrete items that, in the aggregate, decreased our income tax line by $23 million or about $0.05 a share. The largest component of the $23 million figure was a $17 million or almost $0.04 a share income tax benefit that resulted from our decision to repatriate in the near future from Canada back to the U.S. CAD 750 million or about USD 560 million of cash balances.\r\nThird item of note, IT modernization. As discussed in the past several quarters, our major IT modernization efforts are ongoing and will continue to negatively impact our SG&A expense percentages through the next fiscal year and possibly beyond, especially as new major systems were placed into service and depreciation begins. In the fourth quarter, on an incremental year-over-year basis, these costs impacted SG&A by an estimated $22 million or 6 basis points, 4 basis points without deflation and FX or about $0.03 a share.\r\nAnd lastly, LIFO. Last year in the fourth quarter, we recorded a pretax LIFO charge of $11 million pretax or $0.02 a share. This year, we actually had a LIFO credit bring back $14 million pretax or $0.02 a share. A lot of that had to do with gas deflation.\r\nIn terms of new openings. For all of fiscal '15, we opened 25 new locations, which included 2 relos, so a net of 23. Twelve new in the U.S., 3 each in Mexico and Japan and 1 each in Canada, U.K., Taiwan, Korea and Australia, which, therefore, ended fiscal 2015 a few weeks back with 23 net new warehouses and a total of 686 locations operating worldwide. For the current fiscal year '16, our plans are to add up to 32 net new warehouses, including a few business centers in the U.S. 18 to 20 of the planned new locations will be in the United States with the remaining in international markets, including our second opening in Spain and our first opening planned for France.\r\nDuring the first 4 months of '16 through calendar year end, we plan to open 13 of those up to 32 warehouses including 2 relos, so net of 11 and 9 in the U.S., 1 each in Canada, Australia, Japan and Spain and then the 2 U.S. relos are net 11 figure -- in the 9 figure, sorry.\r\nAlso this morning, I'll review with you our membership trends and related activities, our e-commerce activities, plenty of discussion of margins in SG&A and recent stock repurchase activities. \r\nOkay, so for our fourth quarter results. Sales, again, for the fourth quarter, the 16 weeks ended August 30, were $35 billion, up 1% from last year's $34.8 billion. On a reported basis, again, comps were down minus 1%. For the quarter, this minus 1% reported comp figure was a combination of an average transaction decrease of about 4.5% for the quarter. And again, this included the detriment from FX of a little over 4% and gasoline price deflation of a little over 2.5% impact. So as you can see, excluding the -- these negative factors, comps overall were up 6%. And the transaction, actually, on an ex gas and FX, would have been slightly positive and an average frequency increase of just under 4%, about 3.75%.\r\nIn terms of sales by geographic region. Most U.S. regions registered low single-digit comp increases. Again, that -- these numbers include the impact of gas deflation of a little over 3% in the U.S. with the Midwest, Texas and California being the strongest. Internationally in local currencies, the strongest results were Australia and Mexico, Taiwan and Spain, recognizing Spain only has 1 new unit. \r\nIn terms of comp sales by merchandise categories for the quarter. For food and sundries, comps were mostly flat for the quarter. Again, all these items -- all these figures include about a 4% detriment from FX. The better performing departments were deli, sundries and candy. Within hardlines, in the low single-digit range, better performing departments were sporting goods, hardware and automotive. Consumer electronics were a negative low single-digit year-over-year, positive low single-digit ex FX. For softlines, comps were in the low single-digit range. Better performing departments included home furnishings and domestics. And within fresh foods, comps were in the low single-digit range as well, with the best results in deli, produce and meat.\r\nMoving on down the income statement to membership fees. On a reported basis, membership fees came in at $785 million or 2.24% of sales. That's up $17 million or 2% in dollars and up 3 basis points. Again, FX has a big impact on these dollar figures. Assuming flat year-over-year FX, the 2% dollar increase would have been up 6%. In terms of membership, we continue to enjoy strong renewal rates, 91% in the U.S. and Canada and 88% worldwide and a strong -- also, we're enjoying strong sign-ups, both on new and existing warehouses, and continuous strength in our Executive Member program. In terms of members at fiscal year end, we had 34.0 million Gold Star members, up from the most recent quarter of 33.2 million. Primary business is 7.1 million, up from 7.0 million. We continue to have business add-on members of 3.5 million. So all told, member households, 44.6 million at fiscal year end, which is up from 43.7 million 16 weeks earlier.\r\nIncluding additional cards, total cardholders out there stood at 81.3 million at fiscal year end, up from 79.6 million a fiscal quarter ago.\r\nAt fiscal year end, Executive Memberships were 16.1 million, which is an increase of about 400,000 members since Q3 end, so about 25,000 a week increase in the quarter. In terms of membership renewal rates, as I mentioned, they continued strong. Total came in rounds up to a 91 and -- for U.S. and Canada and total worldwide rounds up to an 88. \r\nGetting back to the income statement. Our gross margin in the fourth quarter on a reported basis was higher year-over-year by 44 basis points, coming into 11.4% this year versus a year ago fourth quarter at 10.70%. And without the impact of gas price deflation, that increase would be up 15 basis points.\r\nNow as you jot down just 2 columns of numbers, looking just the fourth quarter here, column 1 would be reported basis and column 2 would be without gas deflation.\r\nFirst line item would be core merchandise. On a reported basis year-over-year, up 17 basis points; ex gas deflation, down 8 basis points. Ancillary businesses reported, plus 25. Without gas, plus 18. \r\nThe 2% Reward. Increasing sales penetration related to Executive Member sales of the 2% Reward, minus 5 reported and minus 2 ex gas. LIFO plus 7 and a plus 7. In total, the reported basis, as I mentioned, plus 44 basis points and ex gas plus 15. \r\nNow reviewing these figures. Again, the core merchandise component was up 17 but minus 8 without gas, primarily a function of improved year-over-year gross margins within our gasoline and several other ancillary warehouse businesses. \r\nThe core merchandise gross margin, which I define as the main 4 departments -- merchandise departments: food and sundries, hardlines, softlines and fresh foods, as a percentage of their own sales, were actually up 13 basis points year-over-year. Food and sundries, hardlines and softlines were up year-over-year while fresh foods was a little lower.\r\nAncillary and other business gross margins were up, as I mentioned, in the chart there, up 25 basis points plus 18 without gas. We enjoyed broad-based strength across most of our ancillary businesses with the year-over-year gross margin improvements in gas, optical, hearing aids, as well as solid operating results in e-commerce, business centers, travel and Executive Member services.\r\nIn LIFO, in the fourth quarter, as I mentioned, it was about 4 -- year-over-year was a 4 basis point benefit or $14 million compared to a 3 basis point detriment a year ago of $11 million.\r\nOur year-end inventory shrink results were in line with our all-time best results, and our inventory positions were in great shape. All in all, gross margins inventories are in good shape.\r\nMoving on to SG&A. Our SG&A percentages year-over-year in the fourth quarter were higher or worse by 27 basis points, coming in at -- right at 10.00% of sales this year compared to 9.73% last year. Again, taking out gas deflation, essentially flat year-over-year, higher or worse by 1 basis point.\r\nAgain, I'll ask you to jot down the 2 columns: Q4 reported and Q4 ex gas. Deflation in terms of operations, reported minus 15 or higher by 15 basis points; without gas deflation, plus 8 basis points or lower or better by 8. Central, a minus 7 and a minus 5. Stock compensation, a minus 5 and a minus 4. All told, we came in on a reported basis higher by 27 basis points on SG&A, and again, ex gas deflation, minus 1 basis point. \r\nAnd looking at these figures, the operations component of SG&A was higher again or worse by 15, and again, excluding gas, lower or better by 8. Within operations, ex gas deflation, core warehouse payroll and other operating expenses were better by 10 basis points and about half of which was improvement in payroll percent.\r\nCentral expense was higher or worse by 7 basis points year-over-year, 5 without gas, with nearly all of that variance coming from our IT modernization efforts, 6 and 5 basis points, respectively, with or without gas deflation.\r\nLastly, stock compensation expense, represented, again, a minus 5, minus 4 without gas. Just we have over 4,000 people in our plan and that's done well as a compensation tool.\r\nNext on income statement is preopening, higher by $12 million, coming in at $27 million this year versus $15 million a year ago. Last year, in the quarter -- in the fourth quarter, we had 10 openings. This year, we had 13. Of the $12 million year-over-year incremental expense, which is about $0.02 a share, a little under half of it is due to incremental units, 13 versus 10. The rest, about $7 million of variance, is simply increase in preopening expense associated with upcoming openings in the first several months of our new fiscal year versus the similar period a year earlier.\r\nAll told, reported operating income in the quarter increased $65 million or 6% year-over-year to $1.156 billion this year.\r\nBelow the operating income line, reported interest expense was higher year-over-year, coming in at $40 million this year, from -- up from $35 million a year ago. This is mostly due to the interest expense on the $1 billion debt offering that was completed earlier this calendar year to fund a portion of the special dividend.\r\nInterest income and other was higher or better year-over-year by $10 million, coming in at $40 million this year in the fourth quarter versus $30 million a year ago. Actual interest income for the quarter came in at $12 million compared to $17 million a year ago, so actually lower by $5 million. The other component of interest income and other was higher or better by $15 million, primarily related to various FX-related items, a lot with the foreign countries when they're locking in some of their FX needs.\r\nOverall, pretax income was up 6% or $70 million this year versus last year. In terms of our tax rate, our company tax rate for the quarter came in lower than last year at 32.7% this year versus 35.1% last year in the quarter. Again, we benefited from several discrete items in Q4, as I explained -- discussed earlier in the call, such that overall net income was up 10% or $70 million, coming in at $767 million this year in the fourth quarter versus last year's fourth quarter net earnings of $697 million.\r\nFor a quick rundown of other items. While the balance sheet is included in this morning's press release, a couple of quick balance sheet info items. \r\nDepreciation and amortization for the fourth quarter came in at $351 million and for the year $1,127,000,000. Our accounts payable as a percent of inventories on a reported basis was essentially 100%, 101% both at last year and in this year fiscal year end. Ex non-merchandise payables, mostly construction-related, both last year fourth quarter and this year fourth quarter came in at 89%.\r\nIn terms of inventory per warehouse, average inventory per warehouse was up $200,000 or 2% to $13 million at Q4 this year, up from 12.8%. That's -- the actual number, again, assuming FX was flat year-over-year; would have been $535,000 or up about 4.2%. The increase is pretty much spread across many departments and there were no surprises there. Overall, our inventories are in good shape, as I mentioned earlier.\r\nIn terms of CapEx, in the fourth quarter, we spent $805 million. And for all of '15, capital expenditures totaled $2.4 billion. Our estimate for fiscal '16 CapEx is an increase from that $2.4 billion level, somewhere in the high 2s, somewhere between $2.8 billion and $3 billion range. This year-over-year increase in CapEx represents our plans for more openings this year versus last year, increased spending for remodeling and expanding ancillary business operations, planned expansion of our cross-docking distribution operations and expenditures related to our ongoing IT spending for our modernization efforts.\r\nIn terms of Costco Online. We're still operating Costco Online in 4 countries: U.S., Canada, U.K. and Mexico. For the fiscal year, total e-commerce sales came in just under $3.5 billion, up a little over 20% for the year. Comp sales and e-commerce, again, overall, so up 20% for both the fourth quarter and the fiscal year.\r\nIn terms of expansion, I talked earlier about up to 32 units. Net of relos, we'd expect 11 in Q1, 3 in Q2, 7 in Q3 and 11 in Q4. Q4 being a little longer fiscal period, 16 weeks versus 12 weeks in the others. In fiscal '15, I mentioned on a net basis, we added 23 units on a base of 653, so about 3.5% square footage growth. This year, assuming a 32 units on a base of 686, that would be just under 5% square footage growth. In terms of new locations by country, assuming that 30, 32 figure: about 18 in the U.S., Canada up 3, 2 each in Japan and Australia, and 1 each in the U.K., Taiwan, Korea, Mexico, Spain and France. As of fourth quarter end, total square footage stood at 98.7 million square feet. \r\nIn terms of common stock repurchases, buybacks. For the fourth quarter, we spent $260 million on 1.836 million shares at an average price of just under $142. On an annualized basis, that would be about $850 million as an annualized run rate during the quarter. For the year, we spent $494 million at an average price of $142.87.\r\nIn terms of dividends, our third quarterly dividend stands at $0.40 a share or $1.60 a share annualized. That was up 12.5% from the prior quarterly rate and paid in the first 2 quarters of fiscal '15. This year's $1.60 per share dividend represents an annual cost to the company of about $700 million. And as you know, back in February, we did a special dividend of $5 per share, which was a total of a $2.2 billion special dividend paid out to our shareholders.\r\nLastly, and before I turn it over to Kayla for Q&A, our fiscal '16 first quarter schedule of earnings release date for the 12-week first quarter ending on November 22 will be after market close on Tuesday, December 8, with the earnings call the following morning on the 9th of December.\r\nWith that, I'll open it up for questions and turn it back to Kayla.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nThank you, Kayla. Good morning to everyone. Last night, we reported operating results for the 16-week fourth quarter and 52-week fiscal year that ended August 30. These results are compared to the similar 16- and 52-week periods of fiscal '14, which ended last year on August 31. \r\nPlease note that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements address risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reported and filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake to update these statements except as required by law.\r\nTo begin with, our fourth quarter fiscal '15 operating results. Net sales for the fourth quarter came in at $35 billion, up 1% overall a year ago. Comp sales were down 1% on a reported basis, but were up 6% including the negative gas and FX impacts. Gas prices for the quarter were down 21% year-over-year, negatively impacting U.S. comp figures by a little more than 3 percentage points, so a plus 6% U.S. comp excluding gas price deflation.\r\nForeign currencies, overall, were weaker relative to the dollar year-over-year in the fourth quarter such that our reported international comps on a reported basis are minus 10% in Canada and a minus 7% international -- in Other International. Assuming flat year-over-year FX rates and excluding gas price deflation would have been plus 7% in Canada and plus 6% elsewhere internationally. For the quarter, earnings per share came in at $1.73, up $0.15 or 10% from last year's $1.58 figure. \r\nIn terms of a year-over-year EPS comparison, a few items of note, and the biggest item of note, FX. In Q4 year-over-year, the foreign currencies where we operate were weaker versus the U.S. dollar, resulting in our reported foreign earnings this year in Q4 being lower by about $53 million after tax or $0.12 a share than these earnings would have been had FX exchange rates been flat year-over-year. \r\nNumber two, income taxes. Our income taxes this year in Q4 included several discrete items that, in the aggregate, decreased our income tax line by $23 million or about $0.05 a share. The largest component of the $23 million figure was a $17 million or almost $0.04 a share income tax benefit that resulted from our decision to repatriate in the near future from Canada back to the U.S. CAD 750 million or about USD 560 million of cash balances.\r\nThird item of note, IT modernization. As discussed in the past several quarters, our major IT modernization efforts are ongoing and will continue to negatively impact our SG&A expense percentages through the next fiscal year and possibly beyond, especially as new major systems were placed into service and depreciation begins. In the fourth quarter, on an incremental year-over-year basis, these costs impacted SG&A by an estimated $22 million or 6 basis points, 4 basis points without deflation and FX or about $0.03 a share.\r\nAnd lastly, LIFO. Last year in the fourth quarter, we recorded a pretax LIFO charge of $11 million pretax or $0.02 a share. This year, we actually had a LIFO credit bring back $14 million pretax or $0.02 a share. A lot of that had to do with gas deflation.\r\nIn terms of new openings. For all of fiscal '15, we opened 25 new locations, which included 2 relos, so a net of 23. Twelve new in the U.S., 3 each in Mexico and Japan and 1 each in Canada, U.K., Taiwan, Korea and Australia, which, therefore, ended fiscal 2015 a few weeks back with 23 net new warehouses and a total of 686 locations operating worldwide. For the current fiscal year '16, our plans are to add up to 32 net new warehouses, including a few business centers in the U.S. 18 to 20 of the planned new locations will be in the United States with the remaining in international markets, including our second opening in Spain and our first opening planned for France.\r\nDuring the first 4 months of '16 through calendar year end, we plan to open 13 of those up to 32 warehouses including 2 relos, so net of 11 and 9 in the U.S., 1 each in Canada, Australia, Japan and Spain and then the 2 U.S. relos are net 11 figure -- in the 9 figure, sorry.\r\nAlso this morning, I'll review with you our membership trends and related activities, our e-commerce activities, plenty of discussion of margins in SG&A and recent stock repurchase activities. \r\nOkay, so for our fourth quarter results. Sales, again, for the fourth quarter, the 16 weeks ended August 30, were $35 billion, up 1% from last year's $34.8 billion. On a reported basis, again, comps were down minus 1%. For the quarter, this minus 1% reported comp figure was a combination of an average transaction decrease of about 4.5% for the quarter. And again, this included the detriment from FX of a little over 4% and gasoline price deflation of a little over 2.5% impact. So as you can see, excluding the -- these negative factors, comps overall were up 6%. And the transaction, actually, on an ex gas and FX, would have been slightly positive and an average frequency increase of just under 4%, about 3.75%.\r\nIn terms of sales by geographic region. Most U.S. regions registered low single-digit comp increases. Again, that -- these numbers include the impact of gas deflation of a little over 3% in the U.S. with the Midwest, Texas and California being the strongest. Internationally in local currencies, the strongest results were Australia and Mexico, Taiwan and Spain, recognizing Spain only has 1 new unit. \r\nIn terms of comp sales by merchandise categories for the quarter. For food and sundries, comps were mostly flat for the quarter. Again, all these items -- all these figures include about a 4% detriment from FX. The better performing departments were deli, sundries and candy. Within hardlines, in the low single-digit range, better performing departments were sporting goods, hardware and automotive. Consumer electronics were a negative low single-digit year-over-year, positive low single-digit ex FX. For softlines, comps were in the low single-digit range. Better performing departments included home furnishings and domestics. And within fresh foods, comps were in the low single-digit range as well, with the best results in deli, produce and meat.\r\nMoving on down the income statement to membership fees. On a reported basis, membership fees came in at $785 million or 2.24% of sales. That's up $17 million or 2% in dollars and up 3 basis points. Again, FX has a big impact on these dollar figures. Assuming flat year-over-year FX, the 2% dollar increase would have been up 6%. In terms of membership, we continue to enjoy strong renewal rates, 91% in the U.S. and Canada and 88% worldwide and a strong -- also, we're enjoying strong sign-ups, both on new and existing warehouses, and continuous strength in our Executive Member program. In terms of members at fiscal year end, we had 34.0 million Gold Star members, up from the most recent quarter of 33.2 million. Primary business is 7.1 million, up from 7.0 million. We continue to have business add-on members of 3.5 million. So all told, member households, 44.6 million at fiscal year end, which is up from 43.7 million 16 weeks earlier.\r\nIncluding additional cards, total cardholders out there stood at 81.3 million at fiscal year end, up from 79.6 million a fiscal quarter ago.\r\nAt fiscal year end, Executive Memberships were 16.1 million, which is an increase of about 400,000 members since Q3 end, so about 25,000 a week increase in the quarter. In terms of membership renewal rates, as I mentioned, they continued strong. Total came in rounds up to a 91 and -- for U.S. and Canada and total worldwide rounds up to an 88. \r\nGetting back to the income statement. Our gross margin in the fourth quarter on a reported basis was higher year-over-year by 44 basis points, coming into 11.4% this year versus a year ago fourth quarter at 10.70%. And without the impact of gas price deflation, that increase would be up 15 basis points.\r\nNow as you jot down just 2 columns of numbers, looking just the fourth quarter here, column 1 would be reported basis and column 2 would be without gas deflation.\r\nFirst line item would be core merchandise. On a reported basis year-over-year, up 17 basis points; ex gas deflation, down 8 basis points. Ancillary businesses reported, plus 25. Without gas, plus 18. \r\nThe 2% Reward. Increasing sales penetration related to Executive Member sales of the 2% Reward, minus 5 reported and minus 2 ex gas. LIFO plus 7 and a plus 7. In total, the reported basis, as I mentioned, plus 44 basis points and ex gas plus 15. \r\nNow reviewing these figures. Again, the core merchandise component was up 17 but minus 8 without gas, primarily a function of improved year-over-year gross margins within our gasoline and several other ancillary warehouse businesses. \r\nThe core merchandise gross margin, which I define as the main 4 departments -- merchandise departments: food and sundries, hardlines, softlines and fresh foods, as a percentage of their own sales, were actually up 13 basis points year-over-year. Food and sundries, hardlines and softlines were up year-over-year while fresh foods was a little lower.\r\nAncillary and other business gross margins were up, as I mentioned, in the chart there, up 25 basis points plus 18 without gas. We enjoyed broad-based strength across most of our ancillary businesses with the year-over-year gross margin improvements in gas, optical, hearing aids, as well as solid operating results in e-commerce, business centers, travel and Executive Member services.\r\nIn LIFO, in the fourth quarter, as I mentioned, it was about 4 -- year-over-year was a 4 basis point benefit or $14 million compared to a 3 basis point detriment a year ago of $11 million.\r\nOur year-end inventory shrink results were in line with our all-time best results, and our inventory positions were in great shape. All in all, gross margins inventories are in good shape.\r\nMoving on to SG&A. Our SG&A percentages year-over-year in the fourth quarter were higher or worse by 27 basis points, coming in at -- right at 10.00% of sales this year compared to 9.73% last year. Again, taking out gas deflation, essentially flat year-over-year, higher or worse by 1 basis point.\r\nAgain, I'll ask you to jot down the 2 columns: Q4 reported and Q4 ex gas. Deflation in terms of operations, reported minus 15 or higher by 15 basis points; without gas deflation, plus 8 basis points or lower or better by 8. Central, a minus 7 and a minus 5. Stock compensation, a minus 5 and a minus 4. All told, we came in on a reported basis higher by 27 basis points on SG&A, and again, ex gas deflation, minus 1 basis point. \r\nAnd looking at these figures, the operations component of SG&A was higher again or worse by 15, and again, excluding gas, lower or better by 8. Within operations, ex gas deflation, core warehouse payroll and other operating expenses were better by 10 basis points and about half of which was improvement in payroll percent.\r\nCentral expense was higher or worse by 7 basis points year-over-year, 5 without gas, with nearly all of that variance coming from our IT modernization efforts, 6 and 5 basis points, respectively, with or without gas deflation.\r\nLastly, stock compensation expense, represented, again, a minus 5, minus 4 without gas. Just we have over 4,000 people in our plan and that's done well as a compensation tool.\r\nNext on income statement is preopening, higher by $12 million, coming in at $27 million this year versus $15 million a year ago. Last year, in the quarter -- in the fourth quarter, we had 10 openings. This year, we had 13. Of the $12 million year-over-year incremental expense, which is about $0.02 a share, a little under half of it is due to incremental units, 13 versus 10. The rest, about $7 million of variance, is simply increase in preopening expense associated with upcoming openings in the first several months of our new fiscal year versus the similar period a year earlier.\r\nAll told, reported operating income in the quarter increased $65 million or 6% year-over-year to $1.156 billion this year.\r\nBelow the operating income line, reported interest expense was higher year-over-year, coming in at $40 million this year, from -- up from $35 million a year ago. This is mostly due to the interest expense on the $1 billion debt offering that was completed earlier this calendar year to fund a portion of the special dividend.\r\nInterest income and other was higher or better year-over-year by $10 million, coming in at $40 million this year in the fourth quarter versus $30 million a year ago. Actual interest income for the quarter came in at $12 million compared to $17 million a year ago, so actually lower by $5 million. The other component of interest income and other was higher or better by $15 million, primarily related to various FX-related items, a lot with the foreign countries when they're locking in some of their FX needs.\r\nOverall, pretax income was up 6% or $70 million this year versus last year. In terms of our tax rate, our company tax rate for the quarter came in lower than last year at 32.7% this year versus 35.1% last year in the quarter. Again, we benefited from several discrete items in Q4, as I explained -- discussed earlier in the call, such that overall net income was up 10% or $70 million, coming in at $767 million this year in the fourth quarter versus last year's fourth quarter net earnings of $697 million.\r\nFor a quick rundown of other items. While the balance sheet is included in this morning's press release, a couple of quick balance sheet info items. \r\nDepreciation and amortization for the fourth quarter came in at $351 million and for the year $1,127,000,000. Our accounts payable as a percent of inventories on a reported basis was essentially 100%, 101% both at last year and in this year fiscal year end. Ex non-merchandise payables, mostly construction-related, both last year fourth quarter and this year fourth quarter came in at 89%.\r\nIn terms of inventory per warehouse, average inventory per warehouse was up $200,000 or 2% to $13 million at Q4 this year, up from 12.8%. That's -- the actual number, again, assuming FX was flat year-over-year; would have been $535,000 or up about 4.2%. The increase is pretty much spread across many departments and there were no surprises there. Overall, our inventories are in good shape, as I mentioned earlier.\r\nIn terms of CapEx, in the fourth quarter, we spent $805 million. And for all of '15, capital expenditures totaled $2.4 billion. Our estimate for fiscal '16 CapEx is an increase from that $2.4 billion level, somewhere in the high 2s, somewhere between $2.8 billion and $3 billion range. This year-over-year increase in CapEx represents our plans for more openings this year versus last year, increased spending for remodeling and expanding ancillary business operations, planned expansion of our cross-docking distribution operations and expenditures related to our ongoing IT spending for our modernization efforts.\r\nIn terms of Costco Online. We're still operating Costco Online in 4 countries: U.S., Canada, U.K. and Mexico. For the fiscal year, total e-commerce sales came in just under $3.5 billion, up a little over 20% for the year. Comp sales and e-commerce, again, overall, so up 20% for both the fourth quarter and the fiscal year.\r\nIn terms of expansion, I talked earlier about up to 32 units. Net of relos, we'd expect 11 in Q1, 3 in Q2, 7 in Q3 and 11 in Q4. Q4 being a little longer fiscal period, 16 weeks versus 12 weeks in the others. In fiscal '15, I mentioned on a net basis, we added 23 units on a base of 653, so about 3.5% square footage growth. This year, assuming a 32 units on a base of 686, that would be just under 5% square footage growth. In terms of new locations by country, assuming that 30, 32 figure: about 18 in the U.S., Canada up 3, 2 each in Japan and Australia, and 1 each in the U.K., Taiwan, Korea, Mexico, Spain and France. As of fourth quarter end, total square footage stood at 98.7 million square feet. \r\nIn terms of common stock repurchases, buybacks. For the fourth quarter, we spent $260 million on 1.836 million shares at an average price of just under $142. On an annualized basis, that would be about $850 million as an annualized run rate during the quarter. For the year, we spent $494 million at an average price of $142.87.\r\nIn terms of dividends, our third quarterly dividend stands at $0.40 a share or $1.60 a share annualized. That was up 12.5% from the prior quarterly rate and paid in the first 2 quarters of fiscal '15. This year's $1.60 per share dividend represents an annual cost to the company of about $700 million. And as you know, back in February, we did a special dividend of $5 per share, which was a total of a $2.2 billion special dividend paid out to our shareholders.\r\nLastly, and before I turn it over to Kayla for Q&A, our fiscal '16 first quarter schedule of earnings release date for the 12-week first quarter ending on November 22 will be after market close on Tuesday, December 8, with the earnings call the following morning on the 9th of December.\r\nWith that, I'll open it up for questions and turn it back to Kayla.",
      "transcript_text3": "Just on the core margin performance in the quarter, I think you said was up 13 basis points. Could you delve into the performance by the 4 subcategories? I know you said that food, hardlines and softlines were all up. Just curious, the -- why the pressure on the fresh food side?\n\n---\n\nYes. Well, I think the pressure in the fresh food side is us. We -- when you got some inflation, some of the commodity items like eggs or nuts, you've got -- we're not changing the price of a 16-pack of muffins or a slice of pizza or a hotdog, so it has more to do with that and nothing really surprising there. If you look at each of those 4 categories, again, overall, the gross margin is a percent of sale -- of their own sales, year-over-year in the quarter was up 13. I think the range was in the low 20s on the high side and the mid-teens on that negative downside. So pretty much similar, slightly above last year. No real big changes there.\n\n---\n\nOkay, good. And then when you look to next year, just kind of switching gears a little bit, when you switched to Visa from Amex, can you shape out for us how the switch is going to work and be handled and what you're planning to do with the interchange savings that you're going to generate? And also, just looking back how you handled it in Canada, any surprises on that front?\n\n---\n\nNo. I mean, things in Canada, first of all, went fine. A little different in Canada because of certain Canadian issues. The portfolio was not purchased by the new issuer so we had essentially -- you had people apply for it. That being said, they shop at Costco, they want that co-branded card and they're just fine. You see a little bit of change in renewal rate when that happens because of auto renewals. You've got to re-sign people up and everything, but from an improvement in terms of additional monies, be it for us in terms of lower merchant fees or our members in terms of a better rewards on the co-brand, that's all been as planned. In the U.S., we're working through everything right now. The plan is for -- again, the current contract ends March -- at the end of March next year. That could be in or around 1 month or 2 from there. The 2 parties, Amex and Citi, continue to work towards that end, and we would expect to tell you more when -- where we can. In terms of how it's going to be split between merchant fees and rewards, I think I've stated in the past our philosophy is when we save money on product purchases, we want to get most of it back to the consumer, to the customer. And we're looking at all kinds of opportunities to do that, so stay tuned.\n\n---\n\nOkay, fair enough. And just last question. August comps were obviously pretty good. Just wondering, with September almost closed here, any surprises on September sales for you guys?\n\n---\n\nIf I could tell you, I would. We'll wait until next week.\n\n---\n\nQuick question. I think you telegraphed this on the sales side Labor Day. Realizing it was in September both years, but this year, the quarter may not have caught I guess the lead up to it. I don't know if that's a big deal from a sales or earnings perspective. Just quickly on that.\n\n---\n\nMore of just a sales perspective given you're talking mid-single, low single-digit numbers reported -- normalized and reported. We basically -- in August, it was -- we feel negative impact of about 1 percentage point, and there'll be a corresponding improvement in September reported for the same reason because of the -- but it's 4 weeks versus 5, so it's a little less of a positive, maybe 0.7% or 0.8% if our crystal ball is correct. So yes, the August numbers were impacted negatively a little. The September number will show a little positive in that and we'll point that out in the release.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then the second question on membership fees and the potential increases. Just a question on the thought process, and I think in the past, largely, you've done them to cover inflation. I'm sure there's an inflation over the past 5 years in many areas. So can you talk about considerations and how you think about it? Are you surveying? Are you probing customers understand what's tolerable and then taking into account that the landscape is evolving a little? You have some nontraditional online model and membership models. So how do you think about the right range to raise that?\n\n---\n\nWell, I think we've done 6 $5 increases over roughly 30 years, generally about every 5 or so years. We don't do a lot of polling. We look at it internally if -- have we improved the value of that membership to our member? In terms of the tolerability of it to the member, I know our historical $5, and in the case of the Executive Member last time 5 years ago, a $10 increase is a hell of a lot less than we see in other types of fees out there, be it fees for your television or your phones or other services out there. So I personally don't think it's going to ever be an issue. When is -- we really haven't talked about it a lot. It's something that we'll probably do at some point, but stay tuned.\n\n---\n\nI wanted to just discuss assortment and fulfillment online. Certainly, across the industry, there's been a lot of competition in investments being made in fulfillment, whether it's Amazon or jet.com, or some of the newer initiatives from Sam's Club. Could you just discuss some of your recent one-line sales trends and any updates that you could provide for us on upcoming enhancements around assortment or fulfillment online?\n\n---\n\nI don't there's -- I mean, in terms of -- there are a few things I had mentioned over the last few quarters on a topical basis. We certainly expanded, to some extent, the SKU selection and added what I'd call more frequent -- frequently purchased items, be it food and sundries or a few office needs, everything from, again, sundry items to health and beauty aids, K-Cups, few apparel items. And so we've expanded that. We took certain key departments and brought them in line, so we're not competing with each other and providing, I think, a little more excitement to that. We ship out at more than 1 depot. When we first started this for the first several years in the U.S., everything we shipped out at 1 depot in Southern California, which meant it might take a little longer to get to you and it cost us a little more in terms of delivery or the member. And as we've expanded, we've improved that quite a bit as well. And quite a bit for us. And we're pleased with the fact that sales for the last, gosh, the last 2 or 3 years, at least, have been on year-over-year comp basis around 20%. So we're doing it methodically. We're not going to go crazy out there. I think our mobile apps have improved and will continue to improve, and we like the value proposition we have. We're recognizing that we can't be everything to everybody. That's not what we do for a living, and -- but we have great value. We also like the fact that some of these other services are buying from us. Some our top customers are some of those guys. So if we can't deliver that single unit of milk or cereal to your doorstep, someone, that is, may want to buy from us.\n\n---\n\nGot it. That's helpful. And you spoke about the impact to margins from an IT monetization standpoint. Could you just give us a little more detail about what some of the latest focus points have been in terms of system upgrades and what we should be looking forward to you all tackling over the fiscal '16 period?\n\n---\n\nWell, going back, again, 3-ish years ago, we embarked on a pretty significant effort to really upgrade and modernize our systems. Our systems were, for the most part, legacy systems. Many of them written in-house. Many of them, what I have to say, were band-aided over the years and worked fine but were arguably strained. Some of the systems that were included in there that were not legacy were from outside suppliers that were not going to be supported going forward, or had not been supported. And so we probably started a little later than we should have a few years ago and we had a lot going on. And as I've indicated over the last -- each quarter, frankly, what we try to do is just show you really what the expense associated with those incremental efforts are. We've installed our new membership system a little under a year ago, I think. We installed a new point-of-sale system, which is another deliverable, and few others. A lot of small deliverables that I won't go into. We've got several more over that are heavy into the expense side and should be forthcoming over the next year to 2 years. The other thing I mentioned in terms of we're -- I talked we're extending SG&A. On an incremental basis over the last few years, I think we're now up to something in the low teens, 12, 13 basis points, those 2s, 3s and 5s that have added each year. And recognizing your denominator, your sales, this expense over sales, sales keep increasing. We're seeing all the costs associated with it. I think we'll start to see benefits when we look out beyond '16. It doesn't mean that this SG&A line will not go up a few more basis points. We'll see. But we're -- there's light at the end of the tunnel. It's -- sometimes it's long -- some days, it's a longer tunnel than the others, but we're starting to see some deliverables from it. So there's not a lot I can tell you about where the benefits are. There are clearly some benefits that we're going to see in the transportation side in some of the ancillary businesses like travel and other things, but the big switchover will be when buyers are buying on a new system a year or so down the road and as well as the benefits in transportation and other, but we don't want to put any dollars or basis points in those improvements. We had to do this if we want to double our size over a 10 or so year period, starting a couple of years ago with these expenses because we had a lot of systems that were really strained. And this is going to set us up for the years to come.\n\n---\n\nRegarding a bigger picture question, and I was curious about your thoughts on what really sets you apart from other Internet pure plays in terms of your supply chain and vertical integration and kind of this buying scale and scale you have out there. And then, also, international is a nice piece of the business. Just as we look at our models and talk to this part of the story, which countries do you have the most opportunity to increase your store base versus maximum potential?\n\n---\n\nSure. Well, in terms of e-commerce, I mean, first, we're different because we -- yes, for us, we have a lot more items. We have 8,000 or 10,000 or so instead of 3,700 in store. That's a nit compared to everybody else out there that has hundreds of thousands, if not millions of items. I think what separates us is we've got -- certainly, we and others, will have great quality merchandise. We've got the best pricing overall. We work on margins that are at or slightly below our reported total company margins, but up there in high singles, very low double digits. We'll compare that to anybody out there. Again, we recognize we're not going to be selling single items delivered within 1 hour or 4 hours or overnight necessarily. The -- but in a methodical way, we think we're doing just fine, and we think we'll have additional opportunities. And as I mentioned earlier, we're selling to a lot of these other guys that are wanting to deliver in certain unique ways. There's room for all of us. We've got to keep -- there's a -- it's a big pie out there in terms of market share, and we think that we'll be able to take our share of that. Some little sub-departments, you lose a little. Others, you make a little. Certainly, we want people to still come into our warehouses. In terms of opportunities outside of -- in terms of warehouse club growth opportunities, I think the first comment for those of you on the call who have known us for a long time, the market potential keeps improving. I don't think we ever would have thought, when we had 60 or 70 locations in Canada, we never thought we'd have more than 80. We now have more than that. We will certainly be over 100 at some point in the next several years. In the U.S., we're expanding. If you asked me 5 years ago, when we were 80 U.S., 20 international, I'd say, 5 years hence or now, it's probably 50/50 and going further south in terms of the percentage of openings in the U.S. We keep finding more opportunities here, so that's good news. In terms of other countries, we think we've certainly got a lot of potential in the 3 countries in Asia we're currently at. Bigger market, of course, is Japan, much bigger than Korea and Taiwan, but we think we can go from the low teens in each of Taiwan and Korea, double over the next 10 years, but we'll see, it's one at a time. Australia, we only have 7 units in -- 7 in a country that's, what, 2/3 or a little more than the population of Canada, which has 80 or 90. And I'm not suggesting we're going to have 2/3 of that anytime soon, but we certainly could add a few there. Western Europe, we'll see. It's been tough getting in with all the rules, regulations and permitting process, but we're pretty interested in continuing that process. Again, we'll open our second unit in Spain next month in Madrid in Getafe. Our third unit -- second in the Madrid area next calendar year, and hopefully, our first in France towards the end of the next fiscal year. So we think there's plenty of opportunities. I think we feel comfortable that, over the next 5 years, we'll continue to open 30-ish plus units a year. And then we thought we would do that this year that just ended, up and certainly in the high 20s. And a few of those got delayed, and that's life. But we've got a pipeline that's full. The international, generally, takes a lot longer for a variety of reasons by country. And -- but so we think we'll continue to grow and do just fine in terms of that.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And Richard, just a quick follow-up. There has been talk in terms of competitors in relation to how competitors are dealing with vendors. Could you just update us on your thoughts on your vendor relationships and any catalyst there given your buying scale and your leverage and your heritage? I was just curious on your thoughts.\n\n---\n\nWell, I'd like to think that the comment that we share internally and we talk to you guys about is that we're tough but fair. We are tough. We fight for our member every day, and we -- I'd like to think that we do that as much if not more than anybody else. The good news about us in terms of our view of our competitiveness is we give the vast majority of any improvement back to the member, and that, in our view, creates that moat that hopefully continues to get bigger. We -- one of the challenges and opportunities we have is just the sheer size of our needs of various commodities, organics, nuts, long staple cotton, you name it. And so we've got a lot of efforts in that area that I think many of our competitors don't necessary go to that level because they're dealing with vendors and lots more items. And so I think we have some opportunities and challenges that -- but opportunities and challenges that I think create something special about us. I don't think anything's changed. As we get bigger we can be tougher but still fair, and we work with our vendors. We think we have good relationships with them. I would assume that most of them would agree. Probably a few don't. But we'll continue to be very transparent in how we deal with our vendors. And we have very good relationships with many, many of them.\n\n---\n\nIt's Dan Binder. My question had to do with the ancillary margins. The last 5 quarters, you've had 3 quarters where ancillary margins were up about 15 basis points ex gas deflation and then 2 quarters where they were up substantially more than that. It happens to coincide with the decline in gas prices. And what I'm trying to understand is how much of that gross margin improvement in ancillary is sustainable versus just being a function of the way gas was fluctuating during the quarter?\n\n---\n\nWell, gas for, I think, most of the last 5 fiscal quarters on a year-over-year basis has helped a lot. But other -- the other ancillary business continued to grow, and whether it's optical or hearing aid or some of the other warehouse club businesses, all those things add up, travel, you name it. So I think -- I hope it's sustainable. Clearly, gas, we have no illusion that, at some point in life, gas prices go up and margins will be more normal relative to our history. Right now, it's good for our member in terms of low gas prices and good for us in terms of albeit at a lower top line sales, it's been more profitable on a year-over-year basis.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then the other item I wanted to talk about was other income, which I realize is a function of these FX contracts you talked about earlier in the call. Always a challenge to model. I'm just curious if FX rates were to stay roughly where they are today, how do you think that line item would look in Q1?\n\n---\n\nI don't know. All I can tell you is that we look at it that way, too. I mean, we manage it in the sense that if you got a foreign country where some of their inventory purchases are paid for in dollars or euros sometimes, but use dollars as the bigger example, they will -- once they're comfortable with a price point, that they're going to be able to convert at that level and sell goods in their local currency, in their local country, they're going to choose to figure out how much of that they want to lock in, recognizing locking in just means that they're comfortable with that price. If the local currency continues to weaken, that was good. If the local currency strengthens relative to the U.S. dollar, we shouldn't have done as much. But we don't try to be completely right either way. And so I think over the years, the last 4, 5 years, that's a number that has probably ranged from plus or minus 15 million pretax, usually a little less than the number that we had this period where it's up about 15 or so. But I'd say it's -- we just want to point it out because it's a component of the income statement. It's very hard to predict. I think by doing the way we do it, we're not going to ever have any giant surprise either way because of some drastic change in FX prices.\n\n---\n\nAnd then the last item, the share repurchase picked up a bit this quarter. How are you thinking about it for next -- for this coming year?\n\n---\n\nWell, we'll tell you each quarter end. It's part of our -- what we do with our cash. As long as we feel good about our future, we're not going to ever be -- we're going to buy on a regular basis, not try to take the market. I think the fact that we bought a little more this quarter is the stock shifted down a little bit. But as I've said in the past, we buy a little more when it goes down, and we -- but we certainly -- I certainly feel comfortable about our future prospects as a company. So don't expect giant changes in how we've done it in the past. Certainly, we trended each quarter this year on an annualized basis upward, and we're certainly comfortable with the current level.\n\n---\n\nSo Richard, if you look at the 3 categories or the 3 broad departments where you saw some margin improvement, so 2 things. Was there any common themes there in terms of maybe COGS doing a better job on your cost or KS mix. So any commonality there? And then if we kind of reached the point here, because I assume the KS mix will continue to get better and how you buy that will continue to get better where there should be an upward drift in gross just secularly because the elasticity of what you would choose to invest in kind of doesn't merit right, putting all of that back into the market pricewise.\n\n---\n\nI don't -- I'd like to think that we were that smart. Overall, I mean, we try to improve margins a little by lowering prices and I mean that sincerely. And we're going to give most of it back to the customer and to our member. As you know, we're pretty stubborn and intent on maintaining, in a rising commodity standpoint, prices on certain fresh foods, so we've seen some impact there to the negative. I think you're right though, as we continue to improve increased penetration of KS, that helps a little. Certainly, as we've had relative strength in the departments over the last couple of years, like softlines and domestics and housewares and some of those items, we can improve that a little bit. And that's, of course, outside of the ancillary and other businesses, which in some cases, work on higher margins as a starting point, be it pharmacy or hearing aid center or optometry or whatever else so -- but organics helps in a small way. I had mentioned in the past not only organics relative to their substitute, the nonorganic same products. Organics sell at a higher price point but our view is that others, while it may be competitive, we actually can be -- we show a more competitive framework and a little bit higher margin than the underlying nonorganic items. So it's really, in our view, a win-win for us. The challenge being getting more organic, and that's not a challenge -- just a challenge for us, of course. It's a challenge for everybody out there. So all those things help. I don't think we started the fiscal quarter and said, let's see how we'd get an extra 10 or 15 or 20 basis points higher than year-over-year, but we're trying to improve a little as we know we have challenges elsewhere.\n\n---\n\nAnd do you think -- I know this is particularly, I think, more in softlines. But do you think that the quality of KS -- it seems to continue to get better, maybe at a faster pace even than it has in the recent past. Do you think that's fair, the quality is getting better, that's the investment, not price point so much?\n\n---\n\nWell, I think 2 things. On the softlines side, like apparel and everything, we've -- over the last few years, we've made a bigger effort in that area. We took what sometimes would be a retail branded item at $200 to $300 for a pair of slacks that were $49.99, but when you go out and buy the same fabric and make, hopefully, a very good quality item and commit to 0.5 million or 1 million units of something, that helps. So we're always pushing the quality and the quantity and buying power of that, and that quality value relationship continues to, I think, improve.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then just lastly, I don't think you guys have done a whole lot of data mining, right, with your membership base. Do you see that -- does IT modernization allow you to do that? And then I'm wondering, when you think about sales, sort of comp sales by comparable member, I'm just curious when you look going forward, do you guys see a bigger opportunity to get, and I'm not going to say the most loyal members, maybe somebody a little bit below the top, to come in more frequently and that's a fresh food driver or more of an opportunity to get product -- more items in the basket per trip when you think about sustainability of comps by somebody who's been a member for whatever, 3, 5, 6 years. Where do you see the bigger opportunity?\n\n---\n\nWell, first and foremost, we've gone from doing virtually nothing to being a little more open-minded about it. I think there's a lot of low-hanging fruit that we haven't done. Certainly, there's more efforts in these areas, in our membership marketing team on dot-com a little bit, but we don't do a lot with it, but we're doing a little more than we used to. I mean, we must get a call a week from some analytics company that wants to film stuff, to do A/B testing, is the ketchup left to right of the mustard. We've done, I think, a better job on our multi-vendor mailer in terms of that. But we have -- I think we have more opportunities than we've even touched the surface on. But I'm not suggesting that's going to be tomorrow afternoon. Marketing has definitely been told to try some new things, and we have and they generally work. I view that more as something if things start to slow a little bit, we have some opportunities there. But we're, first and foremost, focused on just constantly driving quality and value on the products and services we sell. And that's -- we seem to have not figured out where the bottom of that is.\n\n---\n\nI guess I just have a couple of questions. I think last quarter, you had quantified the impact on the gas profit. I think you said it benefited by $0.01. I was wondering if you could give us that same metric this quarter. And the second question I have is I think with some of the remodels that are going on, can you just talk a little bit about category focus in the remodels and your expectation on what the returns and the comp uplifts we might see?\n\n---\n\nWhat was the first question? I lost...\n\n---\n\nGas profit.\n\n---\n\nYes. I think last quarter, there was not a big impact. There's a wash year-over-year. It's more than a few cents but not a heck of a lot. We really don't talk about it other than directionally, which way it helped us. Certainly, I think 4 of -- at least 4 of the last 5 fiscal quarters on a year-over-year basis, it's been up -- more outsized than normal up. And the second question?\n\n---\n\nRemodels. Trends in remodels, what would be the expectation that you see category focuses, and how that might impact comp store sales as we sort of go through this?\n\n---\n\nSure. A theme with my remodels, I think traditional retail stores remodeled, they're doing a whole new front, new flooring and new lighting fixtures. I mean, a lot of our remodels are everything, and we spent a lot of money on increasing refrigeration in frozen and the fresh foods area, that continues -- as somebody mentioned earlier, that continues to be a driver of our business and certainly, something we're pretty good at. We constantly try to figure out what locations that we don't have, where we can put gas stations, although we're saturating that, there's certain existing locations that are never going to have a gas station. But we still have a few left there. And we, of course, have added some gas stations in a few other countries beyond just the U.S. and Canada. So there's little things like that. There's typically half a dozen or so units here where we're breaking out a wall buying some extra land perhaps, adding 10,000 or 20,000 feet, where it makes sense. And many times, it makes sense economically when there's some government incentives on solar. That's small dollar-wise, but I'm just throwing out some examples. So remodeling for us is just constantly sometimes improving and updating something, but a lot of times, just adding some more stuff. More lineal feet of refrigeration is something that comes to mind in a bigger way over the last few years.\n\n---\n\nAnd then just one question on the ancillary businesses, can you just talk a little bit about what's happening in the photo business, trends in the quarter and sort of what the expectations are there?\n\n---\n\nWell, you probably are processing less photos than you used to. It's actually about -- the business itself profitability-wise is about flat year-over-year. Actual photos processed is down. We've enhanced the business on a few other things with everything from canvas pictures, to photo books, to ink refill cartridges, toner cartridges. And -- but it's not a business that's going to come back tomorrow either. It's -- of all the ancillary businesses, that's the one that's -- it's big, it's profitable, it's not as profitable as it used to be. But it's -- we'll continue to look at that space and see what we want to do. But we still have it, and it's still -- we still try to figure out how to improve it.\n\n---\n\nRichard, this is Meredith Adler. I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about kind of what happened with the store openings this year, which I think missed your expectations. I know some slipped into next year. But were there any common themes in that? And when you look out, because you've got a nice number of openings for next year, do you think that there's any risk based on what happened in fiscal '15?\n\n---\n\nSure. There's always going to be risk. I think prior to the fiscal '15, for the few years leading up to that, we actually got better on track of getting close to what we think is going to actually open. We booked -- this is our original budget. Everything that -- if everything generally goes right, and it's been green inked, if you will, it's been approved internally. We -- based on whatever permits and zoning issues and whatever, all the issues that are out there, we think we have a decent chance of opening it, we're going to put it in there, recognizing inevitably there's always 5 or 8 of those units that are budgeted for months 11 and 12, if not a few more, of that fiscal year. Maybe 10 units a year in that last month or 2. And inevitably a few of those fall out. I think that we'll get closer than we did this year relative to our budget. Generally speaking, it's not because we decided not to do a unit, that we were going to do it. The only time that happens or virtually every time that happens, it's something because something was -- became a big surprise. Doing additional drilling, we found something on the site that was a bigger issue. And that, by the way, is generally not a risk because when we do a site, it's for virtually all of them, nearly all of them. We have to feel comfortable we'd be able to do it before we commit to it. I think we'll get closer.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And there wasn't any common theme to the ones that didn't open this year or got delayed.\n\n---\n\nNo. It's every one's a unique story but it's just typical delays, weather, zoning, other surprises that are unrelated to competition or anything else out there.\n\n---\n\nCan you give us a little more detail on the traffic trends not only this quarter but over the last few years? Are you seeing more of the growth coming from the middle tier of the membership base? Presumably, the most frequent members are capped out. They can no longer -- they cannot grow the number of times they're going to Costco. So is it more so coming from the mid-tier of the membership population? Or is it more like the least attached members are getting a little bit more attached?\n\n---\n\nMaybe people in our membership and operations know a little more than I do here. And maybe there's some more opportunity -- yes, overall, over time, shops go up as people are making more each year, as they're having a family, whatever those issues are. And so certainly, an older member, in terms of how long they've been a member, that increases over time. But it's a lot of things. It's the merchandising. It's the frequency drivers like fresh foods and gas. It's that incremental shopping, because somebody all of a sudden needs a maintenance prescription. They've gone to the age where they're going to come in on one extra time a year because of the timing of their need for cholesterol-reducing drug or whatever. So it's a lot of little things plus a few of those things, notable things, like fresh foods and gas. It's also Executive membership. It's also the co-branded card and rewards. It really is all of the above. I don't -- then there's, yes, different reasons. Clearly, where we have new members, whether it was new millennial members or 20 years ago, new gen whatever members, they buy less when they start. They buy more over time. I can't tell you what millennial is going to do relative to their predecessor age groups overall, not just at Costco but overall buying. If they have smaller houses and they drive a little less and they buy fewer sofas, that is not good for anybody. But at the end of the day, we think we're getting our share.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And my follow-up question is how do you notice or how do you observe your membership population respond to different types of promotions? When I say promotions, I'm talking about price investments, rewards through your card, maybe new merchandise offers. Can you give us a sense what's been most impactful and how the responses benefit to drive up basket, has it been to allow you to sign up more members?\n\n---\n\nWell, first of all, we're not going to share all the specifics. But at the end of the day, it's a little bit of all of the above. We work every day to try to improve the value proposition to the member. We work every day to try to upsize an item where it makes sense because we do want more things and more dollars in that basket, and we -- maybe something like the multi-vendor mailer with the couponing that grew dramatically from what was originally a 6- or 8-week summer item, summer couponing booklet, to 11 or so times a year for 3-plus weeks each. And over time, we and our vendors figure out what works best and what starts to slow down. So those things keep getting tweaked. So again, there's -- we focus on trying to improve the value. If we can sell you a bigger pack size at a greater value, we're going to do that. I think that's a catch, too. We don't just want to increase the size of something 50% and sell it at the same price per ounce or price per number of units. We only want to raise it -- for the most part, we try to raise only the quantity or -- the quantity when we can lower the price per unit to the member. And that serves us well and it serves them well. So that's our religion.\n\n---\n\nSure. I'm thinking more about the card. Does that have as much influence in a member's purchase decision or frequency as pricing or coupons, for example?\n\n---\n\nWell, I don't know if one has more than the other. We know that the Executive members shop a lot -- take a group of 100,000 members that are similar in terms of shopping patterns and age groups and tenures of member, and they're both growing -- both of those groups are growing at roughly the same rate each year. Yet half of them convert to Executive member and you see a dramatic change in their buying habits. But that's no change that we've seen over the years that -- I think what surprises me personally is the continued penetration of that area. And maybe we've gotten a little better in store of doing that. Clearly, loyalty programs work, whether it's our Executive member program or our Reward-based co-branded credit card. One of the things that's long-term exciting for us is we feel that we can continue, even on our co-brand card, continue to improve the value proposition to our members, which hopefully gets them in here more often but that's what we do every day.\n\n---\n\nA couple here. First of all, can you talk about the new member sign-up trends in the fourth quarter? I, didn't hear, if you did mention that, I apologize. I know they were down slightly in the third quarter.\n\n---\n\nThey're actually up in the fourth quarter year-over-year, a combination of decent member sign-ups in existing warehouses, probably a few more international units in the quarter on a comparable year-over-year basis in the quarter. I think we're up a little over 2 million members in the quarter from a year ago in terms of new sign-ups.\n\n---\n\nOkay, great. And then, I mean, you mentioned when you gave the regional color, you said that Texas was good. But can you talk about maybe trends in some of the specific energy markets in like Houston, maybe some markets up in Alberta. Have you seen any kind of moderation in traffic or ticket or what have you?\n\n---\n\nI just don't have that amount of granularity in front of me.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then the thought process behind repatriated cash from Canada, why now? And then you've got a $1.2 billion note that comes due in December. Any thoughts here to refinance that or pay off?\n\n---\n\nAt this point, we'll probably pay it off. Part of the repatriation is Canada is a very profitable country so we've built up cash balances. At some point, we've determined -- on an ongoing basis, we will determine whether we feel it needs to be permanently invested up there or not and at such time, we'll make that decision. I think we've done that twice. About a year ago, we brought back a little over $1 billion. And in this case, it was favorable from a -- a small favorable from a tax perspective. A year ago, I think it was the third or fourth quarter a year ago, it was slightly unfavorable, but again -- but small, and we determined it was the right time to bring it back from a permanent reinvestment standpoint.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Fair enough. And then last question just on CapEx of $2.8 billion to $3 billion this year, almost double what you did maybe a few years ago. Understand you've got some of the investments you're doing, the higher store growth. Is that a level you think is one that we should assume kind of holds for several years assuming you can open 30-plus stores per year or are some of the investments you're doing in IT and systems and distribution, do those kinds of taper off a bit maybe in the outyears, just how you're thinking about that?\n\n---\n\nI hope IT tapers off a little, but that's not the biggest piece of it. I think I'm certainly comfortable saying it's going to be in the 2.5 to 3 range. Is the 2.8 to 3.0 this year, 100 or 200 -- likely be 100 or 200 higher than the following year? Maybe. I don't see the 2.8 to 3 going to 3.5 next year. So yes, something in the high 2s is probably a good guesstimate for the next few years.\n\n---\n\nI actually have some follow-ups on some of the questions that have already been asked, but I want to get some clarity. So I think Michael Lasser was asking about the Visa card. And I guess, real specifically, do you anticipate that, that card will actually drive membership growth, Richard?\n\n---\n\nWhen we get there, we'll let you know.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then following up a little bit on John Heinbockel and kind of the technology. When you're looking at your Executive members, do you guys have clarity into the data to say how many -- are these Executive members using our ancillary services? What are they using? And kind of what the penetration rates are?\n\n---\n\nYes. Absolutely. But we're not going to share with you what those are. Each ancillary business is a little different. Some of them take a decade to really get some good footing, but they're all great values and yet another reason why somebody wants to be a member, and we'll keep improving those values. So those are -- whether it's KS or organic or commodities or these items, these are all things, I think, that gives us a good competitive position.\n\n---\n\nAnd do you think there's an opportunity to drive additional ancillary business growth with your core members?\n\n---\n\nAbsolutely. Absolutely. I would recommend that you try Costco Travel, you'll be amazed.\n\n---\n\nI'm looking right now at a Costco car buying program. So I hear that's wonderful as well.\n\n---\n\nThat as well. I think we're approaching 0.5 million cars, new cars a year. And there's a reason, we use our buying power to get our members great savings on cars.\n\n---\n\nAnd when you think about getting a little bit more involved in technology, the relationship with your customers is one area that you would think could be a lever that could be thrown?\n\n---\n\nI'm sorry, say that again?\n\n---\n\nWhen you're looking at data mining, knowing your customers a little bit better, market a little bit more aggressive, I think you mentioned at the beginning, is this an area that we're going to focus, do you think?\n\n---\n\nAt some point, and we're kind of a little self-deprecating when we talk about that. At the end of the day, there's a lot of opportunities to do a lot of that stuff. We kind of look at the 80-20 rule. We're doing a little of it, which we're getting some benefits. There'll be plenty of opportunities to do some of that in the future, but we -- our main focus is on driving value and a lot of those other things take care of themselves. And then certainly, Craig Jelinek, who's our CEO, has told people in e-commerce, people in membership marketing, try some things, and they're trying some things. And we'll keep going in that direction.\n\n---\n\nPerfect. And then just one last kind of follow-on. This is when Bob was talking about the remodels. I'm just trying to understand, our local Costcos under remodel in the fresh department. I mean, if you look at '16 and '17, is that the focus of the remodels? Or are you expecting more of them? And is it focused on fresh? It seemed like that's where the focus was. I just want to get clarity. Is it going up kind of year-over-year?\n\n---\n\nI think as a general rule, it's been going up, but it's up. It's a big number, and I don't know if it keeps going up from there. I know the one across the street here, we, again, added 10,000 or 15,000 feet. We expanded greatly the walk-in coolers for customers in produce and dairy. When you're doing in some of these units $200 million, $250 million, $300 million, you can drive some true incremental good sales by not only expanding the -- everything in terms of the traffic patterns and the ingress, egress, in and outside of the warehouse but adding some of these things like refrigeration, fresh foods. And there will still be -- continue to be a big number.\n\n---\n\nAll right. So you're doing more fresh remodels, fresh drives traffic. Is the focus on that fresh area on organics or just general or is it weighted towards organics, do you know?\n\n---\n\nWell, I think in terms of CapEx-related, it's everything. Our organics is just a piece of that.\n\n---\n\nYou've gone over an hour and I still have a couple of questions. So one is a follow-up on gas. What was the average gas price in the quarter versus last? And if you could give us the gallons as well, that would be great.\n\n---\n\nThe average price in Q4 was 3.65 a year ago and 2.88 this current fourth quarter, so down 21.2%.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And if that's the case, I guess, going back to gas profitability, I understand it's been a tailwind. I guess it's that incremental drop even from last quarter that's really allowed the profitability to boost up again. Is that -- are we thinking about that right?\n\n---\n\nActually, the price was -- from a quarter ago, the price was up about $0.20 a gallon. But I think there's a little bit of a new normal. It's not just how it is year-over-year. It's when it's low, it's better from a profitability standpoint, and it's relative to competition. I mean, GasBuddy has continued to say that we're the lowest price out there nationally, and I think we're still pretty going to be very competitive. And we get a lot of good kudos from that.\n\n---\n\nSo basically, you can keep your competitive advantage but the $0.01 profit might be better than it used to be the way the market is.\n\n---\n\nYes. I think when prices are low, we make more than we used to on average per gallon or per gas station, and that's good.\n\n---\n\nRight. And then the second question was going back to membership fee income. I think you said it was 6% if you exclude FX.\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nI believe, that's 100 or maybe 200 bps below the trend the last year or 2. Is that just fewer openings last year? Or I think last quarter you mentioned sign-ups for club was actually negative but it was a comparison issue. Just help us understand...\n\n---\n\nI think overall, it's just fine. There's a little bit in Canada of the auto renewal issue when we switched over, and we'll see that again the year hence, over the next year, starting next year. That's a small piece of it. I don't think beyond that there's a whole lot there in that regard. There's always going to be the timing because membership fee dollar increases are -- we used deferred accounting for it. And so that makes it a little more squishy number, but overall, the number was in line with what we felt was pretty good.\n\n---\n\nAnd with the auto renewal effect -- I guess I'll sneak a third one in. If I remember correctly, Amex is roughly 40% of the tender in the stores. So to think of the magnitude that it had in Canada when you did the changeover, what was Amex...\n\n---\n\nWell, there's one big difference. In Canada, the portfolio was not purchased. While I can't guarantee it would purchase, the contracts states that it should be, and we're working towards that, or Citi and Amex are working towards that end. That's a different scenario in terms of auto renewal. Up there, you basically have to re-sign people up. They have to apply for credit. They get authorized. They have to re-sign, opt in for auto renewal. I don't expect that to be an issue in the U.S. at this point.\n\n---\n\nGot it. And the tender there is roughly the same as here, at 40%?\n\n---\n\nI think it was a little less but mind you, the market share of our provider up there historically had a lower market share there relative to Canada than they do in the U.S., we have stronger market share down here.\n\n---\n\nFirst question relates to Spain, just curious on your learnings from your first Spain opening and how you expect your continental European stores to differ from your other international markets based on what you saw from that first unit.\n\n---\n\nWell, like any first unit with maybe the exception of Australia, which was off the charts high to start with, you learn a lot. You learn what sells and doesn't sell. I think if I recall from when we first opened in Seville 1.5 years, 2 years ago, we had less -- we had stronger non-food than we would've expected and not a strong fresh food. Usually, with a new market, you've got stronger fresh food. Given our great success in countries like Korea and Taiwan and Japan, we have to remind ourselves that Korea and Taiwan, they were not very good for several years. You start off with slower sales in most countries other than Australia when you first enter -- when we first enter the market, and that was consistent. Probably the worst economy we started was in Spain, but we're seeing some traction. Membership sign-ups are just fine, and membership renewals have been just fine. But one data point does not a story make here. But Madrid is certainly is a much bigger market than Seville. And we've got a unit, one unit coming next month, and a second one is coming, I believe, next spring, certainly, sometime in the middle of the calendar year. So that will be more telling in our view than anything we've seen so far. We continue to be very confident that we've got a good model that works and we're patient as well.\n\n---\n\nA quick second question. On the online and e-commerce piece, Instacart, I know, is a particularly prominent partnership among the ones that you've got, and it's a concept that from -- in terms of the number of retailers it's doing business with and how long that's hung in, seems to be gaining some traction. Any sense as to how that relationship has evolved, in particular, how the economics look for you relative to some of the alternatives.\n\n---\n\nWell, again, we're not going to disclose any specifics. We have a good working relationship with Instacart, with -- certainly, with Google Shopping Express as well, and Instacarts in more cities. And anybody you know up there that wants to buy from us, you call us.\n\n---\n\nFair enough. And then finally, I think Greg -- one element of Greg's question might not have gotten an answer was gallon comps. You talked a bit about the gas prices. But I remember when gas prices first started coming under pressure, gallon comps surged into double digits. Are you still seeing that with the prices down here today?\n\n---\n\nI'm not sure if it's double digits, but it's certainly positive. And we generally haven't given that out, but sometimes in a moment of weakness, I share it with you guys. But the comps have continued to go in the right direction in terms of gallons.\r\nThank you, everyone. Have a good day.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Charles Grom (Analysts)】\nJust on the core margin performance in the quarter, I think you said was up 13 basis points. Could you delve into the performance by the 4 subcategories? I know you said that food, hardlines and softlines were all up. Just curious, the -- why the pressure on the fresh food side?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nYes. Well, I think the pressure in the fresh food side is us. We -- when you got some inflation, some of the commodity items like eggs or nuts, you've got -- we're not changing the price of a 16-pack of muffins or a slice of pizza or a hotdog, so it has more to do with that and nothing really surprising there. If you look at each of those 4 categories, again, overall, the gross margin is a percent of sale -- of their own sales, year-over-year in the quarter was up 13. I think the range was in the low 20s on the high side and the mid-teens on that negative downside. So pretty much similar, slightly above last year. No real big changes there.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Grom (Analysts)】\nOkay, good. And then when you look to next year, just kind of switching gears a little bit, when you switched to Visa from Amex, can you shape out for us how the switch is going to work and be handled and what you're planning to do with the interchange savings that you're going to generate? And also, just looking back how you handled it in Canada, any surprises on that front?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nNo. I mean, things in Canada, first of all, went fine. A little different in Canada because of certain Canadian issues. The portfolio was not purchased by the new issuer so we had essentially -- you had people apply for it. That being said, they shop at Costco, they want that co-branded card and they're just fine. You see a little bit of change in renewal rate when that happens because of auto renewals. You've got to re-sign people up and everything, but from an improvement in terms of additional monies, be it for us in terms of lower merchant fees or our members in terms of a better rewards on the co-brand, that's all been as planned. In the U.S., we're working through everything right now. The plan is for -- again, the current contract ends March -- at the end of March next year. That could be in or around 1 month or 2 from there. The 2 parties, Amex and Citi, continue to work towards that end, and we would expect to tell you more when -- where we can. In terms of how it's going to be split between merchant fees and rewards, I think I've stated in the past our philosophy is when we save money on product purchases, we want to get most of it back to the consumer, to the customer. And we're looking at all kinds of opportunities to do that, so stay tuned.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Grom (Analysts)】\nOkay, fair enough. And just last question. August comps were obviously pretty good. Just wondering, with September almost closed here, any surprises on September sales for you guys?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nIf I could tell you, I would. We'll wait until next week.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Simeon Gutman (Analysts)】\nQuick question. I think you telegraphed this on the sales side Labor Day. Realizing it was in September both years, but this year, the quarter may not have caught I guess the lead up to it. I don't know if that's a big deal from a sales or earnings perspective. Just quickly on that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nMore of just a sales perspective given you're talking mid-single, low single-digit numbers reported -- normalized and reported. We basically -- in August, it was -- we feel negative impact of about 1 percentage point, and there'll be a corresponding improvement in September reported for the same reason because of the -- but it's 4 weeks versus 5, so it's a little less of a positive, maybe 0.7% or 0.8% if our crystal ball is correct. So yes, the August numbers were impacted negatively a little. The September number will show a little positive in that and we'll point that out in the release.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Simeon Gutman (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then the second question on membership fees and the potential increases. Just a question on the thought process, and I think in the past, largely, you've done them to cover inflation. I'm sure there's an inflation over the past 5 years in many areas. So can you talk about considerations and how you think about it? Are you surveying? Are you probing customers understand what's tolerable and then taking into account that the landscape is evolving a little? You have some nontraditional online model and membership models. So how do you think about the right range to raise that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, I think we've done 6 $5 increases over roughly 30 years, generally about every 5 or so years. We don't do a lot of polling. We look at it internally if -- have we improved the value of that membership to our member? In terms of the tolerability of it to the member, I know our historical $5, and in the case of the Executive Member last time 5 years ago, a $10 increase is a hell of a lot less than we see in other types of fees out there, be it fees for your television or your phones or other services out there. So I personally don't think it's going to ever be an issue. When is -- we really haven't talked about it a lot. It's something that we'll probably do at some point, but stay tuned.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Trussell (Analysts)】\nI wanted to just discuss assortment and fulfillment online. Certainly, across the industry, there's been a lot of competition in investments being made in fulfillment, whether it's Amazon or jet.com, or some of the newer initiatives from Sam's Club. Could you just discuss some of your recent one-line sales trends and any updates that you could provide for us on upcoming enhancements around assortment or fulfillment online?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nI don't there's -- I mean, in terms of -- there are a few things I had mentioned over the last few quarters on a topical basis. We certainly expanded, to some extent, the SKU selection and added what I'd call more frequent -- frequently purchased items, be it food and sundries or a few office needs, everything from, again, sundry items to health and beauty aids, K-Cups, few apparel items. And so we've expanded that. We took certain key departments and brought them in line, so we're not competing with each other and providing, I think, a little more excitement to that. We ship out at more than 1 depot. When we first started this for the first several years in the U.S., everything we shipped out at 1 depot in Southern California, which meant it might take a little longer to get to you and it cost us a little more in terms of delivery or the member. And as we've expanded, we've improved that quite a bit as well. And quite a bit for us. And we're pleased with the fact that sales for the last, gosh, the last 2 or 3 years, at least, have been on year-over-year comp basis around 20%. So we're doing it methodically. We're not going to go crazy out there. I think our mobile apps have improved and will continue to improve, and we like the value proposition we have. We're recognizing that we can't be everything to everybody. That's not what we do for a living, and -- but we have great value. We also like the fact that some of these other services are buying from us. Some our top customers are some of those guys. So if we can't deliver that single unit of milk or cereal to your doorstep, someone, that is, may want to buy from us.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Trussell (Analysts)】\nGot it. That's helpful. And you spoke about the impact to margins from an IT monetization standpoint. Could you just give us a little more detail about what some of the latest focus points have been in terms of system upgrades and what we should be looking forward to you all tackling over the fiscal '16 period?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, going back, again, 3-ish years ago, we embarked on a pretty significant effort to really upgrade and modernize our systems. Our systems were, for the most part, legacy systems. Many of them written in-house. Many of them, what I have to say, were band-aided over the years and worked fine but were arguably strained. Some of the systems that were included in there that were not legacy were from outside suppliers that were not going to be supported going forward, or had not been supported. And so we probably started a little later than we should have a few years ago and we had a lot going on. And as I've indicated over the last -- each quarter, frankly, what we try to do is just show you really what the expense associated with those incremental efforts are. We've installed our new membership system a little under a year ago, I think. We installed a new point-of-sale system, which is another deliverable, and few others. A lot of small deliverables that I won't go into. We've got several more over that are heavy into the expense side and should be forthcoming over the next year to 2 years. The other thing I mentioned in terms of we're -- I talked we're extending SG&A. On an incremental basis over the last few years, I think we're now up to something in the low teens, 12, 13 basis points, those 2s, 3s and 5s that have added each year. And recognizing your denominator, your sales, this expense over sales, sales keep increasing. We're seeing all the costs associated with it. I think we'll start to see benefits when we look out beyond '16. It doesn't mean that this SG&A line will not go up a few more basis points. We'll see. But we're -- there's light at the end of the tunnel. It's -- sometimes it's long -- some days, it's a longer tunnel than the others, but we're starting to see some deliverables from it. So there's not a lot I can tell you about where the benefits are. There are clearly some benefits that we're going to see in the transportation side in some of the ancillary businesses like travel and other things, but the big switchover will be when buyers are buying on a new system a year or so down the road and as well as the benefits in transportation and other, but we don't want to put any dollars or basis points in those improvements. We had to do this if we want to double our size over a 10 or so year period, starting a couple of years ago with these expenses because we had a lot of systems that were really strained. And this is going to set us up for the years to come.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Oliver Chen (Analysts)】\nRegarding a bigger picture question, and I was curious about your thoughts on what really sets you apart from other Internet pure plays in terms of your supply chain and vertical integration and kind of this buying scale and scale you have out there. And then, also, international is a nice piece of the business. Just as we look at our models and talk to this part of the story, which countries do you have the most opportunity to increase your store base versus maximum potential?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nSure. Well, in terms of e-commerce, I mean, first, we're different because we -- yes, for us, we have a lot more items. We have 8,000 or 10,000 or so instead of 3,700 in store. That's a nit compared to everybody else out there that has hundreds of thousands, if not millions of items. I think what separates us is we've got -- certainly, we and others, will have great quality merchandise. We've got the best pricing overall. We work on margins that are at or slightly below our reported total company margins, but up there in high singles, very low double digits. We'll compare that to anybody out there. Again, we recognize we're not going to be selling single items delivered within 1 hour or 4 hours or overnight necessarily. The -- but in a methodical way, we think we're doing just fine, and we think we'll have additional opportunities. And as I mentioned earlier, we're selling to a lot of these other guys that are wanting to deliver in certain unique ways. There's room for all of us. We've got to keep -- there's a -- it's a big pie out there in terms of market share, and we think that we'll be able to take our share of that. Some little sub-departments, you lose a little. Others, you make a little. Certainly, we want people to still come into our warehouses. In terms of opportunities outside of -- in terms of warehouse club growth opportunities, I think the first comment for those of you on the call who have known us for a long time, the market potential keeps improving. I don't think we ever would have thought, when we had 60 or 70 locations in Canada, we never thought we'd have more than 80. We now have more than that. We will certainly be over 100 at some point in the next several years. In the U.S., we're expanding. If you asked me 5 years ago, when we were 80 U.S., 20 international, I'd say, 5 years hence or now, it's probably 50/50 and going further south in terms of the percentage of openings in the U.S. We keep finding more opportunities here, so that's good news. In terms of other countries, we think we've certainly got a lot of potential in the 3 countries in Asia we're currently at. Bigger market, of course, is Japan, much bigger than Korea and Taiwan, but we think we can go from the low teens in each of Taiwan and Korea, double over the next 10 years, but we'll see, it's one at a time. Australia, we only have 7 units in -- 7 in a country that's, what, 2/3 or a little more than the population of Canada, which has 80 or 90. And I'm not suggesting we're going to have 2/3 of that anytime soon, but we certainly could add a few there. Western Europe, we'll see. It's been tough getting in with all the rules, regulations and permitting process, but we're pretty interested in continuing that process. Again, we'll open our second unit in Spain next month in Madrid in Getafe. Our third unit -- second in the Madrid area next calendar year, and hopefully, our first in France towards the end of the next fiscal year. So we think there's plenty of opportunities. I think we feel comfortable that, over the next 5 years, we'll continue to open 30-ish plus units a year. And then we thought we would do that this year that just ended, up and certainly in the high 20s. And a few of those got delayed, and that's life. But we've got a pipeline that's full. The international, generally, takes a lot longer for a variety of reasons by country. And -- but so we think we'll continue to grow and do just fine in terms of that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Oliver Chen (Analysts)】\nOkay. And Richard, just a quick follow-up. There has been talk in terms of competitors in relation to how competitors are dealing with vendors. Could you just update us on your thoughts on your vendor relationships and any catalyst there given your buying scale and your leverage and your heritage? I was just curious on your thoughts.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, I'd like to think that the comment that we share internally and we talk to you guys about is that we're tough but fair. We are tough. We fight for our member every day, and we -- I'd like to think that we do that as much if not more than anybody else. The good news about us in terms of our view of our competitiveness is we give the vast majority of any improvement back to the member, and that, in our view, creates that moat that hopefully continues to get bigger. We -- one of the challenges and opportunities we have is just the sheer size of our needs of various commodities, organics, nuts, long staple cotton, you name it. And so we've got a lot of efforts in that area that I think many of our competitors don't necessary go to that level because they're dealing with vendors and lots more items. And so I think we have some opportunities and challenges that -- but opportunities and challenges that I think create something special about us. I don't think anything's changed. As we get bigger we can be tougher but still fair, and we work with our vendors. We think we have good relationships with them. I would assume that most of them would agree. Probably a few don't. But we'll continue to be very transparent in how we deal with our vendors. And we have very good relationships with many, many of them.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Binder (Analysts)】\nIt's Dan Binder. My question had to do with the ancillary margins. The last 5 quarters, you've had 3 quarters where ancillary margins were up about 15 basis points ex gas deflation and then 2 quarters where they were up substantially more than that. It happens to coincide with the decline in gas prices. And what I'm trying to understand is how much of that gross margin improvement in ancillary is sustainable versus just being a function of the way gas was fluctuating during the quarter?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, gas for, I think, most of the last 5 fiscal quarters on a year-over-year basis has helped a lot. But other -- the other ancillary business continued to grow, and whether it's optical or hearing aid or some of the other warehouse club businesses, all those things add up, travel, you name it. So I think -- I hope it's sustainable. Clearly, gas, we have no illusion that, at some point in life, gas prices go up and margins will be more normal relative to our history. Right now, it's good for our member in terms of low gas prices and good for us in terms of albeit at a lower top line sales, it's been more profitable on a year-over-year basis.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Binder (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then the other item I wanted to talk about was other income, which I realize is a function of these FX contracts you talked about earlier in the call. Always a challenge to model. I'm just curious if FX rates were to stay roughly where they are today, how do you think that line item would look in Q1?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nI don't know. All I can tell you is that we look at it that way, too. I mean, we manage it in the sense that if you got a foreign country where some of their inventory purchases are paid for in dollars or euros sometimes, but use dollars as the bigger example, they will -- once they're comfortable with a price point, that they're going to be able to convert at that level and sell goods in their local currency, in their local country, they're going to choose to figure out how much of that they want to lock in, recognizing locking in just means that they're comfortable with that price. If the local currency continues to weaken, that was good. If the local currency strengthens relative to the U.S. dollar, we shouldn't have done as much. But we don't try to be completely right either way. And so I think over the years, the last 4, 5 years, that's a number that has probably ranged from plus or minus 15 million pretax, usually a little less than the number that we had this period where it's up about 15 or so. But I'd say it's -- we just want to point it out because it's a component of the income statement. It's very hard to predict. I think by doing the way we do it, we're not going to ever have any giant surprise either way because of some drastic change in FX prices.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Binder (Analysts)】\nAnd then the last item, the share repurchase picked up a bit this quarter. How are you thinking about it for next -- for this coming year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, we'll tell you each quarter end. It's part of our -- what we do with our cash. As long as we feel good about our future, we're not going to ever be -- we're going to buy on a regular basis, not try to take the market. I think the fact that we bought a little more this quarter is the stock shifted down a little bit. But as I've said in the past, we buy a little more when it goes down, and we -- but we certainly -- I certainly feel comfortable about our future prospects as a company. So don't expect giant changes in how we've done it in the past. Certainly, we trended each quarter this year on an annualized basis upward, and we're certainly comfortable with the current level.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Heinbockel (Analysts)】\nSo Richard, if you look at the 3 categories or the 3 broad departments where you saw some margin improvement, so 2 things. Was there any common themes there in terms of maybe COGS doing a better job on your cost or KS mix. So any commonality there? And then if we kind of reached the point here, because I assume the KS mix will continue to get better and how you buy that will continue to get better where there should be an upward drift in gross just secularly because the elasticity of what you would choose to invest in kind of doesn't merit right, putting all of that back into the market pricewise.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nI don't -- I'd like to think that we were that smart. Overall, I mean, we try to improve margins a little by lowering prices and I mean that sincerely. And we're going to give most of it back to the customer and to our member. As you know, we're pretty stubborn and intent on maintaining, in a rising commodity standpoint, prices on certain fresh foods, so we've seen some impact there to the negative. I think you're right though, as we continue to improve increased penetration of KS, that helps a little. Certainly, as we've had relative strength in the departments over the last couple of years, like softlines and domestics and housewares and some of those items, we can improve that a little bit. And that's, of course, outside of the ancillary and other businesses, which in some cases, work on higher margins as a starting point, be it pharmacy or hearing aid center or optometry or whatever else so -- but organics helps in a small way. I had mentioned in the past not only organics relative to their substitute, the nonorganic same products. Organics sell at a higher price point but our view is that others, while it may be competitive, we actually can be -- we show a more competitive framework and a little bit higher margin than the underlying nonorganic items. So it's really, in our view, a win-win for us. The challenge being getting more organic, and that's not a challenge -- just a challenge for us, of course. It's a challenge for everybody out there. So all those things help. I don't think we started the fiscal quarter and said, let's see how we'd get an extra 10 or 15 or 20 basis points higher than year-over-year, but we're trying to improve a little as we know we have challenges elsewhere.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Heinbockel (Analysts)】\nAnd do you think -- I know this is particularly, I think, more in softlines. But do you think that the quality of KS -- it seems to continue to get better, maybe at a faster pace even than it has in the recent past. Do you think that's fair, the quality is getting better, that's the investment, not price point so much?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, I think 2 things. On the softlines side, like apparel and everything, we've -- over the last few years, we've made a bigger effort in that area. We took what sometimes would be a retail branded item at $200 to $300 for a pair of slacks that were $49.99, but when you go out and buy the same fabric and make, hopefully, a very good quality item and commit to 0.5 million or 1 million units of something, that helps. So we're always pushing the quality and the quantity and buying power of that, and that quality value relationship continues to, I think, improve.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Heinbockel (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then just lastly, I don't think you guys have done a whole lot of data mining, right, with your membership base. Do you see that -- does IT modernization allow you to do that? And then I'm wondering, when you think about sales, sort of comp sales by comparable member, I'm just curious when you look going forward, do you guys see a bigger opportunity to get, and I'm not going to say the most loyal members, maybe somebody a little bit below the top, to come in more frequently and that's a fresh food driver or more of an opportunity to get product -- more items in the basket per trip when you think about sustainability of comps by somebody who's been a member for whatever, 3, 5, 6 years. Where do you see the bigger opportunity?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, first and foremost, we've gone from doing virtually nothing to being a little more open-minded about it. I think there's a lot of low-hanging fruit that we haven't done. Certainly, there's more efforts in these areas, in our membership marketing team on dot-com a little bit, but we don't do a lot with it, but we're doing a little more than we used to. I mean, we must get a call a week from some analytics company that wants to film stuff, to do A/B testing, is the ketchup left to right of the mustard. We've done, I think, a better job on our multi-vendor mailer in terms of that. But we have -- I think we have more opportunities than we've even touched the surface on. But I'm not suggesting that's going to be tomorrow afternoon. Marketing has definitely been told to try some new things, and we have and they generally work. I view that more as something if things start to slow a little bit, we have some opportunities there. But we're, first and foremost, focused on just constantly driving quality and value on the products and services we sell. And that's -- we seem to have not figured out where the bottom of that is.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Drbul (Analysts)】\nI guess I just have a couple of questions. I think last quarter, you had quantified the impact on the gas profit. I think you said it benefited by $0.01. I was wondering if you could give us that same metric this quarter. And the second question I have is I think with some of the remodels that are going on, can you just talk a little bit about category focus in the remodels and your expectation on what the returns and the comp uplifts we might see?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWhat was the first question? I lost...\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Drbul (Analysts)】\nGas profit.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nYes. I think last quarter, there was not a big impact. There's a wash year-over-year. It's more than a few cents but not a heck of a lot. We really don't talk about it other than directionally, which way it helped us. Certainly, I think 4 of -- at least 4 of the last 5 fiscal quarters on a year-over-year basis, it's been up -- more outsized than normal up. And the second question?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Drbul (Analysts)】\nRemodels. Trends in remodels, what would be the expectation that you see category focuses, and how that might impact comp store sales as we sort of go through this?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nSure. A theme with my remodels, I think traditional retail stores remodeled, they're doing a whole new front, new flooring and new lighting fixtures. I mean, a lot of our remodels are everything, and we spent a lot of money on increasing refrigeration in frozen and the fresh foods area, that continues -- as somebody mentioned earlier, that continues to be a driver of our business and certainly, something we're pretty good at. We constantly try to figure out what locations that we don't have, where we can put gas stations, although we're saturating that, there's certain existing locations that are never going to have a gas station. But we still have a few left there. And we, of course, have added some gas stations in a few other countries beyond just the U.S. and Canada. So there's little things like that. There's typically half a dozen or so units here where we're breaking out a wall buying some extra land perhaps, adding 10,000 or 20,000 feet, where it makes sense. And many times, it makes sense economically when there's some government incentives on solar. That's small dollar-wise, but I'm just throwing out some examples. So remodeling for us is just constantly sometimes improving and updating something, but a lot of times, just adding some more stuff. More lineal feet of refrigeration is something that comes to mind in a bigger way over the last few years.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Drbul (Analysts)】\nAnd then just one question on the ancillary businesses, can you just talk a little bit about what's happening in the photo business, trends in the quarter and sort of what the expectations are there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, you probably are processing less photos than you used to. It's actually about -- the business itself profitability-wise is about flat year-over-year. Actual photos processed is down. We've enhanced the business on a few other things with everything from canvas pictures, to photo books, to ink refill cartridges, toner cartridges. And -- but it's not a business that's going to come back tomorrow either. It's -- of all the ancillary businesses, that's the one that's -- it's big, it's profitable, it's not as profitable as it used to be. But it's -- we'll continue to look at that space and see what we want to do. But we still have it, and it's still -- we still try to figure out how to improve it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Meredith Adler (Analysts)】\nRichard, this is Meredith Adler. I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about kind of what happened with the store openings this year, which I think missed your expectations. I know some slipped into next year. But were there any common themes in that? And when you look out, because you've got a nice number of openings for next year, do you think that there's any risk based on what happened in fiscal '15?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nSure. There's always going to be risk. I think prior to the fiscal '15, for the few years leading up to that, we actually got better on track of getting close to what we think is going to actually open. We booked -- this is our original budget. Everything that -- if everything generally goes right, and it's been green inked, if you will, it's been approved internally. We -- based on whatever permits and zoning issues and whatever, all the issues that are out there, we think we have a decent chance of opening it, we're going to put it in there, recognizing inevitably there's always 5 or 8 of those units that are budgeted for months 11 and 12, if not a few more, of that fiscal year. Maybe 10 units a year in that last month or 2. And inevitably a few of those fall out. I think that we'll get closer than we did this year relative to our budget. Generally speaking, it's not because we decided not to do a unit, that we were going to do it. The only time that happens or virtually every time that happens, it's something because something was -- became a big surprise. Doing additional drilling, we found something on the site that was a bigger issue. And that, by the way, is generally not a risk because when we do a site, it's for virtually all of them, nearly all of them. We have to feel comfortable we'd be able to do it before we commit to it. I think we'll get closer.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Meredith Adler (Analysts)】\nOkay. And there wasn't any common theme to the ones that didn't open this year or got delayed.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nNo. It's every one's a unique story but it's just typical delays, weather, zoning, other surprises that are unrelated to competition or anything else out there.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Lasser (Analysts)】\nCan you give us a little more detail on the traffic trends not only this quarter but over the last few years? Are you seeing more of the growth coming from the middle tier of the membership base? Presumably, the most frequent members are capped out. They can no longer -- they cannot grow the number of times they're going to Costco. So is it more so coming from the mid-tier of the membership population? Or is it more like the least attached members are getting a little bit more attached?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nMaybe people in our membership and operations know a little more than I do here. And maybe there's some more opportunity -- yes, overall, over time, shops go up as people are making more each year, as they're having a family, whatever those issues are. And so certainly, an older member, in terms of how long they've been a member, that increases over time. But it's a lot of things. It's the merchandising. It's the frequency drivers like fresh foods and gas. It's that incremental shopping, because somebody all of a sudden needs a maintenance prescription. They've gone to the age where they're going to come in on one extra time a year because of the timing of their need for cholesterol-reducing drug or whatever. So it's a lot of little things plus a few of those things, notable things, like fresh foods and gas. It's also Executive membership. It's also the co-branded card and rewards. It really is all of the above. I don't -- then there's, yes, different reasons. Clearly, where we have new members, whether it was new millennial members or 20 years ago, new gen whatever members, they buy less when they start. They buy more over time. I can't tell you what millennial is going to do relative to their predecessor age groups overall, not just at Costco but overall buying. If they have smaller houses and they drive a little less and they buy fewer sofas, that is not good for anybody. But at the end of the day, we think we're getting our share.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Lasser (Analysts)】\nOkay. And my follow-up question is how do you notice or how do you observe your membership population respond to different types of promotions? When I say promotions, I'm talking about price investments, rewards through your card, maybe new merchandise offers. Can you give us a sense what's been most impactful and how the responses benefit to drive up basket, has it been to allow you to sign up more members?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, first of all, we're not going to share all the specifics. But at the end of the day, it's a little bit of all of the above. We work every day to try to improve the value proposition to the member. We work every day to try to upsize an item where it makes sense because we do want more things and more dollars in that basket, and we -- maybe something like the multi-vendor mailer with the couponing that grew dramatically from what was originally a 6- or 8-week summer item, summer couponing booklet, to 11 or so times a year for 3-plus weeks each. And over time, we and our vendors figure out what works best and what starts to slow down. So those things keep getting tweaked. So again, there's -- we focus on trying to improve the value. If we can sell you a bigger pack size at a greater value, we're going to do that. I think that's a catch, too. We don't just want to increase the size of something 50% and sell it at the same price per ounce or price per number of units. We only want to raise it -- for the most part, we try to raise only the quantity or -- the quantity when we can lower the price per unit to the member. And that serves us well and it serves them well. So that's our religion.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Lasser (Analysts)】\nSure. I'm thinking more about the card. Does that have as much influence in a member's purchase decision or frequency as pricing or coupons, for example?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, I don't know if one has more than the other. We know that the Executive members shop a lot -- take a group of 100,000 members that are similar in terms of shopping patterns and age groups and tenures of member, and they're both growing -- both of those groups are growing at roughly the same rate each year. Yet half of them convert to Executive member and you see a dramatic change in their buying habits. But that's no change that we've seen over the years that -- I think what surprises me personally is the continued penetration of that area. And maybe we've gotten a little better in store of doing that. Clearly, loyalty programs work, whether it's our Executive member program or our Reward-based co-branded credit card. One of the things that's long-term exciting for us is we feel that we can continue, even on our co-brand card, continue to improve the value proposition to our members, which hopefully gets them in here more often but that's what we do every day.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Peter Benedict (Analysts)】\nA couple here. First of all, can you talk about the new member sign-up trends in the fourth quarter? I, didn't hear, if you did mention that, I apologize. I know they were down slightly in the third quarter.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nThey're actually up in the fourth quarter year-over-year, a combination of decent member sign-ups in existing warehouses, probably a few more international units in the quarter on a comparable year-over-year basis in the quarter. I think we're up a little over 2 million members in the quarter from a year ago in terms of new sign-ups.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Peter Benedict (Analysts)】\nOkay, great. And then, I mean, you mentioned when you gave the regional color, you said that Texas was good. But can you talk about maybe trends in some of the specific energy markets in like Houston, maybe some markets up in Alberta. Have you seen any kind of moderation in traffic or ticket or what have you?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nI just don't have that amount of granularity in front of me.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Peter Benedict (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then the thought process behind repatriated cash from Canada, why now? And then you've got a $1.2 billion note that comes due in December. Any thoughts here to refinance that or pay off?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nAt this point, we'll probably pay it off. Part of the repatriation is Canada is a very profitable country so we've built up cash balances. At some point, we've determined -- on an ongoing basis, we will determine whether we feel it needs to be permanently invested up there or not and at such time, we'll make that decision. I think we've done that twice. About a year ago, we brought back a little over $1 billion. And in this case, it was favorable from a -- a small favorable from a tax perspective. A year ago, I think it was the third or fourth quarter a year ago, it was slightly unfavorable, but again -- but small, and we determined it was the right time to bring it back from a permanent reinvestment standpoint.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Peter Benedict (Analysts)】\nOkay. Fair enough. And then last question just on CapEx of $2.8 billion to $3 billion this year, almost double what you did maybe a few years ago. Understand you've got some of the investments you're doing, the higher store growth. Is that a level you think is one that we should assume kind of holds for several years assuming you can open 30-plus stores per year or are some of the investments you're doing in IT and systems and distribution, do those kinds of taper off a bit maybe in the outyears, just how you're thinking about that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nI hope IT tapers off a little, but that's not the biggest piece of it. I think I'm certainly comfortable saying it's going to be in the 2.5 to 3 range. Is the 2.8 to 3.0 this year, 100 or 200 -- likely be 100 or 200 higher than the following year? Maybe. I don't see the 2.8 to 3 going to 3.5 next year. So yes, something in the high 2s is probably a good guesstimate for the next few years.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Mushkin (Analysts)】\nI actually have some follow-ups on some of the questions that have already been asked, but I want to get some clarity. So I think Michael Lasser was asking about the Visa card. And I guess, real specifically, do you anticipate that, that card will actually drive membership growth, Richard?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWhen we get there, we'll let you know.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Mushkin (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then following up a little bit on John Heinbockel and kind of the technology. When you're looking at your Executive members, do you guys have clarity into the data to say how many -- are these Executive members using our ancillary services? What are they using? And kind of what the penetration rates are?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nYes. Absolutely. But we're not going to share with you what those are. Each ancillary business is a little different. Some of them take a decade to really get some good footing, but they're all great values and yet another reason why somebody wants to be a member, and we'll keep improving those values. So those are -- whether it's KS or organic or commodities or these items, these are all things, I think, that gives us a good competitive position.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Mushkin (Analysts)】\nAnd do you think there's an opportunity to drive additional ancillary business growth with your core members?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nAbsolutely. Absolutely. I would recommend that you try Costco Travel, you'll be amazed.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Mushkin (Analysts)】\nI'm looking right now at a Costco car buying program. So I hear that's wonderful as well.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nThat as well. I think we're approaching 0.5 million cars, new cars a year. And there's a reason, we use our buying power to get our members great savings on cars.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Mushkin (Analysts)】\nAnd when you think about getting a little bit more involved in technology, the relationship with your customers is one area that you would think could be a lever that could be thrown?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nI'm sorry, say that again?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Mushkin (Analysts)】\nWhen you're looking at data mining, knowing your customers a little bit better, market a little bit more aggressive, I think you mentioned at the beginning, is this an area that we're going to focus, do you think?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nAt some point, and we're kind of a little self-deprecating when we talk about that. At the end of the day, there's a lot of opportunities to do a lot of that stuff. We kind of look at the 80-20 rule. We're doing a little of it, which we're getting some benefits. There'll be plenty of opportunities to do some of that in the future, but we -- our main focus is on driving value and a lot of those other things take care of themselves. And then certainly, Craig Jelinek, who's our CEO, has told people in e-commerce, people in membership marketing, try some things, and they're trying some things. And we'll keep going in that direction.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Mushkin (Analysts)】\nPerfect. And then just one last kind of follow-on. This is when Bob was talking about the remodels. I'm just trying to understand, our local Costcos under remodel in the fresh department. I mean, if you look at '16 and '17, is that the focus of the remodels? Or are you expecting more of them? And is it focused on fresh? It seemed like that's where the focus was. I just want to get clarity. Is it going up kind of year-over-year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nI think as a general rule, it's been going up, but it's up. It's a big number, and I don't know if it keeps going up from there. I know the one across the street here, we, again, added 10,000 or 15,000 feet. We expanded greatly the walk-in coolers for customers in produce and dairy. When you're doing in some of these units $200 million, $250 million, $300 million, you can drive some true incremental good sales by not only expanding the -- everything in terms of the traffic patterns and the ingress, egress, in and outside of the warehouse but adding some of these things like refrigeration, fresh foods. And there will still be -- continue to be a big number.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Mushkin (Analysts)】\nAll right. So you're doing more fresh remodels, fresh drives traffic. Is the focus on that fresh area on organics or just general or is it weighted towards organics, do you know?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, I think in terms of CapEx-related, it's everything. Our organics is just a piece of that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gregory Melich (Analysts)】\nYou've gone over an hour and I still have a couple of questions. So one is a follow-up on gas. What was the average gas price in the quarter versus last? And if you could give us the gallons as well, that would be great.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nThe average price in Q4 was 3.65 a year ago and 2.88 this current fourth quarter, so down 21.2%.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gregory Melich (Analysts)】\nGreat. And if that's the case, I guess, going back to gas profitability, I understand it's been a tailwind. I guess it's that incremental drop even from last quarter that's really allowed the profitability to boost up again. Is that -- are we thinking about that right?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nActually, the price was -- from a quarter ago, the price was up about $0.20 a gallon. But I think there's a little bit of a new normal. It's not just how it is year-over-year. It's when it's low, it's better from a profitability standpoint, and it's relative to competition. I mean, GasBuddy has continued to say that we're the lowest price out there nationally, and I think we're still pretty going to be very competitive. And we get a lot of good kudos from that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gregory Melich (Analysts)】\nSo basically, you can keep your competitive advantage but the $0.01 profit might be better than it used to be the way the market is.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nYes. I think when prices are low, we make more than we used to on average per gallon or per gas station, and that's good.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gregory Melich (Analysts)】\nRight. And then the second question was going back to membership fee income. I think you said it was 6% if you exclude FX.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gregory Melich (Analysts)】\nI believe, that's 100 or maybe 200 bps below the trend the last year or 2. Is that just fewer openings last year? Or I think last quarter you mentioned sign-ups for club was actually negative but it was a comparison issue. Just help us understand...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nI think overall, it's just fine. There's a little bit in Canada of the auto renewal issue when we switched over, and we'll see that again the year hence, over the next year, starting next year. That's a small piece of it. I don't think beyond that there's a whole lot there in that regard. There's always going to be the timing because membership fee dollar increases are -- we used deferred accounting for it. And so that makes it a little more squishy number, but overall, the number was in line with what we felt was pretty good.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gregory Melich (Analysts)】\nAnd with the auto renewal effect -- I guess I'll sneak a third one in. If I remember correctly, Amex is roughly 40% of the tender in the stores. So to think of the magnitude that it had in Canada when you did the changeover, what was Amex...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, there's one big difference. In Canada, the portfolio was not purchased. While I can't guarantee it would purchase, the contracts states that it should be, and we're working towards that, or Citi and Amex are working towards that end. That's a different scenario in terms of auto renewal. Up there, you basically have to re-sign people up. They have to apply for credit. They get authorized. They have to re-sign, opt in for auto renewal. I don't expect that to be an issue in the U.S. at this point.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gregory Melich (Analysts)】\nGot it. And the tender there is roughly the same as here, at 40%?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nI think it was a little less but mind you, the market share of our provider up there historically had a lower market share there relative to Canada than they do in the U.S., we have stronger market share down here.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matthew Fassler (Analysts)】\nFirst question relates to Spain, just curious on your learnings from your first Spain opening and how you expect your continental European stores to differ from your other international markets based on what you saw from that first unit.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, like any first unit with maybe the exception of Australia, which was off the charts high to start with, you learn a lot. You learn what sells and doesn't sell. I think if I recall from when we first opened in Seville 1.5 years, 2 years ago, we had less -- we had stronger non-food than we would've expected and not a strong fresh food. Usually, with a new market, you've got stronger fresh food. Given our great success in countries like Korea and Taiwan and Japan, we have to remind ourselves that Korea and Taiwan, they were not very good for several years. You start off with slower sales in most countries other than Australia when you first enter -- when we first enter the market, and that was consistent. Probably the worst economy we started was in Spain, but we're seeing some traction. Membership sign-ups are just fine, and membership renewals have been just fine. But one data point does not a story make here. But Madrid is certainly is a much bigger market than Seville. And we've got a unit, one unit coming next month, and a second one is coming, I believe, next spring, certainly, sometime in the middle of the calendar year. So that will be more telling in our view than anything we've seen so far. We continue to be very confident that we've got a good model that works and we're patient as well.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matthew Fassler (Analysts)】\nA quick second question. On the online and e-commerce piece, Instacart, I know, is a particularly prominent partnership among the ones that you've got, and it's a concept that from -- in terms of the number of retailers it's doing business with and how long that's hung in, seems to be gaining some traction. Any sense as to how that relationship has evolved, in particular, how the economics look for you relative to some of the alternatives.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, again, we're not going to disclose any specifics. We have a good working relationship with Instacart, with -- certainly, with Google Shopping Express as well, and Instacarts in more cities. And anybody you know up there that wants to buy from us, you call us.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matthew Fassler (Analysts)】\nFair enough. And then finally, I think Greg -- one element of Greg's question might not have gotten an answer was gallon comps. You talked a bit about the gas prices. But I remember when gas prices first started coming under pressure, gallon comps surged into double digits. Are you still seeing that with the prices down here today?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nI'm not sure if it's double digits, but it's certainly positive. And we generally haven't given that out, but sometimes in a moment of weakness, I share it with you guys. But the comps have continued to go in the right direction in terms of gallons.\r\nThank you, everyone. Have a good day.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you, Keela, and good morning, everyone. We welcome you to our second quarter conference call. On the call with me this morning is John Standley, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ken Martindale, Chief Executive Officer of Rite Aid Stores and President of Rite Aid Corporation; Frank Sheehy, Chief Executive Officer of EnvisionRx; and Darren Karst, Chief Financial Officer.\r\nOn today's call, John will give an overview of our second quarter results and discuss our business. Ken will give an update on some of our key initiatives. Frank will provide an update on EnvisionRx. Darren will discuss the key financial highlights and fiscal 2016 outlook, and then we will take questions.\r\nStarting with this quarter, we're reporting our business in 2 distinct segments: our Retail Pharmacy Segment consists of Rite Aid stores, RediClinic and Health Dialog, while our Pharmacy Services Segment consist of our newly acquired PBM, EnvisionRx.\r\nAs we mentioned in our release, we are providing slides related to the material we will be discussing today. These slides include annual earnings, revenue and sales guidance. These slides are provided on our website, www.riteaid.com, under the Investor Relations tab. This guidance is a point-in-time estimate, and the company expressly disclaims any current intention to update it. This conference call and the related slides will be available on the company's website until the next earnings call, unless the company withdraws them earlier, and should not be relied upon thereafter. We will not be referring to the slides directly in our remarks but hope you will find them helpful as they summarize some of the key points made on the call.\r\nFinally, I'd like to remind you that today's conference call includes certain forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are made in the context of certain risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to differ. These risks and uncertainties are described in our press release, in Item 1A of our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and other documents we file or furnish to the Securities and Exchange Commission.\r\nAlso, we'll be using a non-GAAP financial measure, adjusted EBITDA. The definition of the non-GAAP financial measure, along with the reconciliations to the related GAAP measure, are described in our press release. Also included in our slides are the non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted EBITDA gross profit and adjusted EBITDA SG&A and the reconciliations of these measures to their respective GAAP financial measures.\r\nWith these remarks, I'd now like to turn it over to John.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Matt, and thank you all for joining us to review our second quarter results for fiscal 2016. The second quarter was pivotal for Rite Aid as we finalized the acquisition of EnvisionRx and worked as a team to accelerate Rite Aid's transformation into a retail health care company. \r\nIn addition to the acquisition of EnvisionRx, we also made other significant investments in our business in the second quarter, including refinancing a portion of our debt, building RediClinics at more locations, converting additional Rite Aid stores to our wellness format and continuing the launch of our new wellness+ with Plenti coalition loyalty program. We are excited about these investments because, while they're having a short-term impact on our results, they are also absolutely critical in positioning Rite Aid for long-term growth.\r\nAdjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $346.8 million compared to $364.2 million last year. When taking into account last year's $40 million benefit related to our transition to a new drug purchasing and delivery arrangement with McKesson, adjusted EBITDA increased by $22.6 million. The increase was due to $33.2 million of adjusted EBITDA generated by Envision. This was partially offset by a decline in Retail Pharmacy gross margin due to lower pharmacy reimbursement, which was in turn partially offset by lower drug purchases cost.\r\nNet income for the quarter was $21.5 million compared to $127.8 million for last year's second quarter. The decline in net income resulted primarily from the cycling of the previously mentioned prior year benefit related to our McKesson agreement, costs related to our debt refinancing, and incremental interest expense, amortization expense and transactional costs related to the Envision acquisition. Darren will walk through these items in more detail in a few minutes. Revenue for the quarter increased by 17.5% to $7.7 billion compared to $6.5 billion for the prior year period. \r\nAs I alluded to earlier, our completion of the Envision acquisition represented a key milestone in our efforts to significantly expand our health and wellness offering and deliver unique and integrated pharmacy offerings in the health care marketplace. During the second quarter, Envision made positive contributions to our performance, delivering results that were in line with our expectations and having a strong selling season.\r\nDuring today's call, EnvisionRx CEO, Frank Sheehy, will join us to provide additional details about this segment of our business. I would just like to add that we remain very excited about the opportunities these combined entities represent, and we are in the process of evaluating the best ways to leverage all of our health care assets so that we can continue to grow as a retail health care company heading forward. We also remain highly focused on further expanding our RediClinics as we strive to deliver a higher level of care in our local communities. During the quarter, we also announced our eighth partner, Reliance ACO, based in Southeast Michigan, as we grow our Rite Aid Health Alliance program to provide comprehensive care to patients with chronic health conditions.\r\nFinally, we announced some executive appointments during the quarter designed to help Rite Aid drive growth and efficiencies as we enter a new chapter for our business. This included the promotion of Ken Martindale to the newly created position of CEO of Rite Aid Stores as he retains his role as President of Rite Aid Corporation. Ken is a proven leader with a deep understanding of our business, and we look forward to leveraging his talents to help us continue our positive momentum.\r\nWith that said, I'll now turn it over to Ken for an update on our key initiatives.\n\n---\n\nThanks, John, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call this morning. Our key initiatives continue to play an important role in providing our customers and patients with an engaging and differentiated experience that drives growth throughout the Retail Pharmacy Segment. In the second quarter, we continue to focus on educating our customers about the unique value offered by wellness+ with Plenti, which is part of the first coalition loyalty program in the United States. Through this groundbreaking loyalty offering, customers continue to enjoy the tremendous benefits of wellness+ while also having the ability to earn Plenti points and redeem them for savings at Rite Aid as well as other Plenti partners. \r\nWe continue to experience strong membership growth. Through the end of the quarter, we enrolled 17.6 million customers, and our Plenti partners had enrolled millions more throughout the coalition. In addition, more than half of all store transactions at Rite Aid now involved the wellness+ with Plenti card. \r\nWe've also been highly successful in converting our gold and silver wellness+ members to the enhanced program. More than 86% of gold members and 74% of silver members are now enrolled. Overall, we are pleased with the initial results of wellness+ with Plenti and look forward to building upon the great work that our Rite Aid team has done to successfully launch the program.\r\nOur wellness store initiative continues to drive growth and deliver a unique and engaging customer experience. During the quarter, we completed 119 wellness remodels, 3 relocations and 2 net new stores. We now have a grand total of 1,859 wellness stores, which represents 41% of our entire chain. In addition, wellness stores continue to outperform non-wellness stores in terms of same-store front-end sales and prescription count.\r\nWith flu season right around the corner, we are now aggressively promoting flu shots as we look to raise awareness about this convenient health service. Last year, our pharmacists administered a company record 3.2 million flu shots, and we look forward to working as a team to continue growing this area of our business.\r\nIn addition to Wellness Ambassador engagement with our local companies regarding flu shot clinics, we're supporting our efforts with a comprehensive marketing campaign that includes national broadcast media. We're also highly focused on leveraging the flu shot season as an opportunity to promote pharmacy services like Vaccine Central and the additional types of vaccinations that we offer on a state-by-state basis.\r\nWe continue to look for new ways to leverage our convenient retail locations and expand access to quality health care services. During the quarter, we launched a telehealth pilot by opening HealthSpot stations inside 25 Rite Aid pharmacies in Ohio. We also added one RediClinic in the Philadelphia market and another 4 RediClinics in the Seattle market. We now operate 35 Rite Aid RediClinics and 70 total clinics. We continue to experience steady growth in our clinic business. And as cough, cold and flu season approaches, we are excited to have our RediClinic and HealthSpot locations in place so that we can better serve these communities.\r\nDuring the quarter, we began accepting mobile payment such as Apple Pay, Google Wallet and the just-released Android Pay in all of our stores nationwide. We are also accepting tap and pay credit and debit cards and have the technology in place to accept a variety of mobile payment options as they come to market. This enhancement has been well received by our customers, especially those who are highly engaged in utilizing mobile technology.\r\nAs you know, we're actively working to strengthen our portfolio of private brands. In the second quarter, we introduced 2 new innovative product lines. This includes the first 150 items in our Big Win brand, which offers budget-friendly value on high-quality consumable items as well as 40 items in our new Dreamhouse brand, which offers indulgent yet affordable treats. These launches represent a significant step towards our goal of creating a world-class private brand portfolio that will deliver superior value, quality and innovation to our customers. Meanwhile, our overall private brand offering continued to deliver strong results, with penetration increasing to nearly 18.8%, more than 40 basis points higher than last year's second quarter.\r\nAnd finally, we had another strong quarter in terms of our prescription file buy program. We completed $29.2 million in file buys, and we're on pace to invest the $100 million we've allocated for this program in 2016.\r\nTo sum it up, we are pleased with the progress that we're making with our key initiatives as we look to differentiate Rite Aid as a convenient destination for health and wellness in our local communities.\r\nAt this time, I will turn it over to EnvisionRx CEO, Frank Sheehy, for additional details about the performance of EnvisionRx in our second quarter. Frank?\n\n---\n\nThank you, Ken, and thanks again to everyone for joining us on today's call. Let me first say that we are very excited to officially be part of the Rite Aid family. We believe that joining the Rite Aid team will provide us with a more competitive value proposition and help us further expand our growing base of clients and members.\r\nToday, I will provide an update on the Pharmacy Services Segment that consists of EnvisionRx financials from June 24, the date of the acquisition's closing, through the end of the fiscal quarter. We are pleased with the results, which reflect Envision's continued strong momentum in the PBM market. Revenue for this segment for the quarter was $1.1 billion, and total gross profit dollars for the quarter was $61.8 million, resulting in adjusted EBITDA for the quarter of $33.2 million.\r\nI would like to comment briefly on our current PBM selling season for the 2016 plan year. We are seeing positive response across all lines of commercial PBM business and in particular, Envision's ability to deliver on a variety of operating models, including pass-through and traditional. While already completing nearly 95% of our client renewals for 2016, I'm pleased to report Envision is having a successful year with projected wins adding approximately 700,000 net new lives, not including a still-active fourth quarter calendar 2015 pipeline.\r\nI would also like to touch briefly on our individual Medicare PDP. We have received the preliminary 2016 benchmark results from CMS. Envision Insurance will retain 14 of 34 CMS regions, which compares to 24 regions in 2015. With the annual Part D bidding process becoming increasingly price-competitive, we are maintaining a focus on acquiring low-income subsidy and chooser members at a premium and profit levels that ensure the continued delivery of attractive benefits and satisfying service. While we are decreasing in geographies and anticipate a reduction in covered lives of approximately 65,000, we still expect to have over 300,000 individual PDP lives in 2016, increased membership in the Rite Aid retail footprint and stable profitability compared to 2015.\r\nAs our core PBM business grows, added opportunities are created for our Envision mail and specialty pharmacies. With specialty drugs expected to comprise 50% of all prescription spending by 2018, our specialty pharmacy is being embraced by more clients and has seen a 37% increase in monthly prescription volume over the past 6 months. The Envision partnership with Rite Aid enables access to an increased number of limited distribution drugs and continues to help improve the value of our pharmacy offer.\r\nOverall, the Envision success in the marketplace continues to be driven by the fact that plan sponsors are looking for a PBM that will partner with them to keep drug costs down while still providing the prescription coverage and service their employees and members expect. As a full-service PBM with the operational flexibility to provide more customized client programs as well as added opportunities to further leverage our relationship with Rite Aid, we expect to see continued positive performance.\r\nAt this time, I will turn it over to Rite Aid Chief Financial Officer, Darren Karst, who will provide additional details about our financial results. Darren?\n\n---\n\nThanks, Frank, and good morning, everyone. On the call this morning, I will walk through our second quarter financial results, discuss our cash flow, liquidity, certain balance sheet items, our capital expenditure program, and finally, review our fiscal 2016 guidance.\r\nRevenue for the second quarter was $7.7 billion, which was an increase of $1.2 billion or 17.5%. Adjusted EBITDA was $346.8 million or 4.5% of revenues. Net income was $21.5 million or $0.02 per diluted share versus net income of $127.8 million or $0.13 per diluted share in last year's second quarter. The decrease in our net income was driven by several of the investments that John referenced in his opening remarks, which I will discuss in more detail in a few minutes.\r\nRetail Pharmacy Segment revenue for the quarter was $6.6 billion, which was $125 million or 1.9% higher than last year's second quarter. The increase was due to higher front-end and pharmacy sales. Overall, same-store sales increased 2.1% in the quarter. Front-end same-store sales increased by 0.3%, and pharmacy same-store sales were higher by 2.8%, which included a negative impact of approximately 223 basis points from new generic drugs. Pharmacy same-store script count was up 0.2%, which reflects a slowing of our script growth trend versus the prior year as we are cycling the benefit of last year's strong Medicaid expansion. We expect same-store script growth comparisons to continue to be difficult for the next several months as we continue to cycle last year's Medicaid expansion.\r\nRetail Pharmacy Segment adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $313.6 million or 4.7% of revenues, which was $51 million lower than last year's second quarter adjusted EBITDA of $364.2 million or 5.6% of revenues. Recall that last year's second quarter results were favorably impacted by a pharmacy margin benefit of approximately $40 million related to the transition to our drug purchasing arrangement with McKesson. Without this item in last year's results, adjusted EBITDA for the Retail Pharmacy Segment decreased by approximately $11 million, which was driven by a reduction in gross margin primarily due to lower pharmacy reimbursements versus the prior year.\r\nTotal Retail Pharmacy Segment gross profit dollars in the quarter were $34 million lower than last year's second quarter and 106 basis points lower as a percent of revenues. Adjusted EBITDA gross profit was unfavorable to last year's second quarter by $33 million or 105 basis points as a percent of revenues. Pharmacy gross profit dollars and rate were unfavorable to the prior year due to the cycling of the $40 million item from last year that I discussed earlier and lower pharmacy reimbursements, which was partially offset by purchasing efficiencies resulting from our arrangement with McKesson and higher script volumes. Front-end gross profit dollars and rate were flat to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA gross profit was also favorably impacted by lower distribution costs.\r\nRetail Pharmacy Segment SG&A expenses for the quarter were higher by $38 million or 11 basis points compared to last year's second quarter. Adjusted EBITDA SG&A dollars were higher by $17 million but 18 basis points lower as a percent of revenues compared to last year's second quarter as we were able to leverage the increase in sales through our various expense control initiatives. The increase in dollars was driven by increases in payroll and benefit costs and higher occupancy expenses. The Pharmacy Services Segment had revenues of $1.1 billion, gross profit of $62 million or 5.8% of revenues, and adjusted EBITDA of $33.2 million or 3.1% of revenues.\r\nEnvision is off to a very good start as the results were in line with our expectations. As Frank discussed earlier, the 2016 selling season results have been positive, both in new business and client renewals.\r\nNet income for the quarter was $21.5 million or $0.02 per diluted share compared to net income of $127.8 million or $0.13 per diluted share in last year's second quarter. Keep in mind our comparisons are not consistent because the current year's effective income tax rate was 43% as compared to 13% last year, which predated our reduction in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance that occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. That difference would have lowered last year's EPS by $0.04 per diluted share.\r\nAs I said earlier, the decrease in our net income was driven by several investments in our business that we made during the quarter. We incurred a $33 million loss on debt retirement in the quarter related to the early call and redemption of our 8% first lien notes. These notes were refinanced with incremental availability under our revolving credit facility, which will result in annual interest expense savings of approximately $30 million. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $17 million related to the acquisition of Envision and $9 million related to our capital spending on our retail store base over the past year. Interest expense was $14.5 million higher than last year's second quarter due to incremental interest expense of $27.6 million on our recently issued acquisition-related 6 1/8% unsecured notes, offset by savings from our revolver financing that we completed earlier in the year.\r\nNet income for the quarter was also negatively impacted by $9.6 million in acquisition-related expenses associated with our purchase of Envision. Taken together, the additional expenses related to the acquisition of Envision and our financing activity accounted for $0.05 per diluted share.\r\nOur cash flow statement for the quarter shows a net use of cash from operating activities of $26 million as compared to $122 million source of cash in last year's second quarter. Our current-year cash flow activity reflects a normal seasonal inventory build, while last year's operating cash flow benefited from a reduction in pharmacy inventory in our distribution centers as we began to transition to the new McKesson agreement.\r\nNet cash used in investing activities for the quarter was $1.9 billion, which included $1.78 billion related to the purchase of Envision. Excluding the Envision acquisition, net cash used in investing activities was $156 million versus $120 million last year.\r\nDuring the second quarter, we remodeled 119 stores, relocated 3 stores, acquired 2 stores, closed 9 stores and opened 5 clinics. At the end of the quarter, we have completed and grand reopened 1,859 wellness stores.\r\nFor the second quarter, front-end same-store sales in our wellness stores that have been remodeled in the past 24 months were approximately 350 basis points higher than our non-wellness stores and script growth in these stores was 130 basis points higher.\r\nNow let's discuss liquidity. At the end of the second quarter, we had approximately $1.2 billion of liquidity. We had $2.45 billion in borrowings outstanding under our $3.7 billion revolving credit facility and $71 million of outstanding letters of credit. Total debt, net of invested cash, was $7.4 billion. Our leverage ratio, defined as total debt less invested cash over LTM adjusted EBITDA and pro forma for a full year of Envision results, was 5.2x. Our goal is to reduce our leverage ratio to the level it was prior to the acquisition of Envision over the next couple of years.\r\nLet's now turn to our fiscal 2016 guidance. Our guidance reflects our expectations for continued reimbursement rate pressure and the benefits from the McKesson purchasing agreement as well as the anticipated benefits of our wellness remodel program, file buy acquisitions and other initiatives to grow sales and drive operational efficiencies. We expect total revenues, which include PBM revenues, to be between $30.8 billion and $31.1 billion and adjusted EBITDA to be between $1.36 billion and $1.44 billion for fiscal 2016. We expect total drugstore sales to be between $26.7 billion and $27 billion. Same-store sales are now expected to be in a range from an increase of 1.5% to 2.5%, given the cycling of last year's Medicaid expansion benefit and current sales trends. Our same-store sales guidance also includes approximately 347 basis points of anticipated negative pharmacy sales impact from new generic introductions. We expect a range of net income of $125 million to $195 million and earnings per diluted share to be in a range of $0.12 to $0.19 per diluted share. \r\nOur net income and earnings per diluted share guidance reflects incremental amortization related to the newly acquired assets of Envision. Our purchase accounting work is not yet complete, but based on our preliminary estimates, we expect amortization expense to be higher than Envision's historical amortization expense, which was the basis of our early estimates. While this incremental amortization expense is more than we initially estimated, we still expect the acquisition of Envision to be accretive in fiscal 2017 on a cash EPS basis, adjusted for deal-related amortization.\r\nOur net income and EPS guidance is net of estimated income tax expense of between $90 million and $135 million. However, we still expect our annual cash income taxes to be in a range of $10 million to $20 million as we will continue to be able to utilize our $3.1 billion federal tax NOL carryforward to offset taxes that are currently payable. The range of guidance is primarily driven by our same-store sales range and pharmacy margin expectations. \r\nOur fiscal 2016 capital expenditure plan is to spend approximately $665 million with approximately $95 million related to new and relocated stores, $235 million related to wellness remodels and approximately $100 million for script file buys. We're planning to open or acquire 18 new stores, complete 27 relocations and remodel 400 wellness stores in fiscal 2016. Our capital expenditure assumptions also includes a CapEx spend of $15 million related to EnvisionRx. We expect free cash flow to be in a range of $300 million to $400 million for the year, including the benefit of lower pharmacy inventory. We expect to close a total of 40 stores, of which the guidance includes a store lease closing provision for 10 of these stores with the balance of the stores closing upon lease expiration.\r\nThis completes my portion of the presentation, and I'd now like to turn it back to John. John?\n\n---\n\nThank you, Darren. Before we open the phone lines for questions, I'd just like to thank our nearly 90,000 associates for the great work they've done in delivering an outstanding experience for customers and patients and supporting our growth as a retail health care company. Our Rite Aid family now includes nearly 4,600 stores and wholly owned subsidiaries that offer health coaching and analytics, clinical care and a compelling suite of pharmacy benefit management services. We look forward to working as a team to fully leverage these capabilities to deliver value and innovation in the health care marketplace and drive long-term growth for Rite Aid.\r\nThat concludes our prepared remarks for this morning. We will now open the phone lines for questions.",

This included the promotion of Ken Martindale to the newly created position of CEO of Rite Aid Stores as he retains his role as President of Rite Aid Corporation. Ken is a proven leader with a deep understanding of our business, and we look forward to leveraging his talents to help us continue our positive momentum.\r\nWith that said, I'll now turn it over to Ken for an update on our key initiatives.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Kenneth Martindale (Executives)】\nThanks, John, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call this morning. Our key initiatives continue to play an important role in providing our customers and patients with an engaging and differentiated experience that drives growth throughout the Retail Pharmacy Segment. In the second quarter, we continue to focus on educating our customers about the unique value offered by wellness+ with Plenti, which is part of the first coalition loyalty program in the United States. Through this groundbreaking loyalty offering, customers continue to enjoy the tremendous benefits of wellness+ while also having the ability to earn Plenti points and redeem them for savings at Rite Aid as well as other Plenti partners. \r\nWe continue to experience strong membership growth. Through the end of the quarter, we enrolled 17.6 million customers, and our Plenti partners had enrolled millions more throughout the coalition. In addition, more than half of all store transactions at Rite Aid now involved the wellness+ with Plenti card. \r\nWe've also been highly successful in converting our gold and silver wellness+ members to the enhanced program. More than 86% of gold members and 74% of silver members are now enrolled. Overall, we are pleased with the initial results of wellness+ with Plenti and look forward to building upon the great work that our Rite Aid team has done to successfully launch the program.\r\nOur wellness store initiative continues to drive growth and deliver a unique and engaging customer experience. During the quarter, we completed 119 wellness remodels, 3 relocations and 2 net new stores. We now have a grand total of 1,859 wellness stores, which represents 41% of our entire chain. In addition, wellness stores continue to outperform non-wellness stores in terms of same-store front-end sales and prescription count.\r\nWith flu season right around the corner, we are now aggressively promoting flu shots as we look to raise awareness about this convenient health service. Last year, our pharmacists administered a company record 3.2 million flu shots, and we look forward to working as a team to continue growing this area of our business.\r\nIn addition to Wellness Ambassador engagement with our local companies regarding flu shot clinics, we're supporting our efforts with a comprehensive marketing campaign that includes national broadcast media. We're also highly focused on leveraging the flu shot season as an opportunity to promote pharmacy services like Vaccine Central and the additional types of vaccinations that we offer on a state-by-state basis.\r\nWe continue to look for new ways to leverage our convenient retail locations and expand access to quality health care services. During the quarter, we launched a telehealth pilot by opening HealthSpot stations inside 25 Rite Aid pharmacies in Ohio. We also added one RediClinic in the Philadelphia market and another 4 RediClinics in the Seattle market. We now operate 35 Rite Aid RediClinics and 70 total clinics. We continue to experience steady growth in our clinic business. And as cough, cold and flu season approaches, we are excited to have our RediClinic and HealthSpot locations in place so that we can better serve these communities.\r\nDuring the quarter, we began accepting mobile payment such as Apple Pay, Google Wallet and the just-released Android Pay in all of our stores nationwide. We are also accepting tap and pay credit and debit cards and have the technology in place to accept a variety of mobile payment options as they come to market. This enhancement has been well received by our customers, especially those who are highly engaged in utilizing mobile technology.\r\nAs you know, we're actively working to strengthen our portfolio of private brands. In the second quarter, we introduced 2 new innovative product lines. This includes the first 150 items in our Big Win brand, which offers budget-friendly value on high-quality consumable items as well as 40 items in our new Dreamhouse brand, which offers indulgent yet affordable treats. These launches represent a significant step towards our goal of creating a world-class private brand portfolio that will deliver superior value, quality and innovation to our customers. Meanwhile, our overall private brand offering continued to deliver strong results, with penetration increasing to nearly 18.8%, more than 40 basis points higher than last year's second quarter.\r\nAnd finally, we had another strong quarter in terms of our prescription file buy program. We completed $29.2 million in file buys, and we're on pace to invest the $100 million we've allocated for this program in 2016.\r\nTo sum it up, we are pleased with the progress that we're making with our key initiatives as we look to differentiate Rite Aid as a convenient destination for health and wellness in our local communities.\r\nAt this time, I will turn it over to EnvisionRx CEO, Frank Sheehy, for additional details about the performance of EnvisionRx in our second quarter. Frank?\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Frank Sheehy (Executives)】\nThank you, Ken, and thanks again to everyone for joining us on today's call. Let me first say that we are very excited to officially be part of the Rite Aid family. We believe that joining the Rite Aid team will provide us with a more competitive value proposition and help us further expand our growing base of clients and members.\r\nToday, I will provide an update on the Pharmacy Services Segment that consists of EnvisionRx financials from June 24, the date of the acquisition's closing, through the end of the fiscal quarter. We are pleased with the results, which reflect Envision's continued strong momentum in the PBM market. Revenue for this segment for the quarter was $1.1 billion, and total gross profit dollars for the quarter was $61.8 million, resulting in adjusted EBITDA for the quarter of $33.2 million.\r\nI would like to comment briefly on our current PBM selling season for the 2016 plan year. We are seeing positive response across all lines of commercial PBM business and in particular, Envision's ability to deliver on a variety of operating models, including pass-through and traditional. While already completing nearly 95% of our client renewals for 2016, I'm pleased to report Envision is having a successful year with projected wins adding approximately 700,000 net new lives, not including a still-active fourth quarter calendar 2015 pipeline.\r\nI would also like to touch briefly on our individual Medicare PDP. We have received the preliminary 2016 benchmark results from CMS. Envision Insurance will retain 14 of 34 CMS regions, which compares to 24 regions in 2015. With the annual Part D bidding process becoming increasingly price-competitive, we are maintaining a focus on acquiring low-income subsidy and chooser members at a premium and profit levels that ensure the continued delivery of attractive benefits and satisfying service. While we are decreasing in geographies and anticipate a reduction in covered lives of approximately 65,000, we still expect to have over 300,000 individual PDP lives in 2016, increased membership in the Rite Aid retail footprint and stable profitability compared to 2015.\r\nAs our core PBM business grows, added opportunities are created for our Envision mail and specialty pharmacies. With specialty drugs expected to comprise 50% of all prescription spending by 2018, our specialty pharmacy is being embraced by more clients and has seen a 37% increase in monthly prescription volume over the past 6 months. The Envision partnership with Rite Aid enables access to an increased number of limited distribution drugs and continues to help improve the value of our pharmacy offer.\r\nOverall, the Envision success in the marketplace continues to be driven by the fact that plan sponsors are looking for a PBM that will partner with them to keep drug costs down while still providing the prescription coverage and service their employees and members expect. As a full-service PBM with the operational flexibility to provide more customized client programs as well as added opportunities to further leverage our relationship with Rite Aid, we expect to see continued positive performance.\r\nAt this time, I will turn it over to Rite Aid Chief Financial Officer, Darren Karst, who will provide additional details about our financial results. Darren?\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Darren Karst (Executives)】\nThanks, Frank, and good morning, everyone. On the call this morning, I will walk through our second quarter financial results, discuss our cash flow, liquidity, certain balance sheet items, our capital expenditure program, and finally, review our fiscal 2016 guidance.\r\nRevenue for the second quarter was $7.7 billion, which was an increase of $1.2 billion or 17.5%. Adjusted EBITDA was $346.8 million or 4.5% of revenues. Net income was $21.5 million or $0.02 per diluted share versus net income of $127.8 million or $0.13 per diluted share in last year's second quarter. The decrease in our net income was driven by several of the investments that John referenced in his opening remarks, which I will discuss in more detail in a few minutes.\r\nRetail Pharmacy Segment revenue for the quarter was $6.6 billion, which was $125 million or 1.9% higher than last year's second quarter. The increase was due to higher front-end and pharmacy sales. Overall, same-store sales increased 2.1% in the quarter. Front-end same-store sales increased by 0.3%, and pharmacy same-store sales were higher by 2.8%, which included a negative impact of approximately 223 basis points from new generic drugs. Pharmacy same-store script count was up 0.2%, which reflects a slowing of our script growth trend versus the prior year as we are cycling the benefit of last year's strong Medicaid expansion. We expect same-store script growth comparisons to continue to be difficult for the next several months as we continue to cycle last year's Medicaid expansion.\r\nRetail Pharmacy Segment adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $313.6 million or 4.7% of revenues, which was $51 million lower than last year's second quarter adjusted EBITDA of $364.2 million or 5.6% of revenues. Recall that last year's second quarter results were favorably impacted by a pharmacy margin benefit of approximately $40 million related to the transition to our drug purchasing arrangement with McKesson. Without this item in last year's results, adjusted EBITDA for the Retail Pharmacy Segment decreased by approximately $11 million, which was driven by a reduction in gross margin primarily due to lower pharmacy reimbursements versus the prior year.\r\nTotal Retail Pharmacy Segment gross profit dollars in the quarter were $34 million lower than last year's second quarter and 106 basis points lower as a percent of revenues. Adjusted EBITDA gross profit was unfavorable to last year's second quarter by $33 million or 105 basis points as a percent of revenues. Pharmacy gross profit dollars and rate were unfavorable to the prior year due to the cycling of the $40 million item from last year that I discussed earlier and lower pharmacy reimbursements, which was partially offset by purchasing efficiencies resulting from our arrangement with McKesson and higher script volumes. Front-end gross profit dollars and rate were flat to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA gross profit was also favorably impacted by lower distribution costs.\r\nRetail Pharmacy Segment SG&A expenses for the quarter were higher by $38 million or 11 basis points compared to last year's second quarter. Adjusted EBITDA SG&A dollars were higher by $17 million but 18 basis points lower as a percent of revenues compared to last year's second quarter as we were able to leverage the increase in sales through our various expense control initiatives. The increase in dollars was driven by increases in payroll and benefit costs and higher occupancy expenses. The Pharmacy Services Segment had revenues of $1.1 billion, gross profit of $62 million or 5.8% of revenues, and adjusted EBITDA of $33.2 million or 3.1% of revenues.\r\nEnvision is off to a very good start as the results were in line with our expectations. As Frank discussed earlier, the 2016 selling season results have been positive, both in new business and client renewals.\r\nNet income for the quarter was $21.5 million or $0.02 per diluted share compared to net income of $127.8 million or $0.13 per diluted share in last year's second quarter. Keep in mind our comparisons are not consistent because the current year's effective income tax rate was 43% as compared to 13% last year, which predated our reduction in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance that occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. That difference would have lowered last year's EPS by $0.04 per diluted share.\r\nAs I said earlier, the decrease in our net income was driven by several investments in our business that we made during the quarter. We incurred a $33 million loss on debt retirement in the quarter related to the early call and redemption of our 8% first lien notes. These notes were refinanced with incremental availability under our revolving credit facility, which will result in annual interest expense savings of approximately $30 million. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $17 million related to the acquisition of Envision and $9 million related to our capital spending on our retail store base over the past year. Interest expense was $14.5 million higher than last year's second quarter due to incremental interest expense of $27.6 million on our recently issued acquisition-related 6 1/8% unsecured notes, offset by savings from our revolver financing that we completed earlier in the year.\r\nNet income for the quarter was also negatively impacted by $9.6 million in acquisition-related expenses associated with our purchase of Envision. Taken together, the additional expenses related to the acquisition of Envision and our financing activity accounted for $0.05 per diluted share.\r\nOur cash flow statement for the quarter shows a net use of cash from operating activities of $26 million as compared to $122 million source of cash in last year's second quarter. Our current-year cash flow activity reflects a normal seasonal inventory build, while last year's operating cash flow benefited from a reduction in pharmacy inventory in our distribution centers as we began to transition to the new McKesson agreement.\r\nNet cash used in investing activities for the quarter was $1.9 billion, which included $1.78 billion related to the purchase of Envision. Excluding the Envision acquisition, net cash used in investing activities was $156 million versus $120 million last year.\r\nDuring the second quarter, we remodeled 119 stores, relocated 3 stores, acquired 2 stores, closed 9 stores and opened 5 clinics. At the end of the quarter, we have completed and grand reopened 1,859 wellness stores.\r\nFor the second quarter, front-end same-store sales in our wellness stores that have been remodeled in the past 24 months were approximately 350 basis points higher than our non-wellness stores and script growth in these stores was 130 basis points higher.\r\nNow let's discuss liquidity. At the end of the second quarter, we had approximately $1.2 billion of liquidity. We had $2.45 billion in borrowings outstanding under our $3.7 billion revolving credit facility and $71 million of outstanding letters of credit. Total debt, net of invested cash, was $7.4 billion. Our leverage ratio, defined as total debt less invested cash over LTM adjusted EBITDA and pro forma for a full year of Envision results, was 5.2x. Our goal is to reduce our leverage ratio to the level it was prior to the acquisition of Envision over the next couple of years.\r\nLet's now turn to our fiscal 2016 guidance. Our guidance reflects our expectations for continued reimbursement rate pressure and the benefits from the McKesson purchasing agreement as well as the anticipated benefits of our wellness remodel program, file buy acquisitions and other initiatives to grow sales and drive operational efficiencies. We expect total revenues, which include PBM revenues, to be between $30.8 billion and $31.1 billion and adjusted EBITDA to be between $1.36 billion and $1.44 billion for fiscal 2016. We expect total drugstore sales to be between $26.7 billion and $27 billion. Same-store sales are now expected to be in a range from an increase of 1.5% to 2.5%, given the cycling of last year's Medicaid expansion benefit and current sales trends. Our same-store sales guidance also includes approximately 347 basis points of anticipated negative pharmacy sales impact from new generic introductions. We expect a range of net income of $125 million to $195 million and earnings per diluted share to be in a range of $0.12 to $0.19 per diluted share. \r\nOur net income and earnings per diluted share guidance reflects incremental amortization related to the newly acquired assets of Envision. Our purchase accounting work is not yet complete, but based on our preliminary estimates, we expect amortization expense to be higher than Envision's historical amortization expense, which was the basis of our early estimates. While this incremental amortization expense is more than we initially estimated, we still expect the acquisition of Envision to be accretive in fiscal 2017 on a cash EPS basis, adjusted for deal-related amortization.\r\nOur net income and EPS guidance is net of estimated income tax expense of between $90 million and $135 million. However, we still expect our annual cash income taxes to be in a range of $10 million to $20 million as we will continue to be able to utilize our $3.1 billion federal tax NOL carryforward to offset taxes that are currently payable. The range of guidance is primarily driven by our same-store sales range and pharmacy margin expectations. \r\nOur fiscal 2016 capital expenditure plan is to spend approximately $665 million with approximately $95 million related to new and relocated stores, $235 million related to wellness remodels and approximately $100 million for script file buys. We're planning to open or acquire 18 new stores, complete 27 relocations and remodel 400 wellness stores in fiscal 2016. Our capital expenditure assumptions also includes a CapEx spend of $15 million related to EnvisionRx. We expect free cash flow to be in a range of $300 million to $400 million for the year, including the benefit of lower pharmacy inventory. We expect to close a total of 40 stores, of which the guidance includes a store lease closing provision for 10 of these stores with the balance of the stores closing upon lease expiration.\r\nThis completes my portion of the presentation, and I'd now like to turn it back to John. John?\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: John Standley (Executives)】\nThank you, Darren. Before we open the phone lines for questions, I'd just like to thank our nearly 90,000 associates for the great work they've done in delivering an outstanding experience for customers and patients and supporting our growth as a retail health care company. Our Rite Aid family now includes nearly 4,600 stores and wholly owned subsidiaries that offer health coaching and analytics, clinical care and a compelling suite of pharmacy benefit management services. We look forward to working as a team to fully leverage these capabilities to deliver value and innovation in the health care marketplace and drive long-term growth for Rite Aid.\r\nThat concludes our prepared remarks for this morning. We will now open the phone lines for questions.",
      "transcript_text3": "I guess, as we think about guidance, the EBITDA outlook looks largely unchanged. Maybe could you talk about whether there has been any change to your expectations, specifically about the contribution from Envision? And I guess, with that, I'm just curious, on the core business, any change to your outlook on the EBITDA for the balance of the year?\n\n---\n\nI think we're pretty much in line with our original expectations. I mean, obviously, the top line has been a little tougher than we anticipated coming into the year. I think reimbursement rates have lined up with our expectations so far, we've done a very good job on the purchasing side, and that's really helping us, I think, weather a little bit of our script count challenge at the moment. And we've been pretty good on the SG&A so far. So I think that's really what's kind of driven our ability to sort of a hang in there on EBITDA with a little bit tougher top line.\n\n---\n\nGot it. And I guess just to follow up. Moderating generic inflation, obviously a big focus across the supply chain. And I recall last year, the greater-than-expected inflation created some issues for you guys earlier in the fiscal year last year. Can you just remind us what the impact is to the business as we see generic inflation moderating?\n\n---\n\nWell, I mean, I think we tend to look at it more directly on our ability to purchase drugs at lower costs or whether we have a cost increase that we have to absorb. So I think we, again, had a pretty good year on the purchasing side, which is helping us on the pharmacy margin. And our expectation is that we're going to continue to make progress for the remainder of the year. I don't think I answered your question very well, but that's kind of the way we think about it.\n\n---\n\nI just want to go back to the same-store sales, obviously cycling through Medicaid expansion. But either John or Ken or Darren, can you maybe just give us some indication as to what changed? Is it just that it dropped off more quickly than you anticipated? Did you have something in your expectations for conversion of scripts from Envision moving into your stores in that initial guidance that you gave us?\n\n---\n\nI think it's-- I think that's a longer-term opportunity for us, Lisa. That's going to take some time for us to build those kind of programs and put them in the marketplace. I mean, as it relates to Envision, we're really focused on organic growth. And I got tell you, Frank and his team are really delivering on that front right out of the gate. We're really excited about the progress they've made. I mean, I think as I look at our business, we're-- I mean, I think one area we knew we were going to be a little bit challenged coming into the year was on the Medicare side. We are not participating in a large number of those preferred Part D networks. I think the area that maybe surprised us a little bit more right now is we are little bit soft in our commercial business. I think that's a trend that kind of started in the first quarter that we talked about. That continues today. And that's probably where I see the biggest difference right now. Probably, I'll -- there's probably, out of the gate, maybe a touch slower on flu and cough and cold in both the front end and the pharmacy, but that'll probably pick up as we go here. So some of that probably comes back over time.\n\n---\n\nAnd so do you feel like that the new same-store sale guidance that you're giving, which is down about 150 basis points at the midpoint, is conservative? Or do you feel like that's something that...\n\n---\n\nWe do our best to -- based on the information, that we make it as accurate as we can.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then just a follow-up question. Frank, I'm happy to talk about PBM, and just had a question here. As we look at the 700,000 net new lives, is there a way that you can either talk to us about how many scripts you currently have, expectation around script growth that you'll see going along with these 700,000 lives? Are they commercial? Are they managed care? I mean, how do we think about those incremental lives that you're adding to the book?\n\n---\n\nSure. No, we're really pleased because the growth has come across multiple segments. We've had growth in managed care plans, including managed Medicare plans as well as in mid-market, small business growth. And the growth has come across both our historical Envision transparent pass-through PBM as well as through our traditional spread model PBM, MedTrak. So we're seeing growth across all the various market segments, and we're really pleased with the organic growth, as John mentioned.\n\n---\n\nIs script count a number that you'll think about giving us going forward? I noticed that today you didn't talk at all about scripts but rather gave us revenue, gross profit and EBITDA.\n\n---\n\nWe'll look at it, Lisa.\n\n---\n\nMaybe to start out, I know you started to touch on it on -- as it relates to reimbursement. There's obviously been a lot of noise in the industry from Walmart, Kroger and others. And so obviously, different players have different timing of contract renewals and the like. But what else has sort of developed this year that you've seen in the industry, and as you've talked to kind of your peers and looked at sort of how things have played out, what's sort of been different, I guess, than maybe a 6-months-ago assumption? And as you think about now with Envision, how that sort of maybe can give you some relief on some of those items and with some of the programs you're running? And as you better understood the PBM business model as a whole, has that made you smarter relative to kind of the reimbursement discussion? And how do you see that manifesting itself?\n\n---\n\nSo there's a lot in that one, I guess. But this is -- and I think it's one of the reasons we kind of started guidance where we did for the year. This is going to be a tough reimbursement rate year for us. And I think we talked about that pretty openly as we established that guidance. But it is in line with our expectations so far. So it is -- put pressure on our earnings, but it is what we expected, and we try to manage our business accordingly. It is a very competitive marketplace. I mean, I think the Part D marketplace probably continues to drive the whole marketplace as those rates continue to come down over time. They seem to bleed into the commercial space, and I think that's kind of the leader of the decline in rates over time here. We also continue to see what we think is growth in limited networks on the commercial side. We think those are starting to gain more traction. Still not a predominantly large piece of our commercial business, but a growing piece of our commercial business. So I think those are some dynamics that continue to sort of drive rates in a negative direction. I'm not sure what was the rest of the -- what else you want...\n\n---\n\nAnd now that you have sort of the PBM asset in house, you get to better understand how the other side of the trade looks at it. How has that made you smarter as you think about your next set of negotiations and the like?\n\n---\n\nYes, I don't know if I can point to anything specific. I mean we do have some firewalls in place to prevent any kind of particulars about rates and those kinds of things moving back and forth. I mean, I think conceptually, though, we are just getting a better understanding overall of the PBM industry. And our focus has been -- and continues to be a great partner. I mean, we want to work with our PBM partners who are essentially our customers at the end of the day. So we want to deliver great service to them. We want to be a differentiator in the marketplace. And I think that's how we need to continue to go to market. And as we learn more about Envision and its business, we understand how important that is, that execution at the retail level is, to really help Envision and other PBMs be successful in what they're trying to do.\n\n---\n\nThat makes sense. And maybe strategically, obviously, there's been a lot of change in the market the last probably 36 months. As you think about your priorities, obviously, you're executing against Envision right now. But you saw what CVS did with Target. There's a lot of opportunities on the PBM side to roll up. I think you did a small deal in the MedTrak side in the quarter. How do you think about sort of from a strategic set perspective, how you're prioritizing where you're going to push the asset next and where capital's going to go from that -- from an M&A standpoint.\n\n---\n\nSure. I mean, I think our -- we'd love to have the opportunity to continue to grow our store network, obviously. So we are constantly reviewing opportunities that exist there, trying to figure out if anything makes sense for us. We're looking very carefully with Frank at the kinds of opportunities that make sense for his business, but we do have to live within the confines of our capital structure. So I don't -- those are the constraints with which we have to live by. So specialty is also kind of interesting to us. We picked up a nice -- a really nice specialty business here with Envision, but I think there might be some opportunity over time to add some capabilities and depth to that business that could be exciting for us.\n\n---\n\nWe've all seen the generic drug price slow down, but has it provided much of a margin opportunity for you guys? Wouldn't seem that it has. And are we seeing the pace of change in reimbursement kind of catch up with underlying cost changes? Is that accelerating? And I guess, is there way to capitalize on the price of the underlying cost of goods? Or is that kind of eroding?\n\n---\n\nThere is. I mean, as costs on the generic side in particular, as costs comes down, because costs seems to never go down on the brand side. But as costs go down on the generic side, that's clearly beneficial to us, the way the vast majority of our PBM contracts are constructed. So that is good for us. However, as you're standing, what tends to happen is you get a contract renewal date. I think rates have gone down for the last 15 years because then those cost savings tend to get into -- pass through to ultimately the clients and customers in the marketplace. So that's kind of how the business works, and that's the cycle of life, if you will, on the generic side of the business.\n\n---\n\nAnd then maybe just a quick follow-up is, can you give us any color on how rate discussions for calendar '16 are starting to hold up?\n\n---\n\nI mean, I think we said for calendar '16, we're -- it's early, but we're optimistic that it may not be quite as deep as this year was. But we still have a lot of work to do to probably have a full answer on that.\n\n---\n\nSo on the PBM, 2 things. Maybe can you talk about the dialogue you're having with potential health care, health plan clients? And how fruitful you think that might be -- when that might start to pay off? And then if you look at the 700,000 net lives, is there a way to put a revenue number around that? Could that be $500 million to $750 million of net revenue or something in that ballpark?\n\n---\n\nSure. Well, I think, first, I think our conversations with health plans have already started to bear some fruit. And actually, the growth that we've talked about is made up by more than 50% by health plan wins. I think the health plan market is really looking for an alternative with a PBM that can provide high-touch service to its members, a nimble flexible platform that helps them to compete in their marketplace, and a business model that can align incentives in how we work with them, whether it's to structure a retail network or how it's to design their formulary. So we're already resonating in the marketplace with the message that we have there and have had some nice success this year. And we continue to think regional health plans is a key growth opportunity for Envision going forward. To the second part of your question about the revenue, we'd expect the revenue on the business that has been won for 2015 going into 2016 to be north of the $700 million that you mentioned.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then secondly for John, more strategically. I mean, it makes sense that some of the weakness here in comp scripts, right, and the front end, it looks transitory. But when you guys sit back and question, is it completely transitory? Is it something else in the market that might be changing? I don't know if it's -- if you think about real estate. But how do you sort of get comfortable that it's all transitory and 6, 7 months from now, we're going to be back kind of closer to where we were a year ago?\n\n---\n\nWell, I mean, we're obviously putting our company through a lot of change. So we got a lot going on here that we're kind of working way through. I mean, on the front end, I feel very confident that as Plenti continue to gain traction, and we continue to renovate stores and do the things that we do, that, that business will, I think, will recover over time from some of what we've got going on right now. On the pharmacy side, I do think that it's a balancing act that we do between where we want to be with reimbursement rates and how many different kinds of more aggressive networks we want to be in. And we're probably paying a little bit of a price for some of our conscious decisions to manage margin a little bit here. And I think that's a balancing act that we continue to look at and work our way through. And so I think that's a dynamic we've got to continue to manage.\n\n---\n\nJohn, could you provide a little bit of an update on what you're seeing on the remodel side from a comp perspective, traffic? Has it changed much at all? Just want to know that's performing relative to expectations.\n\n---\n\nI'm going to let somebody else answer your question. Ken?\n\n---\n\nIt's been pretty consistent with what we've seen over the last couple of years. We're still seeing very good traction on the front end right out of the gates once we get the remodel done, and the scripts tend to follow behind that. And consumer reaction seems to be very good, and we're pretty happy with the results. So I would say it's very consistent with what we've seen over the last couple of years.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then, John, you mentioned not participating in preferred networks as one of the headwinds here. As you think about going into next year, how's your thought process there evolving? How much of an opportunity is it for you? Because you don't have a national footprint from a store face so can you be a bigger participant there, if you want to be?\n\n---\n\nI think if we wanted to be, I think we could. I mean, there are still some networks that are just never offered to us. That's the way the industry works. But there are, I think, there are some others that we have -- we do have strong regional presence in many markets where I think it's really -- it's a bit of a trade-off between rate and access that we've got to continue to grapple with.\n\n---\n\nAnd just last question then. There's obviously been a lot of question about reimbursement rates, and we are hearing it from other players in the industry. I don't think anybody's really asked the question as to why has this year been tougher. I know every year it's kind of tough, but what is it about the current year that's making it tougher it seems like for everyone?\n\n---\n\nI think for us, what we -- I think what we've talked about a little bit is -- and I think someone kind of talked about it earlier, we saw a lot of benefit coming through the large generic wave the prior couple of years. And it just takes a while for rates in the marketplace to catch up to that. And I think that's what we've been kind of digesting here. And that trickles into this year.\n\n---\n\nDoes scale at all help with -- that often does, right?\n\n---\n\nThat does. I mean, I think what our arrangement, I think, with McKesson has clearly helped us drive down cost and helped us gain some efficiency in our distribution model.\n\n---\n\nWhat about scale at retail, though?\n\n---\n\nI think scale at retail, where it's probably maybe most significant -- because I think on the purchasing side, on the drug side, I think we have scale. I mean, if you took how we purchase drugs and sort of compared it, I think, to maybe where our 2 largest competitors are when you combine our volume with everything that McKesson's doing globally, I think we stack up pretty nicely. And we should be competitive on that front, I think, going forward. Where we're a little weak is we have holes in the network. So where we would maybe be a little bit stronger maybe would be if we had a more complete store network, which is something we continue to try and sort of figure out a little bit.\n\n---\n\nSo I had a couple on the PBM, too. Actually, you guys have kind of already answered as far as the revenues for next year. But the -- I guess, when you think about the $700 million plus of revenue, that implies mid-teens revenue growth just from those new lives. And then presumably, you'll get some organic revenue growth on the base book and from specialty as well. So I guess, just to kind of frame all that, should we assume potentially 20% plus type growth within that PBM organically for next year and really for the next few years? Is that sort of the right ballpark to think about that asset?\n\n---\n\nWe're -- I think we're a little early to give you a long-term guidance on it. But I think we're -- I think some of the points you make are good ones. We're having a great selling season. We're excited to continue to work with the specialty asset, the specialty company that's inside of Envision. So we have some great opportunity here, but I don't think we're ready to peg some numbers for you yet.\n\n---\n\nWith some of the additional biotech drugs coming out, the PCSK9 inhibitors, et cetera, does the specialty asset within Envision have a leverage to some of those new drugs and the PCSK9 in particular?\n\n---\n\nYes, we expect that we will have access to those drugs going forward. Of course, it's going to be key on how we help our clients manage expenses as it relates to those drugs. So while those drugs could make sense, certainly for some patients, for some members, we want to make sure we have the appropriate processes in place to make sure they're getting to the right members so not to drive up the cost of our plan sponsors.\n\n---\n\nWhen you guys look at getting leverage -- back to your earlier targets of where you were prior to the acquisition, I mean, do you feel that, that keeps you out of the markets to add kind of the bolt-ons or perhaps larger acquisitions? Or do you feel that the debt markets [indiscernible] are still there and supportive of your structure?\n\n---\n\nYes, I mean, again, I think we are going to work within that -- the confines of the capital structure that we have. We think we made the right decision to acquire EnvisionRx. It was the right way to deploy the capital that we had available. And so our focus will be on our core -- our 2 core businesses now to invest in things that are -- fit onto that. But it's clearly going to be smaller within the confines of our capital structure.\n\n---\n\nAnd when we look at the second half of the year, a number of other guys are talking about benefiting from lower gasoline prices, stronger, healthier consumer heading into the holidays. Kind of what are you seeing differently in terms of those front-end sales?\n\n---\n\nI don't know that we're seeing a whole lot of impact. A lot of our business is convenient business. People live close to our boxes. And so I think the consumer, hopefully, with the lower gas prices, will be a little more optimistic in spending in general. But I don't know that we see a big bump from lower gas prices. Overall, the front end's been fairly consistent, and we're looking forward to a reasonably good holiday season right now.\n\n---\n\nFirst, I wanted to talk -- ask about the PBM side. I think I saw some news come across. Envision made a couple of small acquisitions in the last couple of months. Did that have any benefit to the current quarter? Is that something we'll see a little bit later? And if you can maybe help size some of that contribution.\n\n---\n\nYes, I don't think it was significant for the current quarter. They were fairly small bolt-ons. The one thing I think that was very important about it is it added some geographic scope to us. It's a lot of East Coast business. Frank, you may have...\n\n---\n\nYes, they were -- again, I don't think they're significant, certainly not immediately in size, but they do give us a presence on the East Coast for our MedTrak organization. And as we look to expand MedTrak, which we do think is a key part of our growth strategy to have the traditional model expanding into a national model, I think that will pay significant long-term dividends for us. And that was the basis behind these small acquisitions.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Were they -- was any contribution from them included in that sort of 700,000 net new lives that you mentioned earlier?\n\n---\n\nNo, that would be -- those acquisitions would be additive to the 700,000 lives that I mentioned earlier.\n\n---\n\nOkay, great. And then I just had a question back about sort of the new same-store sales guidance. Just kind of tying together some of the comments you made to previous questions, I mean, it sounds like some of this is really less market-related and more how you want to manage sort of promotion and margin versus traffic. Is that the right -- am I understanding that correctly?\n\n---\n\nI think that's a little bit of an impact on the pharmacy side. I mean, Ken, on the front end, it's...\n\n---\n\nYes, I don't think that's probably the case on the front end. Yes, I would say that promotional environment's pretty similar to what it's been. And our position promotionally is pretty similar to how it's been. We're still seeing some maturation with Plenti as customers get used to it, and we're looking forward to Plenti paying some pretty good dividends as customers do get more accustomed to how it works.\n\n---\n\nWith Plenti, is it an issue where if I'm a Plenti member but from one of the partner companies, is it that I'm not fully aware yet of how the Rite Aid reward program works, and is -- so is that just an education process to get them to understand sort of how the sort of the purchasing level breaks, that they get better discounts?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think they probably are not going to really understand that until they start shopping with us because Plenti doesn't educate anybody on our wellness+ tier structure. So I think initially, it's more just getting people used to the concept of a coalition loyalty program. Because in the United States, people really aren't used to earning points in multiple places and being able to redeem them. So there's that education, and we are seeing some new customers come in that signed up at our partner locations. And we think that over time, we'll be able to convert those folks, and that there will be some education. But right now, it's really just getting people used to how to shop with a coalition loyalty program.\n\n---\n\nOkay, great. And sorry, my last question for Darren. I think you had mentioned earlier there was -- you were accelerating sort of a deal-related amortization. Can you go over those comments again? And why would that be the case?\n\n---\n\nYes, well, it's early. So we're kind of working through purchase accounting for the transaction right now. It looks like the valuation of our customer relationships are going to be a little bit higher than what they had been for Envision. And the amortization is going to be a little more accelerated. That's -- so it's creating a little more amortization expense -- deal amortization expense.\n\n---\n\nCan you hear me?\n\n---\n\nYes, we can now.\n\n---\n\nSorry about that. I just switched phones. One is just a housekeeping item. You mentioned the revolver draw. Could I just get the availability on it?\n\n---\n\nYes, I believe it's....\n\n---\n\nIt is $1.2 billion.\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then have you provided -- your guidance for the year includes Envision for the portion of the year, it was included -- pro forma EBITDA as if it were included for the full year, what we would be looking at?\n\n---\n\nWe -- in the slides we put out, we had a pro forma leverage calculation, Carla. So there, we used $155 million, which is the midpoint of the $150 million to $160 million that we said we do for '15 when we announced the deal.\n\n---\n\n[indiscernible]\n\n---\n\n[indiscernible] you want that to calculate the leverage, correct?\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nExactly.\n\n---\n\nFor Ken, could you maybe talk about how you're doing on that transition to Core-Mark for distribution of tobacco and some of those 5 front-end categories? Is it helping on cost? Is it helping on in-stock position? Maybe just a little feedback on how the stores are transitioning with that.\n\n---\n\nI think they're doing pretty well, Mark. Obviously, when you make a major transition like that, there's a few bumps on the road, and we've experienced a few of those. But I think overall, it's gone well. It helps us because it gives them some scale and makes it a little easier for them to visit our stores more frequently and it drops some of those costs for us on distribution. So overall, I think it's been good. It takes some inventory out of our system, and we're pleased with the progress that we've made so far.\n\n---\n\nOkay, does that take any of the heat off your new distribution facility because you're not going be doing tobacco there?\n\n---\n\nNot really. I mean, tobacco's a fairly easy category to handle. But it simplifies things a little bit because we don't have to worry about stamps and the cigarettes and everything. So it really doesn't -- it doesn't really apply to that DC. It was really more of an overall network opportunity for us to leverage them and give them a little more volume.\n\n---\n\nAnd for you, is it more of a \"cost of goods sold\" savings? Or are you doing better on in-stock?\n\n---\n\nIt helps our distribution cost substantially, and it should help our in-stocks. But it's more really helping us on the supply chain side, honestly.\n\n---\n\nWant to thank everybody for calling in today. Appreciate your time and have a good day.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Robert Jones (Analysts)】\nI guess, as we think about guidance, the EBITDA outlook looks largely unchanged. Maybe could you talk about whether there has been any change to your expectations, specifically about the contribution from Envision? And I guess, with that, I'm just curious, on the core business, any change to your outlook on the EBITDA for the balance of the year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nI think we're pretty much in line with our original expectations. I mean, obviously, the top line has been a little tougher than we anticipated coming into the year. I think reimbursement rates have lined up with our expectations so far, we've done a very good job on the purchasing side, and that's really helping us, I think, weather a little bit of our script count challenge at the moment. And we've been pretty good on the SG&A so far. So I think that's really what's kind of driven our ability to sort of a hang in there on EBITDA with a little bit tougher top line.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Jones (Analysts)】\nGot it. And I guess just to follow up. Moderating generic inflation, obviously a big focus across the supply chain. And I recall last year, the greater-than-expected inflation created some issues for you guys earlier in the fiscal year last year. Can you just remind us what the impact is to the business as we see generic inflation moderating?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nWell, I mean, I think we tend to look at it more directly on our ability to purchase drugs at lower costs or whether we have a cost increase that we have to absorb. So I think we, again, had a pretty good year on the purchasing side, which is helping us on the pharmacy margin. And our expectation is that we're going to continue to make progress for the remainder of the year. I don't think I answered your question very well, but that's kind of the way we think about it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Lisa Gill (Analysts)】\nI just want to go back to the same-store sales, obviously cycling through Medicaid expansion. But either John or Ken or Darren, can you maybe just give us some indication as to what changed? Is it just that it dropped off more quickly than you anticipated? Did you have something in your expectations for conversion of scripts from Envision moving into your stores in that initial guidance that you gave us?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nI think it's-- I think that's a longer-term opportunity for us, Lisa. That's going to take some time for us to build those kind of programs and put them in the marketplace. I mean, as it relates to Envision, we're really focused on organic growth. And I got tell you, Frank and his team are really delivering on that front right out of the gate. We're really excited about the progress they've made. I mean, I think as I look at our business, we're-- I mean, I think one area we knew we were going to be a little bit challenged coming into the year was on the Medicare side. We are not participating in a large number of those preferred Part D networks. I think the area that maybe surprised us a little bit more right now is we are little bit soft in our commercial business. I think that's a trend that kind of started in the first quarter that we talked about. That continues today. And that's probably where I see the biggest difference right now. Probably, I'll -- there's probably, out of the gate, maybe a touch slower on flu and cough and cold in both the front end and the pharmacy, but that'll probably pick up as we go here. So some of that probably comes back over time.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Lisa Gill (Analysts)】\nAnd so do you feel like that the new same-store sale guidance that you're giving, which is down about 150 basis points at the midpoint, is conservative? Or do you feel like that's something that...\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nWe do our best to -- based on the information, that we make it as accurate as we can.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Lisa Gill (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then just a follow-up question. Frank, I'm happy to talk about PBM, and just had a question here. As we look at the 700,000 net new lives, is there a way that you can either talk to us about how many scripts you currently have, expectation around script growth that you'll see going along with these 700,000 lives? Are they commercial? Are they managed care? I mean, how do we think about those incremental lives that you're adding to the book?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Sheehy (Executives)】\nSure. No, we're really pleased because the growth has come across multiple segments. We've had growth in managed care plans, including managed Medicare plans as well as in mid-market, small business growth. And the growth has come across both our historical Envision transparent pass-through PBM as well as through our traditional spread model PBM, MedTrak. So we're seeing growth across all the various market segments, and we're really pleased with the organic growth, as John mentioned.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Lisa Gill (Analysts)】\nIs script count a number that you'll think about giving us going forward? I noticed that today you didn't talk at all about scripts but rather gave us revenue, gross profit and EBITDA.\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nWe'll look at it, Lisa.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ross Muken (Analysts)】\nMaybe to start out, I know you started to touch on it on -- as it relates to reimbursement. There's obviously been a lot of noise in the industry from Walmart, Kroger and others. And so obviously, different players have different timing of contract renewals and the like. But what else has sort of developed this year that you've seen in the industry, and as you've talked to kind of your peers and looked at sort of how things have played out, what's sort of been different, I guess, than maybe a 6-months-ago assumption? And as you think about now with Envision, how that sort of maybe can give you some relief on some of those items and with some of the programs you're running? And as you better understood the PBM business model as a whole, has that made you smarter relative to kind of the reimbursement discussion? And how do you see that manifesting itself?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nSo there's a lot in that one, I guess. But this is -- and I think it's one of the reasons we kind of started guidance where we did for the year. This is going to be a tough reimbursement rate year for us. And I think we talked about that pretty openly as we established that guidance. But it is in line with our expectations so far. So it is -- put pressure on our earnings, but it is what we expected, and we try to manage our business accordingly. It is a very competitive marketplace. I mean, I think the Part D marketplace probably continues to drive the whole marketplace as those rates continue to come down over time. They seem to bleed into the commercial space, and I think that's kind of the leader of the decline in rates over time here. We also continue to see what we think is growth in limited networks on the commercial side. We think those are starting to gain more traction. Still not a predominantly large piece of our commercial business, but a growing piece of our commercial business. So I think those are some dynamics that continue to sort of drive rates in a negative direction. I'm not sure what was the rest of the -- what else you want...\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ross Muken (Analysts)】\nAnd now that you have sort of the PBM asset in house, you get to better understand how the other side of the trade looks at it. How has that made you smarter as you think about your next set of negotiations and the like?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nYes, I don't know if I can point to anything specific. I mean we do have some firewalls in place to prevent any kind of particulars about rates and those kinds of things moving back and forth. I mean, I think conceptually, though, we are just getting a better understanding overall of the PBM industry. And our focus has been -- and continues to be a great partner. I mean, we want to work with our PBM partners who are essentially our customers at the end of the day. So we want to deliver great service to them. We want to be a differentiator in the marketplace. And I think that's how we need to continue to go to market. And as we learn more about Envision and its business, we understand how important that is, that execution at the retail level is, to really help Envision and other PBMs be successful in what they're trying to do.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ross Muken (Analysts)】\nThat makes sense. And maybe strategically, obviously, there's been a lot of change in the market the last probably 36 months. As you think about your priorities, obviously, you're executing against Envision right now. But you saw what CVS did with Target. There's a lot of opportunities on the PBM side to roll up. I think you did a small deal in the MedTrak side in the quarter. How do you think about sort of from a strategic set perspective, how you're prioritizing where you're going to push the asset next and where capital's going to go from that -- from an M&A standpoint.\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nSure. I mean, I think our -- we'd love to have the opportunity to continue to grow our store network, obviously. So we are constantly reviewing opportunities that exist there, trying to figure out if anything makes sense for us. We're looking very carefully with Frank at the kinds of opportunities that make sense for his business, but we do have to live within the confines of our capital structure. So I don't -- those are the constraints with which we have to live by. So specialty is also kind of interesting to us. We picked up a nice -- a really nice specialty business here with Envision, but I think there might be some opportunity over time to add some capabilities and depth to that business that could be exciting for us.\n\n---\n\n【質問: George Hill (Analysts)】\nWe've all seen the generic drug price slow down, but has it provided much of a margin opportunity for you guys? Wouldn't seem that it has. And are we seeing the pace of change in reimbursement kind of catch up with underlying cost changes? Is that accelerating? And I guess, is there way to capitalize on the price of the underlying cost of goods? Or is that kind of eroding?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nThere is. I mean, as costs on the generic side in particular, as costs comes down, because costs seems to never go down on the brand side. But as costs go down on the generic side, that's clearly beneficial to us, the way the vast majority of our PBM contracts are constructed. So that is good for us. However, as you're standing, what tends to happen is you get a contract renewal date. I think rates have gone down for the last 15 years because then those cost savings tend to get into -- pass through to ultimately the clients and customers in the marketplace. So that's kind of how the business works, and that's the cycle of life, if you will, on the generic side of the business.\n\n---\n\n【質問: George Hill (Analysts)】\nAnd then maybe just a quick follow-up is, can you give us any color on how rate discussions for calendar '16 are starting to hold up?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nI mean, I think we said for calendar '16, we're -- it's early, but we're optimistic that it may not be quite as deep as this year was. But we still have a lot of work to do to probably have a full answer on that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Heinbockel (Analysts)】\nSo on the PBM, 2 things. Maybe can you talk about the dialogue you're having with potential health care, health plan clients? And how fruitful you think that might be -- when that might start to pay off? And then if you look at the 700,000 net lives, is there a way to put a revenue number around that? Could that be $500 million to $750 million of net revenue or something in that ballpark?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Sheehy (Executives)】\nSure. Well, I think, first, I think our conversations with health plans have already started to bear some fruit. And actually, the growth that we've talked about is made up by more than 50% by health plan wins. I think the health plan market is really looking for an alternative with a PBM that can provide high-touch service to its members, a nimble flexible platform that helps them to compete in their marketplace, and a business model that can align incentives in how we work with them, whether it's to structure a retail network or how it's to design their formulary. So we're already resonating in the marketplace with the message that we have there and have had some nice success this year. And we continue to think regional health plans is a key growth opportunity for Envision going forward. To the second part of your question about the revenue, we'd expect the revenue on the business that has been won for 2015 going into 2016 to be north of the $700 million that you mentioned.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Heinbockel (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then secondly for John, more strategically. I mean, it makes sense that some of the weakness here in comp scripts, right, and the front end, it looks transitory. But when you guys sit back and question, is it completely transitory? Is it something else in the market that might be changing? I don't know if it's -- if you think about real estate. But how do you sort of get comfortable that it's all transitory and 6, 7 months from now, we're going to be back kind of closer to where we were a year ago?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nWell, I mean, we're obviously putting our company through a lot of change. So we got a lot going on here that we're kind of working way through. I mean, on the front end, I feel very confident that as Plenti continue to gain traction, and we continue to renovate stores and do the things that we do, that, that business will, I think, will recover over time from some of what we've got going on right now. On the pharmacy side, I do think that it's a balancing act that we do between where we want to be with reimbursement rates and how many different kinds of more aggressive networks we want to be in. And we're probably paying a little bit of a price for some of our conscious decisions to manage margin a little bit here. And I think that's a balancing act that we continue to look at and work our way through. And so I think that's a dynamic we've got to continue to manage.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Edward Kelly (Analysts)】\nJohn, could you provide a little bit of an update on what you're seeing on the remodel side from a comp perspective, traffic? Has it changed much at all? Just want to know that's performing relative to expectations.\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nI'm going to let somebody else answer your question. Ken?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kenneth Martindale (Executives)】\nIt's been pretty consistent with what we've seen over the last couple of years. We're still seeing very good traction on the front end right out of the gates once we get the remodel done, and the scripts tend to follow behind that. And consumer reaction seems to be very good, and we're pretty happy with the results. So I would say it's very consistent with what we've seen over the last couple of years.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Edward Kelly (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then, John, you mentioned not participating in preferred networks as one of the headwinds here. As you think about going into next year, how's your thought process there evolving? How much of an opportunity is it for you? Because you don't have a national footprint from a store face so can you be a bigger participant there, if you want to be?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nI think if we wanted to be, I think we could. I mean, there are still some networks that are just never offered to us. That's the way the industry works. But there are, I think, there are some others that we have -- we do have strong regional presence in many markets where I think it's really -- it's a bit of a trade-off between rate and access that we've got to continue to grapple with.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Edward Kelly (Analysts)】\nAnd just last question then. There's obviously been a lot of question about reimbursement rates, and we are hearing it from other players in the industry. I don't think anybody's really asked the question as to why has this year been tougher. I know every year it's kind of tough, but what is it about the current year that's making it tougher it seems like for everyone?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nI think for us, what we -- I think what we've talked about a little bit is -- and I think someone kind of talked about it earlier, we saw a lot of benefit coming through the large generic wave the prior couple of years. And it just takes a while for rates in the marketplace to catch up to that. And I think that's what we've been kind of digesting here. And that trickles into this year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Edward Kelly (Analysts)】\nDoes scale at all help with -- that often does, right?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nThat does. I mean, I think what our arrangement, I think, with McKesson has clearly helped us drive down cost and helped us gain some efficiency in our distribution model.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Edward Kelly (Analysts)】\nWhat about scale at retail, though?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nI think scale at retail, where it's probably maybe most significant -- because I think on the purchasing side, on the drug side, I think we have scale. I mean, if you took how we purchase drugs and sort of compared it, I think, to maybe where our 2 largest competitors are when you combine our volume with everything that McKesson's doing globally, I think we stack up pretty nicely. And we should be competitive on that front, I think, going forward. Where we're a little weak is we have holes in the network. So where we would maybe be a little bit stronger maybe would be if we had a more complete store network, which is something we continue to try and sort of figure out a little bit.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Steven Valiquette (Analysts)】\nSo I had a couple on the PBM, too. Actually, you guys have kind of already answered as far as the revenues for next year. But the -- I guess, when you think about the $700 million plus of revenue, that implies mid-teens revenue growth just from those new lives. And then presumably, you'll get some organic revenue growth on the base book and from specialty as well. So I guess, just to kind of frame all that, should we assume potentially 20% plus type growth within that PBM organically for next year and really for the next few years? Is that sort of the right ballpark to think about that asset?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nWe're -- I think we're a little early to give you a long-term guidance on it. But I think we're -- I think some of the points you make are good ones. We're having a great selling season. We're excited to continue to work with the specialty asset, the specialty company that's inside of Envision. So we have some great opportunity here, but I don't think we're ready to peg some numbers for you yet.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Steven Valiquette (Analysts)】\nWith some of the additional biotech drugs coming out, the PCSK9 inhibitors, et cetera, does the specialty asset within Envision have a leverage to some of those new drugs and the PCSK9 in particular?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Sheehy (Executives)】\nYes, we expect that we will have access to those drugs going forward. Of course, it's going to be key on how we help our clients manage expenses as it relates to those drugs. So while those drugs could make sense, certainly for some patients, for some members, we want to make sure we have the appropriate processes in place to make sure they're getting to the right members so not to drive up the cost of our plan sponsors.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Karru Martinson (Analysts)】\nWhen you guys look at getting leverage -- back to your earlier targets of where you were prior to the acquisition, I mean, do you feel that, that keeps you out of the markets to add kind of the bolt-ons or perhaps larger acquisitions? Or do you feel that the debt markets [indiscernible] are still there and supportive of your structure?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nYes, I mean, again, I think we are going to work within that -- the confines of the capital structure that we have. We think we made the right decision to acquire EnvisionRx. It was the right way to deploy the capital that we had available. And so our focus will be on our core -- our 2 core businesses now to invest in things that are -- fit onto that. But it's clearly going to be smaller within the confines of our capital structure.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Karru Martinson (Analysts)】\nAnd when we look at the second half of the year, a number of other guys are talking about benefiting from lower gasoline prices, stronger, healthier consumer heading into the holidays. Kind of what are you seeing differently in terms of those front-end sales?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kenneth Martindale (Executives)】\nI don't know that we're seeing a whole lot of impact. A lot of our business is convenient business. People live close to our boxes. And so I think the consumer, hopefully, with the lower gas prices, will be a little more optimistic in spending in general. But I don't know that we see a big bump from lower gas prices. Overall, the front end's been fairly consistent, and we're looking forward to a reasonably good holiday season right now.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Rhyee (Analysts)】\nFirst, I wanted to talk -- ask about the PBM side. I think I saw some news come across. Envision made a couple of small acquisitions in the last couple of months. Did that have any benefit to the current quarter? Is that something we'll see a little bit later? And if you can maybe help size some of that contribution.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Darren Karst (Executives)】\nYes, I don't think it was significant for the current quarter. They were fairly small bolt-ons. The one thing I think that was very important about it is it added some geographic scope to us. It's a lot of East Coast business. Frank, you may have...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Sheehy (Executives)】\nYes, they were -- again, I don't think they're significant, certainly not immediately in size, but they do give us a presence on the East Coast for our MedTrak organization. And as we look to expand MedTrak, which we do think is a key part of our growth strategy to have the traditional model expanding into a national model, I think that will pay significant long-term dividends for us. And that was the basis behind these small acquisitions.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Rhyee (Analysts)】\nOkay. Were they -- was any contribution from them included in that sort of 700,000 net new lives that you mentioned earlier?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Sheehy (Executives)】\nNo, that would be -- those acquisitions would be additive to the 700,000 lives that I mentioned earlier.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Rhyee (Analysts)】\nOkay, great. And then I just had a question back about sort of the new same-store sales guidance. Just kind of tying together some of the comments you made to previous questions, I mean, it sounds like some of this is really less market-related and more how you want to manage sort of promotion and margin versus traffic. Is that the right -- am I understanding that correctly?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nI think that's a little bit of an impact on the pharmacy side. I mean, Ken, on the front end, it's...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kenneth Martindale (Executives)】\nYes, I don't think that's probably the case on the front end. Yes, I would say that promotional environment's pretty similar to what it's been. And our position promotionally is pretty similar to how it's been. We're still seeing some maturation with Plenti as customers get used to it, and we're looking forward to Plenti paying some pretty good dividends as customers do get more accustomed to how it works.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Rhyee (Analysts)】\nWith Plenti, is it an issue where if I'm a Plenti member but from one of the partner companies, is it that I'm not fully aware yet of how the Rite Aid reward program works, and is -- so is that just an education process to get them to understand sort of how the sort of the purchasing level breaks, that they get better discounts?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kenneth Martindale (Executives)】\nYes, I think they probably are not going to really understand that until they start shopping with us because Plenti doesn't educate anybody on our wellness+ tier structure. So I think initially, it's more just getting people used to the concept of a coalition loyalty program. Because in the United States, people really aren't used to earning points in multiple places and being able to redeem them. So there's that education, and we are seeing some new customers come in that signed up at our partner locations. And we think that over time, we'll be able to convert those folks, and that there will be some education. But right now, it's really just getting people used to how to shop with a coalition loyalty program.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Rhyee (Analysts)】\nOkay, great. And sorry, my last question for Darren. I think you had mentioned earlier there was -- you were accelerating sort of a deal-related amortization. Can you go over those comments again? And why would that be the case?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Darren Karst (Executives)】\nYes, well, it's early. So we're kind of working through purchase accounting for the transaction right now. It looks like the valuation of our customer relationships are going to be a little bit higher than what they had been for Envision. And the amortization is going to be a little more accelerated. That's -- so it's creating a little more amortization expense -- deal amortization expense.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Carla Casella (Analysts)】\nCan you hear me?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nYes, we can now.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Carla Casella (Analysts)】\nSorry about that. I just switched phones. One is just a housekeeping item. You mentioned the revolver draw. Could I just get the availability on it?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Darren Karst (Executives)】\nYes, I believe it's....\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nIt is $1.2 billion.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Darren Karst (Executives)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Carla Casella (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then have you provided -- your guidance for the year includes Envision for the portion of the year, it was included -- pro forma EBITDA as if it were included for the full year, what we would be looking at?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Matt Schroeder (Executives)】\nWe -- in the slides we put out, we had a pro forma leverage calculation, Carla. So there, we used $155 million, which is the midpoint of the $150 million to $160 million that we said we do for '15 when we announced the deal.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Darren Karst (Executives)】\n[indiscernible]\n\n---\n\n【回答: Matt Schroeder (Executives)】\n[indiscernible] you want that to calculate the leverage, correct?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Darren Karst (Executives)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Carla Casella (Analysts)】\nExactly.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Wiltamuth (Analysts)】\nFor Ken, could you maybe talk about how you're doing on that transition to Core-Mark for distribution of tobacco and some of those 5 front-end categories? Is it helping on cost? Is it helping on in-stock position? Maybe just a little feedback on how the stores are transitioning with that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kenneth Martindale (Executives)】\nI think they're doing pretty well, Mark. Obviously, when you make a major transition like that, there's a few bumps on the road, and we've experienced a few of those. But I think overall, it's gone well. It helps us because it gives them some scale and makes it a little easier for them to visit our stores more frequently and it drops some of those costs for us on distribution. So overall, I think it's been good. It takes some inventory out of our system, and we're pleased with the progress that we've made so far.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Wiltamuth (Analysts)】\nOkay, does that take any of the heat off your new distribution facility because you're not going be doing tobacco there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kenneth Martindale (Executives)】\nNot really. I mean, tobacco's a fairly easy category to handle. But it simplifies things a little bit because we don't have to worry about stamps and the cigarettes and everything. So it really doesn't -- it doesn't really apply to that DC. It was really more of an overall network opportunity for us to leverage them and give them a little more volume.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Wiltamuth (Analysts)】\nAnd for you, is it more of a \"cost of goods sold\" savings? Or are you doing better on in-stock?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kenneth Martindale (Executives)】\nIt helps our distribution cost substantially, and it should help our in-stocks. But it's more really helping us on the supply chain side, honestly.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Matt Schroeder (Executives)】\nWant to thank everybody for calling in today. Appreciate your time and have a good day.",

      "transcript_text1": "Good. Let's start. Well, good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Super Thursday announcement from NEXT of our half year results. I'd like -- you've probably noticed there's a different face up here this morning, and I would just like to welcome Amanda and say how delighted I am that she has joined us up here.\n\n---\n\nThank you.\n\n---\n\nGood morning. Well, I think we had a good 6 months. Our sales were up 3.5%, which was slightly higher than the range that we gave you earlier this year. Profit's up 7% and earnings per share up by 8%. During this year, we've done no share buybacks, but we have, up to date, returned GBP 400 million to shareholders through dividends and special dividends.\r\nYou'll have noticed in the notes that have gone out, that we expect Directory debt to go up by GBP 200 million this year. We have to finance that, and the board have agreed that we will do that out of our existing debt facilities, and it won't affect return of cash to shareholders. So we will return all of our surplus cash to shareholders in the form of either share buybacks or special dividends for the remainder of this year.\r\nLooking forward, we expect sales to be a little bit stronger against last year in the second half, but we've left our estimated profit and the same guidance as we gave in July, which is GBP 805 million to GBP 845 million, so that hasn't changed. The rest will come from Simon.\n\n---\n\nYou've given half the presentation already. Good morning, everybody. So as the Chairman said, actually, sales up 2.7%, but full price sales up 3.5%. Not our most sparkling season, but about 2% better than we were expecting on full price. And the reason we were so conservative, to put that in context, that's 16% up on 2 years ago. So this time last year, we had a very good first half. Operating profit up 6.7%. Main driver there is bought-in gross margin, and the difference between full price sales and operating profit is bought-in gross margin.\r\nProfit before tax. Interest charges flat on last year. Outstanding debt around about the same as last year. Looking forward to the full year, we're expecting debt to rise for the full year, but interest charges, last year GBP 30 million; year ahead, we're expecting around GBP 31 million. Interest charges won't go up necessarily by as much as you'd expect because last year, we had a lot of cash on deposit earning very little interest. So the cost of depleting that cash is low. Taxation charge of 20.2% is in line with the national rate for corporations.\r\nEarnings per share up 8%. This is boosted by buybacks at the beginning of last year. Ordinary dividend up 6% at the half, and we would expect that to be 1/3 of the total dividend -- ordinary dividend paid this year, and the 6% is in line with our forecast for growth and earnings per share for the full year.\r\nMoving on to cash flow. First thing to say is the GBP 70 million outflow in operational cash. This is cash flow before any distribution to shareholders. 2 things are going on here: increased CapEx and increased flow of cash into Directory debt.\r\nIn terms of capital expenditure, up in the first half and expected to be up for the full year. And looking forward to the full year, we expect a GBP 45 million increase in CapEx, GBP 20 million of that coming from increased expenditure on new openings. Of that -- sorry, on stores. Of that, GBP 10 million of that increase is an increase in cosmetic refits. So last year, we spent GBP 6 million, which was unusually low amount for us to spend on cosmetics throughout maintenance CapEx; this year, around GBP 15 million. We would expect that number to average around GBP 11 million for the next 2 or 3 years.\r\nSystems, an increase of GBP 7 million here. Of that increase, GBP 6 million of it relates to the purchase of new tills required to operate our new till system. And just to be clear, on systems CapEx, we only capitalize hardware. So this is the cost of writing the software, which we've done ourselves, is written off against revenues. That GBP 6 million is a hardware cost rather than software cost.\r\nAnd head office, we continue the process of making our head office fit for purpose this year. We're building a photo studio on-site, which will -- makes much more efficient at photographing our samples. We will extend and refurbish our children's wear department, refurbish our product and finance departments, and we will -- we have now completed a new systems building. I would expect that head office infrastructure figure to drop dramatically next year, certainly to be less than GBP 10 million.\r\nWarehouse, GBP 27 million. The increase of GBP 15 million here is more than all accounted for by the GBP 20 million that we're spending on the new furniture warehouse. That warehouse won't be complete till next year. We expect further GBP 15 million of CapEx on that project in the first half of next year. It should be up and running sort of middle of next year.\r\nIn terms of working capital, big outflow here, around GBP 70 million. There's GBP 135 million outflow into Directory debt, and that's been offset by less outflow into stock and some property stock that has bought cash back into the business.\r\nIn terms of distribution to shareholders, 2 special dividends last year, both for 50p. This year, 2 special dividends, one of 60p, one of 50p, so a slight increase in the amount of paid out in special dividends.\r\nShare buybacks, GBP 105 million last year. That was the last -- the last set of buybacks that we did and that hasn't occurred this year. So we had -- in summary, had GBP 70 million less inflow from operations and GBP 100 million less outflow from shareholder distributions roughly, GBP 90 million less outflow.\r\nIn terms of the balance sheet. Stock up 5.5%. This is pretty much in line with our forecast for sales in the second half. The midpoint of our sales guidance for the second half is 5.5%. Debtors, this is where there's a significant increase, 18.6% increase. And this is being driven by this  GBP 135 million increase in Directory debt, which is up 21% on last year. That wasn't expected. It's not being driven by credit sales. Credit sales were only up 2%. This is all being driven by the fact that our customers are paying down their balances slower as a result of us changing our minimum payment rules.\r\nYou'll be pleased to hear that I'm going to talk about that in great length later, so you've got something to look forward to as I plow through the numbers.\r\nNet debt at the half year, GBP 20 million down. Looking forward to net debt for the full year. We started the year with GBP 515 million of debt. We expect to generate through operations GBP 386 million of surplus cash. That's cash after paying interest, dividends and ordinary dividends and CapEx. We plan to distribute that through 4 special dividends, 3 of which have been paid, 1 of which has been announced. So a GBP 341 million outflow into special dividends, and on top of that, a further outflow of GBP 200 million into Directory debt. And, obviously, there's a question here as to whether the outflow into Directory debt should be funded through our balance sheet or funded through reducing the amount of special dividends we pay going forward. We've decided to fund it through our balance sheet as the Chairman -- as Chairman mentioned.\r\nJust to explain our logic here, year-end debt of GBP 670 million. First and foremost, that debt, we believe, is comfortably within the investment-grade levels that we have set as our objective for the company. I know that there are people -- Andrew Jones, our Treasurer, was very worried about me saying this because he thought that the credit rating people in the room would be offended that we were usurping there. I said, this is a very rough -- a rough estimate of what the amount is. What you can see is that there's clearly a long way off our year-end levels. So first of all, investment-grade. Secondly, our financing is very secure. Our peak financing requirements for the year around GBP 900 million. That's covered by GBP 788 million of bonds and a further GBP 550 million of bank facilities. So we've got headroom of over GBP 400 million from our peak borrowing requirements, which last about 1 week.\r\nSo we think the financing is very secure. And what you'll see from this is that the financing is secure even if we lose the -- even if we don't renew, or replace rather, the 2016 bond, which it is our intention to do, but we don't need to do that.\r\nThe final thing is the Directory debt is a high-yield secured asset that covers the cost of its own financing 3x to 5x. So for all those reasons, we think the right thing to do is fund it through the balance sheet. And actually, about 75% of it is funded through the balance sheet.\r\nMoving on to retail. That's the picture of our new shop in High Wycombe, which we hope -- which is forecast to take around GBP 15 million, but assessed [ph] at around GBP 30 [ph] million.\r\nRetail sales up 0.2%, full price sales up 0.8%. In terms of where that growth has come from, 2.2% growth from new space, so same-store sales down on last year as we expected. The net space increase is 3.6%, which means that the yield on the additional space is around 61%. We would expect that this number to hover around 60%. You'll remember last year, it was exceptionally high at around 80%. That's a more normal return.\r\nNew store performance. In terms of the financial performance of the new stores that we've opened over the last 12 months, new stores are still doing really well for us, 10% ahead of the targets we set them, payback of 18 months on the net capital invested and a net branch profitability, that's the profit of the store before central overheads, of 24%. So really healthy -- still very healthy growth in space.\r\nIn terms of looking at what will happen to our portfolio for the full year, we start the year at -- we started the year with 539 shops. We aim to open 22, of which 8 are re-sites of existing shops, extend 13 shops and close 19 shops, of which 11 are re-sites.\r\nAnd the sharp ones amongst you will have instantly noticed that there appears to be a problem with the slide. In that, we're re-siting 8 shops into new, but closing 11. And the reason for that is that on 1 site, we're closing 2 shops to open 1 new one. Another site, we've closed the shop, but we will close the shop before the year-end, but open the new shop after the year-end. And the final one is because we are re-siting to an extension rather than a re-site. So just wanted to explain the anomaly before anyone picks up on it.\r\n542 shops is what we intend -- to end the year, around 300,000 square feet of additional space, an increase of 4% on last year, 50,000 less than where we had hoped to be. That's because 2 stores have slipped from opening at the back end of this year into the front end of next year. We don't -- those -- the slippage of those 2 stores won't make any material difference to the numbers in either year.\r\nIn terms of retail profit, an increase in margin of 0.8%. All of that is about margin. Bought-in gross margin up 0.8%. We didn't intend our bought-in gross margin to be up 0.8%. We set our targets flat with last year. We had a very good buying rate and the buyers overachieved. So the buyer is not allowed to miss their margin target, but they are allowed to overachieve it and they did so with gusto. Obviously, that does put some pressure on the margins in the first half of next year, which you need to be mindful of, although we have set our spring-summer margins to be -- next year to be in line with last year -- in line with this year, rather. Does that makes sense?\r\nMarkdown, an improvement of 0.2%. We had less stock going into the sale. We actually didn't sell it through as well as the previous year. But the overall effect of that, combined with an exceptional stock price of last year, was a slight improvement on -- in markdown.\r\nAchieved gross margin up 1%. We should say that for the autumn season, we don't expect any improvement in bought-in gross margin. And we have visibility of those numbers, so you should rely on that.\r\nStore payroll, adverse movement to 0.2%. 2 things going on here. Pay rises, which I'll talk about later, cost us around -- pay rise and same-store sales decline cost us around 0.6%. Productivity measures and improvements reduced that by 0.4%.\r\nStore occupancy, adverse movement to 0.1%. Same-store sales moving backwards increases rents and rates as a percentage of sales, but depreciation is declining as more stores are -- become fully depreciated. In addition -- in terms of actual rental inflation itself, we're not seeing any significant rental inflation in our store portfolio at the moment. And the vast majority of renewals are at 0 or at around 0 and reviews at around 0.\r\nWarehouse and distribution, adverse movement of 0.2%. This is all about wages in the warehouse rising slightly faster than sales. Central overheads, positive movement. This is because we're expecting profits to be up less this year than last year, and therefore, things like incentives will be lower this year than last year.\r\nMoving on to Directory. Increase of 8.2%, which is GBP 58 million increase. And I thought it would be useful, because of the structure of Directory is changing. We used to just break that out in terms of where that growth has come from.\r\nNEXT U.K., there's a NEXT brand -- branded stock sold in the U.K., was up GBP 19 million. That was much better than we're expecting. We're actually expecting GBP 10 million for the full year, so we underestimated NEXT brand in the U.K., still only up 3.5% on last year.\r\nLABEL, up 30% on last year, an increase of GBP 22 million. This is not as good as it looks. Full price sales were up more like 20%. So we'd slightly over-edged the LABEL target.\r\nTotal Directory U.K. up 6%, GBP 41 million and then on top of that, another GBP 17 million from overseas, growing at 24%.\r\nActually, I should've said LABEL margin, we predicted was going to be 15%. And despite the increase in markdown, because more of this stock went through wholesale rather than commission, we still expect our margin on LABEL sales to be around 15% for the full year. That's without interest, so just I should reiterate that.\r\nIn terms of overseas, overseas hit its sales target, but we are expecting some margin erosion. And we had hoped to achieve 18% profit, we'll actually choose 16.5% profit. The reason for that is that we've had some very big devaluations in Eastern Europe, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Russia. And in those countries, we haven't passed on the full effect of the devaluation to the customer. Still making a profit in those countries, but not as big a profit as we were hoping. We sort of shared the pain with the consumer, so we're expecting 16.5% profit on our overseas business this year.\r\nIn terms of total sales, GBP 58 million, 8.2%. That 8.2% has come from growth in our customer base of 13%, of which 7% is growth in U.K. customers, 65% growth in overseas customers. Obviously, the overseas customers growing far faster than the base because the newest customers spend the least.\r\nThe 7% though, although on the surface of things, that looks very healthy, 6. -- 6% growth from 7% customers. Underneath there is a structural change in terms of what's happening with our credit and cash customers, and I'm going to cover that in much more detail later.\r\nOperating profit up 7%, so margin erosion in Directory. Bought-in gross margin up 0.5%, not the 0.8% experienced in retail. On NEXT stock, the bought-in gross margin did increase by 0.8%. However, because Directory has LABEL stock and overseas stock that is at lower bought-in gross margins, that has suppressed the growth in bought-in gross margin in Directory.\r\nMarkdown, an adverse movement to 0.5%. We kept pretty much all of the sales stock the Directory generated, we kept in Directory. Normally, we transfer some to retail. But as the Directory sale has become more efficient at clearing stock, so the business has kept more of its stock. So stock for sale was up 22%, sales were only up -- sales weren't up at all, they were flat, which causes adverse movement of 0.5%. That is slightly misleading because the timing of the sale meant that a lot of the sale dispatches this year happened in the second half rather than the first half and that was the difference in timing.\r\nIf you take the sale over the first few weeks, sale over the first 4 weeks, you'll find that the sale -- sales to date on sales stock are up 18%. So we will recover some of that margin in the second half, about 0.3% it. Around GBP 2 million worth of that loss in the first half will come back in the second half.\r\nSo achieved gross margin flat. Interest income, adverse movement to 0.2%. This is because credit sales and interest income are growing slower than sales. Bad debt continue -- we continue to see -- so much of a surprise, we continue to see an improvement in bad debt. Marketing costs, an improvement to 0.4%. Part of this is about a provision we took last year, then didn't use and released this year, that's about 0.2% of that. The balance is saving on publications. I'm sorry, not publications, it's a saving on some unproductive marketing we did last year. I apologize.\r\nWarehouse and distribution, adverse movement to 0.9%. Of that 0.9%, 0.2% of it is a result of wage inflation in the warehouses. The balance, 0.7%, is because the participation of our overseas business is growing, and that has much higher warehouse and distribution costs. Central overheads, same comment as retail, so overall up 0.3% and no erosion in Directory margins.\r\nDirectory margins for the full year, we're expecting to be sort of flattish as we are expecting retail margins taking off to be flattish as well. But long term, what you can see from this is that the growth in our overseas business and the decline in the credit business will, long term, put structural pressure on the net margins of Directory. So that's something you should put into your longer-term plans, which I know are much longer than our own, because you have much more complex spreadsheets that are much more exciting.\r\nSo moving on to the focus part of the presentation. And you'll notice this presentation is mercifully -- feels mercifully quick today, because I know you've got far more important companies to rush off and cover later on. So we'll be a little bit briefer today. I'm going to start with Directory credit.\r\nWe've already talked about the 7% increase in total customer base. That is made up of 2 things: 40% increase in our cash customers. These are customers that come onto the site and pay immediately using debit and credit cards. That number, just -- these are a little bit of a health warning, because it's quite -- it's harder to tell with cash customers whether it's the same customer returning or not.\r\nIf they've moved and come back with a different email address, then it's much harder to trace them back to the same thing than if they had an account where they tend to -- it's more obvious that they're restarting. So cash customers, very good growth, and this is about us reaching a whole other people who 10, 15 years ago wouldn't even have considered themselves to be mail order shoppers at all. The downside of that is that our credit customer base is eroding. It's running at a rate around 0.3%. It's important to understand the nature of that decline. It's not that our credit customers are leaving us in larger numbers. So if you look at the attrition rates, this is the percentage of the customer base that closes their account each year.\r\nWhat you can see is it actually has remained steady for the last 3 years and actually has declined in the current year. And we would expect -- as the base declines, we would expect the quality to improve, so that shouldn't come as a surprise. The thing that's holding the -- that's moving the credit business back is the number of new recruits. And what you see is a dramatic fall in number of new recruits into this year, and that's what's giving us our net fall. It's not quite as bad as it looks because credit sales are still growing, albeit margin. So the customers who remain with us are spending more on average.\r\nSo I don't think that, that credit sales increase running ahead of the declining base makes the problem any less. What it does do is probably delay the problem. It turns into sort of a less of an acute problem, more of a chronic problem for the Directory. The question is what can we do about it? We talked about this in the year-end results and 2 things: first is, 6 months ago, this is all we were doing to promote the account, pay on account or pay now. That was the only choice you got. We've done a whole lot of trials to promote the use of the account at point of order, both for first-time cash orders and when they come back to the site to reorder. We succeed -- that's had some moderate success. We've had credit take up move from around 7% of new starters to 14% of new starters. That is not enough to arrest the decline, and we'll -- it should slow it down a little bit, but it was not enough to arrest the decline in the customer base, and it's certainly not enough to grow it.\r\nAnd I think the thing that we have to realize as a business is that if the credit business is to grow, and we're not sure that it can, but if it is to grow, then it needs to fundamentally change and recognize that it isn't competing with old mail order-style accounts or even store cards. It's really got to compete with credit cards. And we started that process 6 months ago. As we said in our presentation in March, we reduced our minimum payments from 9.4%, which was unusually high, to 5%, which is at the top end of the credit card minimum payments. Credit card minimum payments tend to be between 2% and 5%. This, obviously, gives the customer greater flexibility and a sense of security as well that they're not going to -- they don't need to worry as much about their Directory account if, in any 1 month, they don't have so much money.\r\nWe have been really surprised by the effect that this has had because it hasn't just affected the customers who pay the minimum payment; it's affected virtually the whole base. And if you look at what happened to our balances, we introduced the change in February, and this is what happened to our credit balances since then. Around GBP 120 million of additional debt, and that is -- you'll remember, I said GBP 135 million additional debt earlier on, the GBP 15 million is driven by sales. This is driven by the change.\r\nWe think that, that will be around GBP 200 million by the end of the year. Now we won't panic for this. We thought it'd be between GBP 30 million and GBP 40 million. And obviously, the upside of this is that it gives us potentially an enormous increase in interest income.\r\nAnd we've been debating -- we've debated what to do with that. And obviously -- the obvious thing to do is to take it straight to profit. We think the right thing to do, both in terms of treating our customers fairly and in terms of making sure that the business stands a chance of growing in the long term, is to give the lion's share of that back to our customers through an APR reduction, so we intend to reduce the APR from 24.99% to 22.9%. It's still at a high rate, but it puts us in the credit card range. And remember, that it was 25.99% 18 months ago.\r\nJust to sort of give you a feel of where that sits in competitive terms. Home shopping, these are 5 major home shopping -- the 5 major home shopping account companies. Their interest rates range from around 30% to 41%. The one with the bar in between, they've got 2 rates, a high-risk rate and a low risk rate. Store card rates are running from between 20% to 30%. Again, 20% is only for low-risk customers. Credit card market running between somewhere 26% and 16%, 26% for high-risk customers, 16% for low-risk customers. Where that leaves our account, not super competitive for credit cards, but not completely out of the ballpark. And we think that, that gives it a chance of being competitive going forward.\r\nIn addition, when I come on to talk about the profitability, you'll see that there is a potential that we may have underestimated the profit from the additional GBP 200 million of debt. If we have, we intend to reinvest that at some point, probably in the middle of next year, in further interest rate reductions. Probably, we will look to differentiate between high-risk and low-risk customers, so that we'll be competitive at the low risk end. We think actually at the high risk end, we already are quite competitive at 22.9%. But we're looking at -- to be more competitive at the low risk end. So that's sort of the plan for business. But that does -- that is contingent on us making the profit on that.\r\nIn terms of profitability, just looking at the full year profit, GBP 200 million of debt, additional interest income at the previous rate of interest would have given us GBP 50 million of income. Bad debt provision at 6.5%. That is higher than we are currently experiencing on the whole base. And the reason we've taken that view is because we don't yet know what the effect of the minimum payments will be on bad debt. It may be that giving people longer to pay actually degrades the value -- degrades the quality of the debt, so we've been quite conservative about that.\r\nCost of funding, around -- we seeing the 4% cost of funding around the cost of our bonds, gives us a gross gain of GBP 29 million. An APR reduction of 2% will cost us GBP 19 million. It leaves the net profit of GBP 10 million, which is 5% on the GBP 200 million that we've invested. And in terms of return on capital, adding back the cost of funding, return on capital at 9%, which, not coincidentally, is 1% ahead of the rate in which -- of which we're prepared to buy back our shares. In terms of the effect in this year, we expect the net profit to be around -- the net profit effect to be around GBP 1 million in the current year.\r\nMoving on to retail wages. Obviously, this has been a subject of much discussion, comments. And I thought that this is -- there are 2 sections here. First of all, to talk about what NEXT has done with its wages, because I think we're slightly ahead of the curve, and the second is to talk about the effect of the living wage premium.\r\nIn terms of what we've done, this is a history of the national minimum wage. And this is what's -- what we've done with our starter rates. We started this journey about 2.5 years ago because we wanted to improve the quality of service that we had in the stores, and we recognized that in order to do that, we were going to have to increase our pay rates and change some of our terms and conditions.\r\nSo this is what's happened to pay rates. Pay rates have by -- in October, when the national minimum wage goes to GBP 6.70, our wage would go to GBP 7.04. That is before an average of 50p per hour bonus that we pay in customer service bonuses. So there is another -- in reality, there's another 50p to add to that.\r\nIn terms of increase on 2012, that's a 13% pay increase. As important, if not more important, we have changed the way we recruit and contract our staff. In the past, we've gone for very large numbers on small contracts in the belief that, that gives us flexibility, and it does to a certain extent give you flexibility. The problem is a lot of people working on low-hour contracts means that you have people who aren't particularly experienced, training is a big percentage of that total cost and they're less loyal to the business.\r\nThe other thing is that it doesn't give you the flexibility that at first, it might appear to, because the -- if you give someone a very low contract at hours per week, they're more likely to take on another job, which means they actually become less flexible. So we've moved significantly as through natural turnover, as people have left the business rather than recruit people to replace them, we have reallocated their hours across the staff base.\r\nAnd as a result of that -- sorry, I should say before that, you're wondering how is that funded, the 13% pay rise? Payroll as a percentage of sales in 2012 was 11.9%. You would expect, given a 13% increase in starter rates, that to go up to at least 12.5%, it's up to 12.8%. In fact, it's actually gone up by 0.2%. So the majority of this has been funded through productivity improvements, some of which I've bored you with in the past. There's no one big idea that that spans this [ph] lots and lots of small initiatives to improve productivity.\r\nBut coming back to hours. What we've done is increase hours by 26%, which means on average, the average member of staff is only 43% more with NEXT than they were 4 years ago. We think that gives us more experienced, better trained, better motivated and more loyal staff.\r\nIn terms of the living wage premium. It's taken us some time to get our heads around this. The Chancellor said 2 things: first of all, he said the living wage premium will be reaching 60% of the median earnings by 2020; and the other is that it was set to reach GBP 9 by 2020. And the first thing to understand is that those 2 things are not necessarily the same thing, in that it makes an assumption about what will happen to inflation in median wages between now and 2020.\r\nAnd what we've done is separate out the effect of the -- taking the living wage premium of 60% to the effect of inflation on general wages and the median itself. So in terms of analyzing that, national minimum wage, that's not our rate, the national minimum wage of GBP 6.70, that goes to GBP 7.20 next year. That will cost us around GBP 2 million in 2016.\r\nIn terms of taking that to the median, assuming no inflation in wages, that will go to GBP 7.85. So that would take it to GBP 7.85, and it's the assumed assumption which the OBR forecast to be around 4.5%. And if you want to read -- a fascinating read on this, try appendix B of the OBR's financial outlook -- July financial outlook document. It really is actually very interesting and worth reading, but that is the inflation that takes you from GBP 7.85 to GBP 9.35.\r\nSo there are 2 elements to this. There's a legislative element, which gets that GBP 7.85. An inflation element that takes it forecast to GBP 9.35. In order to get it to GBP 9, wage inflation would need to be 3.5% per annum in the median.\r\nIn terms of assessing the cost, the likely costs to NEXT, given the scenario set out by the OBR, this is how we've analyzed it. We take our staff wages of 2016 at GBP 7.20. That's 55% of the median. We then looked that the other levels of management in the business. And what you can see is that, I had to go from supervisor to junior manager, floor manager, store manager. As we progressed through the wage hierarchy, we are getting a sort of 9% to 10% wage differential at each level.\r\nIf that -- if the staff level goes to GBP 7.85, you can see there's only a 2p difference with the next manager up. What we've assumed for the purposes of our modeling is that we can compress the current 9%, 10% differential to around 7%. So this is assuming a 7% differential, which we think at these rates of pay should be enough to encourage people to take promotion.\r\nThat means the first level manager has to go up 6.7%, next one at 4.6%, 2.7% and at 0.5% manager. At around GBP 10.50, there's no further knock-on effect. In terms of the cost of that, the cost is around GBP 11 million. That includes our estimate of any subcontracted costs, where subcontractors are paying the -- are not yet paid the living wage premium.\r\nThe knock-on effect is surprisingly high at GBP 16 million. Most of that doesn't come from these managers. We would have to -- you all look at that and think we've got far too many managers if that were the case. The knock-on effect comes from the fact that more skilled jobs within the business, more skilled or more demanding jobs which are less attractive, currently have a 9%, 10% premium to our store wages, things like call center operatives. And we've assumed that those wages, that if a call center operative was on the same level as a junior supervisor, that their wages would have to rise by as much to attract them to that job rather than doing a shop drop. So that's why the knock-on effect is much higher than you might initially expect. Cost of that is GBP 27 million. So a lot of money, but in the scheme of things, it's not transformative.\r\nIf you then add on 4.5% inflation, it doesn't make any difference to the cost of the living wage premium. The orange and the green blocks remain exactly the same. But obviously, that 4.5% is a big cost because if you translate that across our wage bill, which is around GBP 600 million across the group, that adds another GBP 120 million of cost. So you're at GBP 147 million of additional cost to the group in 2020 if wage inflation comes through as expected.\r\nWhat you can see from that is that the living wage premium is a relatively small part of the total increase. In terms of the price rises required to pay for that, we estimate the price rise would need to be in the order of 6%. So -- of which 1% comes from the living wage premium.\r\nIncidentally, in case you're thinking, we would always choose to pass it through as price rather than take the cost hit, because if you take a cost hit of 104 [ph] -- if you do the math, the maths are overwhelming in favor of price rise. Because you say, take GBP 147 million as a percentage of our profits, that's around 18%. If you work out what sales would have to fall by to give us the same drop in profit, you're at a level that could not possibly be caused by a 6% price increase. So we were -- in the past, when we increased our prices by around 7% about 3, 4 years ago, when we had a big devaluation in the pound, and that adversely affected sales by about 1.5%.\r\nSo what you can see is that, given the choice, take the hit or pass it on, the maths are overwhelming in favor of passing on the cost, particularly if wages have risen by 4.5% per annum, because that 6% price increase needs to be taken in the context of a country where, on average, people are earning 19% and more.\r\nSo actually, in the OBR scenario, the effect of the living wage premium at GBP 27 million is not -- it's not welcome, but it's not unmanageable. The problem potentially comes if wage inflation falls below the 3.5% and the 60% median target is dropped and the GBP 9 target is maintained. Because once you start moving the living wage premium much above 60%, it begins to have 2 impacts, and it's worth just explaining back to our chart here. That increases wages by 2% compound to 2020. Our staff will then be paid GBP 7.79 and getting them to GBP 9 would be a 15.6% increase, and what you can see is rather than being paid 2p less than the first manager, they're actually paid 50p more. So the increase required here is far greater and so on and so forth until you get to manager 4.\r\nBut what you then realize is actually, hold on a second, this is now affecting manager 5 because manager 4 is at GBP 11.97 and manager 5, through inflation, will only get to GBP 11.93. So you have to begin to cascade the effects of the median wage further up the wage hierarchy.\r\nAnd there are 2 problems on this: one is that the cost of implementing this, obviously, increased dramatically. So from GBP 27 million, we estimate this would cost nearer GBP 70 million, and we think that is probably conservative.\r\nThe other problem, which is more serious for the wider economy, is that at that point, the median wage will be GBP 14. So you end up with a situation where raising the living wage to GBP 9 begins to move the median. And then you end up with a situation that all of you will be hugely familiar with, with your circular references in your spreadsheets, which you tend to just fudge. I know that we all do that. But you end up with this potential inflationary loop, where the living wage premium begins to move the target against which it's set.\r\nSo in summary on this, if wage inflation comes through as expected, or even if it comes through anywhere at or around 3.5%, we're not worried. If it comes through at less than 3.5%, we're still not worried if the target remains 60%. The only worry would be if the target remains GBP 9 and inflation comes through at significantly less than 3.5%. In that situation, costs escalate and price rises would be less easy to swallow. Wages would still be rising faster than prices, but those price rises become harder to swallow, which would have an adverse impact on sales, which means that the impact on profit would be significant. Is that -- now I've said it, it all sounds completely simple. But I think that's where we are on the living wage premium.\r\nIn terms of profit guidance. Full Price sales for the full year, 3.5% to 6%. We haven't -- we only gave this forecast in July. I haven't seen anything in trade that would suggest we should change that. Second half, we're expecting to be between 3.5% and 7.5%. That might sound ambitious with 5.5% at the midpoint. It's significantly better than the first half, but remember that the first half was 16% up on 2 years.\r\nIf you look at the second half on 2 years, it's only at 10%. And at that point, everyone in the room moves from thinking, these guys are wild optimists to actually -- they are being too conservative on their sales estimates for the second half. We think this number is right. 2 years ago, it was a bad summer and a good Christmas. If you look at these numbers against 3 years ago, both come out exactly at 19%. So we think that these numbers are realistic. \r\nFull year -- full price sales, we're forecasting to be up GBP 160 million. And just we wanted to update you as to how we expect -- where we expect that growth to come from the first -- from the estimates we gave in the first half, lower than we originally forecast a drop in like-for-like sales, roughly same amount from New space. \r\nNEXT online, biggest winner in our forecast from GBP 10 million to GBP 50 million. LABEL around GBP 30 million, that's GBP 10 million less than we were expecting, but still a 20% increase in full price sales. Overseas, GBP 40 million, which is pretty much in line with our initial estimates.\r\nIn terms of where that leaves profit. Profit growth, we think, will be somewhere between 2.9% and 8%. Layer on top of that ordinary dividend yield of 2.2%, special dividend yield of 3.3% and that's based on GBP 72.33, which was the share price at the beginning of the year, gives total shareholder return of growth in earnings plus dividend somewhere between 8.4% and 13.5%, which, in the context of a very difficult first half, we think is respectable.\r\nAnd on that note, I'm going to finish. I think that is, for me, a record in terms of speed.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: R. Barton (Executives)】\nGood. Let's start. Well, good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Super Thursday announcement from NEXT of our half year results. I'd like -- you've probably noticed there's a different face up here this morning, and I would just like to welcome Amanda and say how delighted I am that she has joined us up here.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Amanda James (Executives)】\nThank you.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: R. Barton (Executives)】\nGood morning. Well, I think we had a good 6 months. Our sales were up 3.5%, which was slightly higher than the range that we gave you earlier this year. Profit's up 7% and earnings per share up by 8%. During this year, we've done no share buybacks, but we have, up to date, returned GBP 400 million to shareholders through dividends and special dividends.\r\nYou'll have noticed in the notes that have gone out, that we expect Directory debt to go up by GBP 200 million this year. We have to finance that, and the board have agreed that we will do that out of our existing debt facilities, and it won't affect return of cash to shareholders. So we will return all of our surplus cash to shareholders in the form of either share buybacks or special dividends for the remainder of this year.\r\nLooking forward, we expect sales to be a little bit stronger against last year in the second half, but we've left our estimated profit and the same guidance as we gave in July, which is GBP 805 million to GBP 845 million, so that hasn't changed. The rest will come from Simon.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Simon Wolfson (Executives)】\nYou've given half the presentation already. Good morning, everybody. So as the Chairman said, actually, sales up 2.7%, but full price sales up 3.5%. Not our most sparkling season, but about 2% better than we were expecting on full price. And the reason we were so conservative, to put that in context, that's 16% up on 2 years ago. So this time last year, we had a very good first half. Operating profit up 6.7%. Main driver there is bought-in gross margin, and the difference between full price sales and operating profit is bought-in gross margin.\r\nProfit before tax. Interest charges flat on last year. Outstanding debt around about the same as last year. Looking forward to the full year, we're expecting debt to rise for the full year, but interest charges, last year GBP 30 million; year ahead, we're expecting around GBP 31 million. Interest charges won't go up necessarily by as much as you'd expect because last year, we had a lot of cash on deposit earning very little interest. So the cost of depleting that cash is low. Taxation charge of 20.2% is in line with the national rate for corporations.\r\nEarnings per share up 8%. This is boosted by buybacks at the beginning of last year. Ordinary dividend up 6% at the half, and we would expect that to be 1/3 of the total dividend -- ordinary dividend paid this year, and the 6% is in line with our forecast for growth and earnings per share for the full year.\r\nMoving on to cash flow. First thing to say is the GBP 70 million outflow in operational cash. This is cash flow before any distribution to shareholders. 2 things are going on here: increased CapEx and increased flow of cash into Directory debt.\r\nIn terms of capital expenditure, up in the first half and expected to be up for the full year. And looking forward to the full year, we expect a GBP 45 million increase in CapEx, GBP 20 million of that coming from increased expenditure on new openings. Of that -- sorry, on stores. Of that, GBP 10 million of that increase is an increase in cosmetic refits. So last year, we spent GBP 6 million, which was unusually low amount for us to spend on cosmetics throughout maintenance CapEx; this year, around GBP 15 million. We would expect that number to average around GBP 11 million for the next 2 or 3 years.\r\nSystems, an increase of GBP 7 million here. Of that increase, GBP 6 million of it relates to the purchase of new tills required to operate our new till system. And just to be clear, on systems CapEx, we only capitalize hardware. So this is the cost of writing the software, which we've done ourselves, is written off against revenues. That GBP 6 million is a hardware cost rather than software cost.\r\nAnd head office, we continue the process of making our head office fit for purpose this year. We're building a photo studio on-site, which will -- makes much more efficient at photographing our samples. We will extend and refurbish our children's wear department, refurbish our product and finance departments, and we will -- we have now completed a new systems building. I would expect that head office infrastructure figure to drop dramatically next year, certainly to be less than GBP 10 million.\r\nWarehouse, GBP 27 million. The increase of GBP 15 million here is more than all accounted for by the GBP 20 million that we're spending on the new furniture warehouse. That warehouse won't be complete till next year. We expect further GBP 15 million of CapEx on that project in the first half of next year. It should be up and running sort of middle of next year.\r\nIn terms of working capital, big outflow here, around GBP 70 million. There's GBP 135 million outflow into Directory debt, and that's been offset by less outflow into stock and some property stock that has bought cash back into the business.\r\nIn terms of distribution to shareholders, 2 special dividends last year, both for 50p. This year, 2 special dividends, one of 60p, one of 50p, so a slight increase in the amount of paid out in special dividends.\r\nShare buybacks, GBP 105 million last year. That was the last -- the last set of buybacks that we did and that hasn't occurred this year. So we had -- in summary, had GBP 70 million less inflow from operations and GBP 100 million less outflow from shareholder distributions roughly, GBP 90 million less outflow.\r\nIn terms of the balance sheet. Stock up 5.5%. This is pretty much in line with our forecast for sales in the second half. The midpoint of our sales guidance for the second half is 5.5%. Debtors, this is where there's a significant increase, 18.6% increase. And this is being driven by this  GBP 135 million increase in Directory debt, which is up 21% on last year. That wasn't expected. It's not being driven by credit sales. Credit sales were only up 2%. This is all being driven by the fact that our customers are paying down their balances slower as a result of us changing our minimum payment rules.\r\nYou'll be pleased to hear that I'm going to talk about that in great length later, so you've got something to look forward to as I plow through the numbers.\r\nNet debt at the half year, GBP 20 million down. Looking forward to net debt for the full year. We started the year with GBP 515 million of debt. We expect to generate through operations GBP 386 million of surplus cash. That's cash after paying interest, dividends and ordinary dividends and CapEx. We plan to distribute that through 4 special dividends, 3 of which have been paid, 1 of which has been announced. So a GBP 341 million outflow into special dividends, and on top of that, a further outflow of GBP 200 million into Directory debt. And, obviously, there's a question here as to whether the outflow into Directory debt should be funded through our balance sheet or funded through reducing the amount of special dividends we pay going forward. We've decided to fund it through our balance sheet as the Chairman -- as Chairman mentioned.\r\nJust to explain our logic here, year-end debt of GBP 670 million. First and foremost, that debt, we believe, is comfortably within the investment-grade levels that we have set as our objective for the company. I know that there are people -- Andrew Jones, our Treasurer, was very worried about me saying this because he thought that the credit rating people in the room would be offended that we were usurping there. I said, this is a very rough -- a rough estimate of what the amount is. What you can see is that there's clearly a long way off our year-end levels. So first of all, investment-grade. Secondly, our financing is very secure. Our peak financing requirements for the year around GBP 900 million. That's covered by GBP 788 million of bonds and a further GBP 550 million of bank facilities. So we've got headroom of over GBP 400 million from our peak borrowing requirements, which last about 1 week.\r\nSo we think the financing is very secure. And what you'll see from this is that the financing is secure even if we lose the -- even if we don't renew, or replace rather, the 2016 bond, which it is our intention to do, but we don't need to do that.\r\nThe final thing is the Directory debt is a high-yield secured asset that covers the cost of its own financing 3x to 5x. So for all those reasons, we think the right thing to do is fund it through the balance sheet. And actually, about 75% of it is funded through the balance sheet.\r\nMoving on to retail. That's the picture of our new shop in High Wycombe, which we hope -- which is forecast to take around GBP 15 million, but assessed [ph] at around GBP 30 [ph] million.\r\nRetail sales up 0.2%, full price sales up 0.8%. In terms of where that growth has come from, 2.2% growth from new space, so same-store sales down on last year as we expected. The net space increase is 3.6%, which means that the yield on the additional space is around 61%. We would expect that this number to hover around 60%. You'll remember last year, it was exceptionally high at around 80%. That's a more normal return.\r\nNew store performance. In terms of the financial performance of the new stores that we've opened over the last 12 months, new stores are still doing really well for us, 10% ahead of the targets we set them, payback of 18 months on the net capital invested and a net branch profitability, that's the profit of the store before central overheads, of 24%. So really healthy -- still very healthy growth in space.\r\nIn terms of looking at what will happen to our portfolio for the full year, we start the year at -- we started the year with 539 shops. We aim to open 22, of which 8 are re-sites of existing shops, extend 13 shops and close 19 shops, of which 11 are re-sites.\r\nAnd the sharp ones amongst you will have instantly noticed that there appears to be a problem with the slide. In that, we're re-siting 8 shops into new, but closing 11. And the reason for that is that on 1 site, we're closing 2 shops to open 1 new one. Another site, we've closed the shop, but we will close the shop before the year-end, but open the new shop after the year-end. And the final one is because we are re-siting to an extension rather than a re-site. So just wanted to explain the anomaly before anyone picks up on it.\r\n542 shops is what we intend -- to end the year, around 300,000 square feet of additional space, an increase of 4% on last year, 50,000 less than where we had hoped to be. That's because 2 stores have slipped from opening at the back end of this year into the front end of next year. We don't -- those -- the slippage of those 2 stores won't make any material difference to the numbers in either year.\r\nIn terms of retail profit, an increase in margin of 0.8%. All of that is about margin. Bought-in gross margin up 0.8%. We didn't intend our bought-in gross margin to be up 0.8%. We set our targets flat with last year. We had a very good buying rate and the buyers overachieved. So the buyer is not allowed to miss their margin target, but they are allowed to overachieve it and they did so with gusto. Obviously, that does put some pressure on the margins in the first half of next year, which you need to be mindful of, although we have set our spring-summer margins to be -- next year to be in line with last year -- in line with this year, rather. Does that makes sense?\r\nMarkdown, an improvement of 0.2%. We had less stock going into the sale. We actually didn't sell it through as well as the previous year. But the overall effect of that, combined with an exceptional stock price of last year, was a slight improvement on -- in markdown.\r\nAchieved gross margin up 1%. We should say that for the autumn season, we don't expect any improvement in bought-in gross margin. And we have visibility of those numbers, so you should rely on that.\r\nStore payroll, adverse movement to 0.2%. 2 things going on here. Pay rises, which I'll talk about later, cost us around -- pay rise and same-store sales decline cost us around 0.6%. Productivity measures and improvements reduced that by 0.4%.\r\nStore occupancy, adverse movement to 0.1%. Same-store sales moving backwards increases rents and rates as a percentage of sales, but depreciation is declining as more stores are -- become fully depreciated. In addition -- in terms of actual rental inflation itself, we're not seeing any significant rental inflation in our store portfolio at the moment. And the vast majority of renewals are at 0 or at around 0 and reviews at around 0.\r\nWarehouse and distribution, adverse movement of 0.2%. This is all about wages in the warehouse rising slightly faster than sales. Central overheads, positive movement. This is because we're expecting profits to be up less this year than last year, and therefore, things like incentives will be lower this year than last year.\r\nMoving on to Directory. Increase of 8.2%, which is GBP 58 million increase. And I thought it would be useful, because of the structure of Directory is changing. We used to just break that out in terms of where that growth has come from.\r\nNEXT U.K., there's a NEXT brand -- branded stock sold in the U.K., was up GBP 19 million. That was much better than we're expecting. We're actually expecting GBP 10 million for the full year, so we underestimated NEXT brand in the U.K., still only up 3.5% on last year.\r\nLABEL, up 30% on last year, an increase of GBP 22 million. This is not as good as it looks. Full price sales were up more like 20%. So we'd slightly over-edged the LABEL target.\r\nTotal Directory U.K. up 6%, GBP 41 million and then on top of that, another GBP 17 million from overseas, growing at 24%.\r\nActually, I should've said LABEL margin, we predicted was going to be 15%. And despite the increase in markdown, because more of this stock went through wholesale rather than commission, we still expect our margin on LABEL sales to be around 15% for the full year. That's without interest, so just I should reiterate that.\r\nIn terms of overseas, overseas hit its sales target, but we are expecting some margin erosion. And we had hoped to achieve 18% profit, we'll actually choose 16.5% profit. The reason for that is that we've had some very big devaluations in Eastern Europe, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Russia. And in those countries, we haven't passed on the full effect of the devaluation to the customer. Still making a profit in those countries, but not as big a profit as we were hoping. We sort of shared the pain with the consumer, so we're expecting 16.5% profit on our overseas business this year.\r\nIn terms of total sales, GBP 58 million, 8.2%. That 8.2% has come from growth in our customer base of 13%, of which 7% is growth in U.K. customers, 65% growth in overseas customers. Obviously, the overseas customers growing far faster than the base because the newest customers spend the least.\r\nThe 7% though, although on the surface of things, that looks very healthy, 6. -- 6% growth from 7% customers. Underneath there is a structural change in terms of what's happening with our credit and cash customers, and I'm going to cover that in much more detail later.\r\nOperating profit up 7%, so margin erosion in Directory. Bought-in gross margin up 0.5%, not the 0.8% experienced in retail. On NEXT stock, the bought-in gross margin did increase by 0.8%. However, because Directory has LABEL stock and overseas stock that is at lower bought-in gross margins, that has suppressed the growth in bought-in gross margin in Directory.\r\nMarkdown, an adverse movement to 0.5%. We kept pretty much all of the sales stock the Directory generated, we kept in Directory. Normally, we transfer some to retail. But as the Directory sale has become more efficient at clearing stock, so the business has kept more of its stock. So stock for sale was up 22%, sales were only up -- sales weren't up at all, they were flat, which causes adverse movement of 0.5%. That is slightly misleading because the timing of the sale meant that a lot of the sale dispatches this year happened in the second half rather than the first half and that was the difference in timing.\r\nIf you take the sale over the first few weeks, sale over the first 4 weeks, you'll find that the sale -- sales to date on sales stock are up 18%. So we will recover some of that margin in the second half, about 0.3% it. Around GBP 2 million worth of that loss in the first half will come back in the second half.\r\nSo achieved gross margin flat. Interest income, adverse movement to 0.2%. This is because credit sales and interest income are growing slower than sales. Bad debt continue -- we continue to see -- so much of a surprise, we continue to see an improvement in bad debt. Marketing costs, an improvement to 0.4%. Part of this is about a provision we took last year, then didn't use and released this year, that's about 0.2% of that. The balance is saving on publications. I'm sorry, not publications, it's a saving on some unproductive marketing we did last year. I apologize.\r\nWarehouse and distribution, adverse movement to 0.9%. Of that 0.9%, 0.2% of it is a result of wage inflation in the warehouses. The balance, 0.7%, is because the participation of our overseas business is growing, and that has much higher warehouse and distribution costs. Central overheads, same comment as retail, so overall up 0.3% and no erosion in Directory margins.\r\nDirectory margins for the full year, we're expecting to be sort of flattish as we are expecting retail margins taking off to be flattish as well. But long term, what you can see from this is that the growth in our overseas business and the decline in the credit business will, long term, put structural pressure on the net margins of Directory. So that's something you should put into your longer-term plans, which I know are much longer than our own, because you have much more complex spreadsheets that are much more exciting.\r\nSo moving on to the focus part of the presentation. And you'll notice this presentation is mercifully -- feels mercifully quick today, because I know you've got far more important companies to rush off and cover later on. So we'll be a little bit briefer today. I'm going to start with Directory credit.\r\nWe've already talked about the 7% increase in total customer base. That is made up of 2 things: 40% increase in our cash customers. These are customers that come onto the site and pay immediately using debit and credit cards. That number, just -- these are a little bit of a health warning, because it's quite -- it's harder to tell with cash customers whether it's the same customer returning or not.\r\nIf they've moved and come back with a different email address, then it's much harder to trace them back to the same thing than if they had an account where they tend to -- it's more obvious that they're restarting. So cash customers, very good growth, and this is about us reaching a whole other people who 10, 15 years ago wouldn't even have considered themselves to be mail order shoppers at all. The downside of that is that our credit customer base is eroding. It's running at a rate around 0.3%. It's important to understand the nature of that decline. It's not that our credit customers are leaving us in larger numbers. So if you look at the attrition rates, this is the percentage of the customer base that closes their account each year.\r\nWhat you can see is it actually has remained steady for the last 3 years and actually has declined in the current year. And we would expect -- as the base declines, we would expect the quality to improve, so that shouldn't come as a surprise. The thing that's holding the -- that's moving the credit business back is the number of new recruits. And what you see is a dramatic fall in number of new recruits into this year, and that's what's giving us our net fall. It's not quite as bad as it looks because credit sales are still growing, albeit margin. So the customers who remain with us are spending more on average.\r\nSo I don't think that, that credit sales increase running ahead of the declining base makes the problem any less. What it does do is probably delay the problem. It turns into sort of a less of an acute problem, more of a chronic problem for the Directory. The question is what can we do about it? We talked about this in the year-end results and 2 things: first is, 6 months ago, this is all we were doing to promote the account, pay on account or pay now. That was the only choice you got. We've done a whole lot of trials to promote the use of the account at point of order, both for first-time cash orders and when they come back to the site to reorder. We succeed -- that's had some moderate success. We've had credit take up move from around 7% of new starters to 14% of new starters. That is not enough to arrest the decline, and we'll -- it should slow it down a little bit, but it was not enough to arrest the decline in the customer base, and it's certainly not enough to grow it.\r\nAnd I think the thing that we have to realize as a business is that if the credit business is to grow, and we're not sure that it can, but if it is to grow, then it needs to fundamentally change and recognize that it isn't competing with old mail order-style accounts or even store cards. It's really got to compete with credit cards. And we started that process 6 months ago. As we said in our presentation in March, we reduced our minimum payments from 9.4%, which was unusually high, to 5%, which is at the top end of the credit card minimum payments. Credit card minimum payments tend to be between 2% and 5%. This, obviously, gives the customer greater flexibility and a sense of security as well that they're not going to -- they don't need to worry as much about their Directory account if, in any 1 month, they don't have so much money.\r\nWe have been really surprised by the effect that this has had because it hasn't just affected the customers who pay the minimum payment; it's affected virtually the whole base. And if you look at what happened to our balances, we introduced the change in February, and this is what happened to our credit balances since then. Around GBP 120 million of additional debt, and that is -- you'll remember, I said GBP 135 million additional debt earlier on, the GBP 15 million is driven by sales. This is driven by the change.\r\nWe think that, that will be around GBP 200 million by the end of the year. Now we won't panic for this. We thought it'd be between GBP 30 million and GBP 40 million. And obviously, the upside of this is that it gives us potentially an enormous increase in interest income.\r\nAnd we've been debating -- we've debated what to do with that. And obviously -- the obvious thing to do is to take it straight to profit. We think the right thing to do, both in terms of treating our customers fairly and in terms of making sure that the business stands a chance of growing in the long term, is to give the lion's share of that back to our customers through an APR reduction, so we intend to reduce the APR from 24.99% to 22.9%. It's still at a high rate, but it puts us in the credit card range. And remember, that it was 25.99% 18 months ago.\r\nJust to sort of give you a feel of where that sits in competitive terms. Home shopping, these are 5 major home shopping -- the 5 major home shopping account companies. Their interest rates range from around 30% to 41%. The one with the bar in between, they've got 2 rates, a high-risk rate and a low risk rate. Store card rates are running from between 20% to 30%. Again, 20% is only for low-risk customers. Credit card market running between somewhere 26% and 16%, 26% for high-risk customers, 16% for low-risk customers. Where that leaves our account, not super competitive for credit cards, but not completely out of the ballpark. And we think that, that gives it a chance of being competitive going forward.\r\nIn addition, when I come on to talk about the profitability, you'll see that there is a potential that we may have underestimated the profit from the additional GBP 200 million of debt. If we have, we intend to reinvest that at some point, probably in the middle of next year, in further interest rate reductions. Probably, we will look to differentiate between high-risk and low-risk customers, so that we'll be competitive at the low risk end. We think actually at the high risk end, we already are quite competitive at 22.9%. But we're looking at -- to be more competitive at the low risk end. So that's sort of the plan for business. But that does -- that is contingent on us making the profit on that.\r\nIn terms of profitability, just looking at the full year profit, GBP 200 million of debt, additional interest income at the previous rate of interest would have given us GBP 50 million of income. Bad debt provision at 6.5%. That is higher than we are currently experiencing on the whole base. And the reason we've taken that view is because we don't yet know what the effect of the minimum payments will be on bad debt. It may be that giving people longer to pay actually degrades the value -- degrades the quality of the debt, so we've been quite conservative about that.\r\nCost of funding, around -- we seeing the 4% cost of funding around the cost of our bonds, gives us a gross gain of GBP 29 million. An APR reduction of 2% will cost us GBP 19 million. It leaves the net profit of GBP 10 million, which is 5% on the GBP 200 million that we've invested. And in terms of return on capital, adding back the cost of funding, return on capital at 9%, which, not coincidentally, is 1% ahead of the rate in which -- of which we're prepared to buy back our shares. In terms of the effect in this year, we expect the net profit to be around -- the net profit effect to be around GBP 1 million in the current year.\r\nMoving on to retail wages. Obviously, this has been a subject of much discussion, comments. And I thought that this is -- there are 2 sections here. First of all, to talk about what NEXT has done with its wages, because I think we're slightly ahead of the curve, and the second is to talk about the effect of the living wage premium.\r\nIn terms of what we've done, this is a history of the national minimum wage. And this is what's -- what we've done with our starter rates. We started this journey about 2.5 years ago because we wanted to improve the quality of service that we had in the stores, and we recognized that in order to do that, we were going to have to increase our pay rates and change some of our terms and conditions.\r\nSo this is what's happened to pay rates. Pay rates have by -- in October, when the national minimum wage goes to GBP 6.70, our wage would go to GBP 7.04. That is before an average of 50p per hour bonus that we pay in customer service bonuses. So there is another -- in reality, there's another 50p to add to that.\r\nIn terms of increase on 2012, that's a 13% pay increase. As important, if not more important, we have changed the way we recruit and contract our staff. In the past, we've gone for very large numbers on small contracts in the belief that, that gives us flexibility, and it does to a certain extent give you flexibility. The problem is a lot of people working on low-hour contracts means that you have people who aren't particularly experienced, training is a big percentage of that total cost and they're less loyal to the business.\r\nThe other thing is that it doesn't give you the flexibility that at first, it might appear to, because the -- if you give someone a very low contract at hours per week, they're more likely to take on another job, which means they actually become less flexible. So we've moved significantly as through natural turnover, as people have left the business rather than recruit people to replace them, we have reallocated their hours across the staff base.\r\nAnd as a result of that -- sorry, I should say before that, you're wondering how is that funded, the 13% pay rise? Payroll as a percentage of sales in 2012 was 11.9%. You would expect, given a 13% increase in starter rates, that to go up to at least 12.5%, it's up to 12.8%. In fact, it's actually gone up by 0.2%. So the majority of this has been funded through productivity improvements, some of which I've bored you with in the past. There's no one big idea that that spans this [ph] lots and lots of small initiatives to improve productivity.\r\nBut coming back to hours. What we've done is increase hours by 26%, which means on average, the average member of staff is only 43% more with NEXT than they were 4 years ago. We think that gives us more experienced, better trained, better motivated and more loyal staff.\r\nIn terms of the living wage premium. It's taken us some time to get our heads around this. The Chancellor said 2 things: first of all, he said the living wage premium will be reaching 60% of the median earnings by 2020; and the other is that it was set to reach GBP 9 by 2020. And the first thing to understand is that those 2 things are not necessarily the same thing, in that it makes an assumption about what will happen to inflation in median wages between now and 2020.\r\nAnd what we've done is separate out the effect of the -- taking the living wage premium of 60% to the effect of inflation on general wages and the median itself. So in terms of analyzing that, national minimum wage, that's not our rate, the national minimum wage of GBP 6.70, that goes to GBP 7.20 next year. That will cost us around GBP 2 million in 2016.\r\nIn terms of taking that to the median, assuming no inflation in wages, that will go to GBP 7.85. So that would take it to GBP 7.85, and it's the assumed assumption which the OBR forecast to be around 4.5%. And if you want to read -- a fascinating read on this, try appendix B of the OBR's financial outlook -- July financial outlook document. It really is actually very interesting and worth reading, but that is the inflation that takes you from GBP 7.85 to GBP 9.35.\r\nSo there are 2 elements to this. There's a legislative element, which gets that GBP 7.85. An inflation element that takes it forecast to GBP 9.35. In order to get it to GBP 9, wage inflation would need to be 3.5% per annum in the median.\r\nIn terms of assessing the cost, the likely costs to NEXT, given the scenario set out by the OBR, this is how we've analyzed it. We take our staff wages of 2016 at GBP 7.20. That's 55% of the median. We then looked that the other levels of management in the business. And what you can see is that, I had to go from supervisor to junior manager, floor manager, store manager. As we progressed through the wage hierarchy, we are getting a sort of 9% to 10% wage differential at each level.\r\nIf that -- if the staff level goes to GBP 7.85, you can see there's only a 2p difference with the next manager up. What we've assumed for the purposes of our modeling is that we can compress the current 9%, 10% differential to around 7%. So this is assuming a 7% differential, which we think at these rates of pay should be enough to encourage people to take promotion.\r\nThat means the first level manager has to go up 6.7%, next one at 4.6%, 2.7% and at 0.5% manager. At around GBP 10.50, there's no further knock-on effect. In terms of the cost of that, the cost is around GBP 11 million. That includes our estimate of any subcontracted costs, where subcontractors are paying the -- are not yet paid the living wage premium.\r\nThe knock-on effect is surprisingly high at GBP 16 million. Most of that doesn't come from these managers. We would have to -- you all look at that and think we've got far too many managers if that were the case. The knock-on effect comes from the fact that more skilled jobs within the business, more skilled or more demanding jobs which are less attractive, currently have a 9%, 10% premium to our store wages, things like call center operatives. And we've assumed that those wages, that if a call center operative was on the same level as a junior supervisor, that their wages would have to rise by as much to attract them to that job rather than doing a shop drop. So that's why the knock-on effect is much higher than you might initially expect. Cost of that is GBP 27 million. So a lot of money, but in the scheme of things, it's not transformative.\r\nIf you then add on 4.5% inflation, it doesn't make any difference to the cost of the living wage premium. The orange and the green blocks remain exactly the same. But obviously, that 4.5% is a big cost because if you translate that across our wage bill, which is around GBP 600 million across the group, that adds another GBP 120 million of cost. So you're at GBP 147 million of additional cost to the group in 2020 if wage inflation comes through as expected.\r\nWhat you can see from that is that the living wage premium is a relatively small part of the total increase. In terms of the price rises required to pay for that, we estimate the price rise would need to be in the order of 6%. So -- of which 1% comes from the living wage premium.\r\nIncidentally, in case you're thinking, we would always choose to pass it through as price rather than take the cost hit, because if you take a cost hit of 104 [ph] -- if you do the math, the maths are overwhelming in favor of price rise. Because you say, take GBP 147 million as a percentage of our profits, that's around 18%. If you work out what sales would have to fall by to give us the same drop in profit, you're at a level that could not possibly be caused by a 6% price increase. So we were -- in the past, when we increased our prices by around 7% about 3, 4 years ago, when we had a big devaluation in the pound, and that adversely affected sales by about 1.5%.\r\nSo what you can see is that, given the choice, take the hit or pass it on, the maths are overwhelming in favor of passing on the cost, particularly if wages have risen by 4.5% per annum, because that 6% price increase needs to be taken in the context of a country where, on average, people are earning 19% and more.\r\nSo actually, in the OBR scenario, the effect of the living wage premium at GBP 27 million is not -- it's not welcome, but it's not unmanageable. The problem potentially comes if wage inflation falls below the 3.5% and the 60% median target is dropped and the GBP 9 target is maintained. Because once you start moving the living wage premium much above 60%, it begins to have 2 impacts, and it's worth just explaining back to our chart here. That increases wages by 2% compound to 2020. Our staff will then be paid GBP 7.79 and getting them to GBP 9 would be a 15.6% increase, and what you can see is rather than being paid 2p less than the first manager, they're actually paid 50p more. So the increase required here is far greater and so on and so forth until you get to manager 4.\r\nBut what you then realize is actually, hold on a second, this is now affecting manager 5 because manager 4 is at GBP 11.97 and manager 5, through inflation, will only get to GBP 11.93. So you have to begin to cascade the effects of the median wage further up the wage hierarchy.\r\nAnd there are 2 problems on this: one is that the cost of implementing this, obviously, increased dramatically. So from GBP 27 million, we estimate this would cost nearer GBP 70 million, and we think that is probably conservative.\r\nThe other problem, which is more serious for the wider economy, is that at that point, the median wage will be GBP 14. So you end up with a situation where raising the living wage to GBP 9 begins to move the median. And then you end up with a situation that all of you will be hugely familiar with, with your circular references in your spreadsheets, which you tend to just fudge. I know that we all do that. But you end up with this potential inflationary loop, where the living wage premium begins to move the target against which it's set.\r\nSo in summary on this, if wage inflation comes through as expected, or even if it comes through anywhere at or around 3.5%, we're not worried. If it comes through at less than 3.5%, we're still not worried if the target remains 60%. The only worry would be if the target remains GBP 9 and inflation comes through at significantly less than 3.5%. In that situation, costs escalate and price rises would be less easy to swallow. Wages would still be rising faster than prices, but those price rises become harder to swallow, which would have an adverse impact on sales, which means that the impact on profit would be significant. Is that -- now I've said it, it all sounds completely simple. But I think that's where we are on the living wage premium.\r\nIn terms of profit guidance. Full Price sales for the full year, 3.5% to 6%. We haven't -- we only gave this forecast in July. I haven't seen anything in trade that would suggest we should change that. Second half, we're expecting to be between 3.5% and 7.5%. That might sound ambitious with 5.5% at the midpoint. It's significantly better than the first half, but remember that the first half was 16% up on 2 years.\r\nIf you look at the second half on 2 years, it's only at 10%. And at that point, everyone in the room moves from thinking, these guys are wild optimists to actually -- they are being too conservative on their sales estimates for the second half. We think this number is right. 2 years ago, it was a bad summer and a good Christmas. If you look at these numbers against 3 years ago, both come out exactly at 19%. So we think that these numbers are realistic. \r\nFull year -- full price sales, we're forecasting to be up GBP 160 million. And just we wanted to update you as to how we expect -- where we expect that growth to come from the first -- from the estimates we gave in the first half, lower than we originally forecast a drop in like-for-like sales, roughly same amount from New space. \r\nNEXT online, biggest winner in our forecast from GBP 10 million to GBP 50 million. LABEL around GBP 30 million, that's GBP 10 million less than we were expecting, but still a 20% increase in full price sales. Overseas, GBP 40 million, which is pretty much in line with our initial estimates.\r\nIn terms of where that leaves profit. Profit growth, we think, will be somewhere between 2.9% and 8%. Layer on top of that ordinary dividend yield of 2.2%, special dividend yield of 3.3% and that's based on GBP 72.33, which was the share price at the beginning of the year, gives total shareholder return of growth in earnings plus dividend somewhere between 8.4% and 13.5%, which, in the context of a very difficult first half, we think is respectable.\r\nAnd on that note, I'm going to finish. I think that is, for me, a record in terms of speed.",

      "transcript_text1": "Welcome to this telephone conference on the occasion of H&M's 9-month results 2015. With me is our CFO, Jyrki Tervonen, and we'll be happy to answer your questions after the presentation. You'll find the presentation slides to this telephone conference on hm.com.\r\nH&M continued to perform well in the first 9 months of 2015, both in terms the sales and profits. Our collections were well received for all group brands. We continued our successful expansion with stores and online, and we kept taking market share. As our offering is reaching more and more customers every day, we're also developing and improving our ranges in order to make our offering even better. This summer, for example, we launched our new concept H&M Beauty, and it has got off to a very good start. We also continue investing long term in areas such as IT and online to further strengthen the H&M Group and secure future expansion.\r\nPlease turn to the slide Sales. In the first 9 months of the year, sales including VAT reached SEK 153 million, an increase of 12% in local currencies and 21% in SEK, which is a good proof that our collections are well appreciated worldwide. In the third quarter, sales increased by 11% in local currencies. Translating to SEK, sales including VAT amounted to SEK 53.4 billion, an increase of 18% compared to last year. Sales were strong in June and July. But in August, sales were negatively affected by the unseasonably warm weather in many of our large European markets. We also met a strong comparable with growth of 19% in August 2014. Looking at the month of September, the weather has become more normal. And in the period of the first -- the 22nd September, sales increased by 12% in local currencies compared to the same period last year. \r\nAnd now to look at results, please turn to the next slide. Gross profit in the third quarter was SEK 25.7 billion. That corresponds to a gross margin of 55.9% compared to 58.3% last year. The combined effect on the purchasing costs from the external factors remained negative. This is mainly due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Markdowns in relation to sales increased by 30 basis points compared to the third quarter last year mostly due to the increased price activities in August. For the 9-month period, gross profit amounted to SEK 75.2 billion with a gross margin of 56.9%.\r\nPlease turn to the slide SG&A. Cost control in the group remains good. In the third quarter, selling and administration costs increased by 20% in SEK to SEK 18.8 billion. In local currencies, the increase was 12%. The increase in SG&A is mainly related to the expansion and the long-term investments.\r\nTo look at profits, please turn to the next slide. Profits developed well in the first 9 months of the year. Although in the third quarter, profits were negatively affected by the transaction effect on the strong U.S. dollar on purchasing costs. Higher costs for our long-term investments also impacted profits negatively, as did the weak August sales and the subsequent rise in markdowns due to the unseasonably warm weather. In the third quarter, profit after financial items was at the same level as last year at SEK 6.9 billion. And in the 9-month period, profit after financial items increased by 11% to SEK 20 billion. \r\nPlease turn to the table sales and profit. With an estimated tax rate of 23.5%, tax amounted to SEK 1.6 billion in the third quarter. Net profit thus was SEK 5.3 billion, equaling earnings per share of SEK 3.21, largely unchanged from the third quarter last year. In the 9-month period, net profit increased by 12% to SEK 15.4 billion. This equals an EPS of SEK 9.29, up from SEK 8.31 last year.\r\nAnd now for some other key data, please turn to the next slide. Stock-in-trade on the 31st August amounted to SEK 25.2 billion, an increase of 40% in SEK. In local currencies, the increase was 38%. While the reported increase in the stock-in-trade is high, both the composition and the level of the stock-in-trade are considered good with higher proportion of new garments compared to the same time last year. The increase in stock-in-trade is explained mainly by the value increase caused by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and also by the store and online expansion. Also, a large part of the increase in stock-in-trade, more precisely SEK 1.2 billion, is due to a bookkeeping effect arising from our previously communicated change in the process around invoice management for sourcing.\r\nCash flow from current operations was SEK 17.8 billion compared to SEK 18 billion. And investments in terms of CapEx totaled SEK 7.9 billion for the first 9 months of the year compared with SEK 6.4 billion in the same period last year. Investments covered mainly new stores, but also IT and logistics. For 2015 as a whole, CapEx is still expected to reach approximately 11 point -- to SEK 11.5 billion based on exchange rates from the 30th of November 2014. The financial position of the H&M Group remains strong. Liquid funds were SEK 11 billion compared to SEK 13.5 billion. Return on equity was 44.7% compared to 46.1%.\r\nAnd now for some comments on expansion, please look at the slide, Store Expansion. H&M's strong expansion continues. The plan for 2015 remains intact, meaning approximately 400 new stores net. The largest expansion is taking place in existing markets, with China and the U.S. being the largest expansion markets. We added 164 new stores net in the first 9 months of the year, bringing the total numbers of stores to 3,675 stores at the end of the third quarter. This means that we will open around 240 new stores net in the fourth quarter alone.\r\nWe're adding 5 new H&M markets this year. Taiwan, Peru and Macau have already opened, and all have had a very good start. In October, we will open the first H&M stores in India and South Africa. The first store in India will open in the Select Citywalk mall in New Delhi. And in South Africa, the first store will open in Cape Town in the V&A Waterfront. Today, we also announced 3 new H&M markets for next year: New Zealand, Cyprus and Puerto Rico.\r\nAnd now some words on our other group brands, please turn to the next slide. Expansion continues for COS, & Other Stories, Monki, Weekday and Cheap Monday. In 2015, expansion focuses mostly on & Other Stories and COS. COS will add 4 new markets this year. Bahrain opened their franchise in February, Luxembourg, Hungary and Canada are planning to open this autumn. COS will open in the Czech Republic in 2016.\r\nPlease turn to the next slide. In parallel to our rapid store expansion, we're also adding e-commerce in a growing number of markets. H&M's online store, hm.com is opening in 10 new markets in 2015. Eight of them had opened already, it's Portugal, Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania, Croatia, Hungary, Bulgaria and Belgium, and customer reception has been great in all of these markets. With the addition of Switzerland and Russia this autumn, H&M will be available online in 23 markets by the end of this financial year. In 2016, the plan is to offer e-commerce in a further 9 existing H&M markets. These markets are Ireland, Japan, Greece, Croatia, Slovenia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Luxembourg. \r\nWe also continue to broaden the H&M product range. Please turn to the slide H&M Beauty. In July, we began the launch of our new concept, H&M Beauty, which is now available in 700 stores across 28 markets and online. Following a very good start, we will continue to roll out H&M Beauty to more stores. Already by the end of November, H&M Beauty will be available in the total of approximately 900 stores in 42 markets and online. We're also developing other new concepts and brands, which we will communicate more on at a later date.\r\nAnd now before we move on to the Q&A session, just some words on current development. We have an exciting fashion season ahead of us. And like we said initially, sales in the first 2 weeks of September were up 12%. Meanwhile, if we look at market conditions regarding sourcing as the U.S. dollar strengthens further during the sourcing period to the fourth quarter, purchasing costs for the fourth quarter have been even more negatively affected than the purchasing cost for the third quarter. As always, we're continuously reviewing our customer offering in each market, and we are monitoring the market closely to ensure that we offer the best combination of fashion, quality, price and sustainability.\r\nAnd now we're happy to take your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.",

[Operator Instructions] Thank you.",
      "transcript_text3": "I've got 2 questions. The first one is about current trading. Are there any calendar effects in the final week of September that we need to take account of, please?\n\n---\n\nNo, there is no major calendar impact in September.\n\n---\n\nA couple of questions. Firstly, what was your average selling price at the beginning of September '15 versus the beginning of September '14, please? And my second question is, given sort of the slight weakness in the renminbi and a bit of time on your side, have you managed to mitigate some of these further pressures in the fourth quarter sort of COGS outlook?\n\n---\n\nAgain Rebecca, I'd like to remind you, please one question at a time. It's easier for everyone. But I do remember your first question was regarding ASP. And unfortunately, we do not -- for competitive reasons, we do not comment the ASP. Sorry.\n\n---\n\nAnd what's next, the second question?\n\n---\n\nJust with the -- with a bit of time on your side, have you managed to mitigate any of these U.S. dollar-related pressures in the COGS as we go into the fourth quarter and into the first half of 2016?\n\n---\n\nOf course, when we're looking at the U.S. dollar effect for the purchases we have done for Q4, as Nils previously said, it's even a more negative effect for those purchases. And we are always looking to different ways of mitigating negative FX. But exactly how we are working with our pricing, et cetera, that we will always keep to ourselves for competitive reasons. But always, as we have said, we are always looking into finding efficiencies and changing sourcing market, et cetera.\n\n---\n\nI do have 3 questions, but they are very short. One at a time.  So the first one on Russia. Given I've seen some significant growth there, I wonder what is the composition between price and volume, have you raised prices in Russia?\n\n---\n\nRussia, we're very happy with Russia. And as we say, we do very well, and we continue to expand. We're also very happy to launch e-commerce already this autumn. And regarding pricing effects, we don't want to give too much details because what happened last year, especially was that the ruble depreciated quite substantially towards most other currencies. And I would say every retailer had to compensate and increase prices. And we have also adjusted, but we say less probably than the rest of the market and thus increased our competitive advantage even further.\n\n---\n\nOkay, very helpful. And then on China, on a more negative note there. If we try to decompose some sort of like-for-like, these have been negative. But understandably, you do grow stores quite rapidly there. Given that you do operate online, does it come maybe to a surprise of the existing store base is not as productive maybe? Or this is in line with your budget in the past about China?\n\n---\n\nWe continue to expand very rapid in China. We're very happy with the development and also the profitability. And we launched e-commerce as late as last year, last autumn. And then, of course, from quarter-to-quarter, there'll always be volatilities. So no concern really for the numbers in China. I would say, the contrary, we look -- there's a huge potential. We'll continue to expand very rapidly this autumn, this quarter. So we really are optimistic for the future going on in China.\n\n---\n\nOf course, in Q3, if you compare to Q2, yes, the local growth is less than in Q2 for sure. But we are still on a good level when it comes to the turnover and the profitability. So we are, as Nils said, continuing our rapid expansion in the Chinese market.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And last one on the 4Q store openings. So in 4Q, you're going to open close -- store number in order to hit your 400, which is close to the number that you opened the entire 2011. And we'd -- so it is the highest in a quarter historically by quite some amount. Are there any concerns that you have that -- should we be thinking that maybe the locations are being compromised or it just happens to be timing issue from Q3 to Q4 and it's been as usual? What I'm trying to get to -- sorry, and that is a longer-than-I-thought question. What I'm trying to get to is to realize how you're planning went on because it is an extraordinary amount of new stores that you're opening, and I wonder whether there are any profit implications even in the near term.\n\n---\n\nWhen it comes to -- if we are compromising when it comes to store location or terms, we never compromise on those. We have always sticked to have a high quality of the best a, location and good terms, flexible terms. Some years, it happens. We usually are very heavy the second half year and Q4 as well. And so they are, as you said, business as usual. Yes, it's a huge amount of stores that we're going to open, but we have fantastic teams in the countries. And we are quite confident that we'll open stores in due time, and that will be very good stores contributing to our portfolio.\n\n---\n\nI have a question about the comment in the release this morning that you're looking into launching other new concepts and brands and that you will come back to it at a later date on this. From that, should we think that your long-term investments that are now getting very, very long term are going to continue into next year and perhaps at an even higher level than currently? I suppose what I'm asking is, when might shareholders expect your EBIT margins to stop falling, which is just a continuum at the moment.\n\n---\n\nYes, at this moment, of course, the main impact on the EBIT margin is the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and the [indiscernible]. But when it comes to the long-term investment, yes, we are looking into some very interesting new ideas, and we are comfortable that they will make us much stronger in the future. But of course, it will -- I mean that long-term investments will most probably continue next year. They will. But exactly if they are increasing or staying on the same level, that we have to come back to in connection with the year-end reporting. But for sure, there are new ideas coming up.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And could I just ask half an extra question?\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nYour comments around Chris's question on the level of openings in the fourth quarter, would you have already taken quite a lot of preopening costs in the P&L in the 9-month period? I suppose the slight concern is with so many openings, is this going to hit your SG&A on a like-for-like basis in a big way in Q4?\n\n---\n\nYes, of course. It's not exactly that all the costs will be in Q4. A lot of cost is already in there within the 9 months. There are, of course, coming up costs up there. It's more or less in the same pace as we have every year. So there shouldn't be such a dramatical changes.\n\n---\n\nI have a question about the currency. Clearly, you've indicated that the pressure is greater in the fourth quarter. If current exchange rates are maintained, when is the worst quarter for you? Is it Q4 or is Q1 even tougher?\n\n---\n\nWell, still we have a lot of purchases to be done for Q1. So we don't know whether the U.S. dollar will be ahead of us. But I would say that if the currency rates are more or less on this level, I would guess that the impact on purchases prices in Q1 is more or less the same as in Q4.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then the second question is that your CapEx guidance is given on a legacy exchange rate. Clearly, your openings are not necessarily weighted to your existing revenue or OpEx exposure. Could you help us by trying to translate that guidance into SEK at current exchange rates?\n\n---\n\nYes. We have to come back to that. But you are correct where we guide for SEK 11 billion to SEK 11.5 billion, as we disclosed. It's the year-end closing date rates that we are referring. So of course, it can be more when we are translated to average rate as we're doing in the P&L. So for sure, that's an effect. But let's come back to that effect because we have 240 net stores to open, it's quite the huge amount to still open. So it will be a much clearer picture when we have opened all those stores.\n\n---\n\nAnd then my final question is, trying to disaggregate your revenue growth by country or region and adjusting for space, it appears your Southern European business has been performing a lot better than Germany and some of the other Northern European markets. Do you think that, that is a consumer phenomenon or particularly around the weather in Q3?\n\n---\n\nI think it's a combination. And as we've been stating now for more than a year, we've seen positive signs in the macro in those markets. And we've seen very strong development, and it continues. But also, I think that, I mean, the offerings we have had, had been very well received, and we have very strong teams in place.\n\n---\n\nYes, I would say looking just purely on the Q3 figures, it's a mix. It's a mix. As we state in August, we were hit much more in the northern parts of Europe. We performed well in the southern parts. And as Nils said, the macro in many countries in South Europe, especially when looking at the Spanish macros where the unemployment rate is going down quite quickly, so there are good macros also in South Europe.\n\n---\n\nGiven renewed bouts of volatility with emerging market currencies, are there any markets where you have a material number of rentals that are not in local currency?\n\n---\n\nNo, no.\n\n---\n\nNo, no. Most of the rents are in their local currencies.\n\n---\n\nSo particularly in Russia, I suppose is the obvious one to think about there, you don't have any dollar or euro rents there?\n\n---\n\nNo, the vast majority is strictly in rubles and also good terms with the turnover and et cetera.\n\n---\n\nRight. And just following on from that. Given the kind of weakness in terms of currencies and demand, does this change your view about the pace of acceleration to some of these markets that actually now might be quite a good time in some of these markets where you're not -- you don't have a very substantial commitment to some emerging markets?\n\n---\n\nYes and no. I mean, we always have a long-term view. And as you say, in difficult macro situation with our long-term view and strong financials, there might be opportunities for us to expand even further, yes.\n\n---\n\nCan I just ask you, you talked in last quarter of discussing internally at least a change, the longer-term target or guidance that you give every year to open 10% to 15% new stores. Could you elaborate on how those discussions are going and the reasoning behind the alternatives and what they are, please?\n\n---\n\nYes. It's -- well, nothing new. We have been discussing the relevance of the existing targets of 10% to 15% stores, because today with online and there's -- and the different formats we have and franchise, et cetera, it doesn't become so relevant anymore. But the most important thing is that we are not planning to slow down. The ambition to grow remains. But we haven't decided yet how to -- what target to use, so to speak.\n\n---\n\nYes, it could be that we are continuing with the 10% to 15%. But as Nils said with online, different concepts, et cetera, it's getting more irrelevant as a figure to talk about stores. And then, of course, there are different options if we are speaking to increase in sales per year or maybe not to have any fixed financial KPI, but still communicating in a way that the market understands that we are continuing with our high expansion rate and with the continued high profitability and good financial position. So we are looking into different solutions and suggestions and we're also looking into what the other peers, competitors, how they are communicating. And so but we haven't decided yet what the outcome will be. So but still, internally, we will -- regardless what the end result will be, so regardless that, we will internally, of course, work as we have done with really very clear goals when it comes to store openings, expansion, profitability, et cetera.\n\n---\n\nCould I also ask you, I think you've indicated that your net dollar flow is at the range of 35 billion to 40 billion every year, and that's just according to our estimates that, theoretically or mathematically in a static assumption, the gross margin should have been down by SEK 4 billion in Q3 or 400 basis points at least. Now obviously adjusting for the markdown effect, there's \"only\" about a 200 basis points fall. Could you let us in on what were the main drivers that had an impact on sort of the actual outcome versus the static and mathematical effect, please?\n\n---\n\nYes, okay. The static or mathematical or theoretical effect is, of course, one thing. But the reality, how we are buying, it's not exactly as we have been talking several times that we try to give you a guidance in what direction the purchase prices are going by saying, okay, look, approx 2 quarters back for those garments that we are selling in Q3, et cetera. But in reality, we are not always buying in that pattern. We buy sometimes even earlier of some basic garments, or we have lead times within 3, 4 week. So it's a mixture. So the realities and the mathematical result will give as you calculated the -- was it like SEK 4 billion on a base of SEK 40 billion to SEK 50 billion, I hope you [indiscernible]. So that's one way of looking to it. And of course, the mathematical results will be as you have calculated, but the reality when we are buying exactly to which currencies and the selling patterns ahead. So it will be a different result than the mathematical or theoretical. But there are, of course, always things that we try to mitigate. But we will always speak to our business concept and thinking long term and start from the customer offering.\n\n---\n\nSo in short, what you're telling us is that the main reason for that, the starting model doesn't work in this case, is that there's too many differences in lead times in sourcing. It's not pricing or cost of goods, but it's lead times. Is that a fair...\n\n---\n\nThere are so many different factors affecting our gross margins as we have been talking, it's like 20, 25 different factors affecting the gross margin. And we don't want to elaborate and go into each of these. We give you some major factors behind it, those 4, 5 macro factors that we have been talking about. But otherwise, we don't want to elaborate what the gross margins build up. And we understand that you are keen to know. But with respect, we don't want to give it away to our competitors. We don't have any pattern. So we really want to speak that and have that information for us, only for us, sorry.\n\n---\n\nNice, simple one for me. In terms of your new store formats that you're introducing, both the existing ones where you're rolling them out and the new ones that you're developing, can you remind us of the rationale as to why you felt it was necessary to move beyond the core H&M brand, please?\n\n---\n\nIt's very simple. I mean, there's so much -- many opportunities. It's a way to reach a broader customer base, of course. And also, we can capitalize on existing and backbone infrastructure, logistics, sourcing, et cetera. I think, the success so far of the, for example, COS, & Other Stories are very good proofs of that the model, the rationale works.\n\n---\n\nSo as this proportion expands over time, your business model is becoming increasingly complex. Do you think there's more that you could do to help our understanding of how the company looks, how it's developing, what the different drivers, the different concepts are? Because from the outside that it's becoming -- we're simplistically looking at a very increasingly complex business.\n\n---\n\nTrue. But for us, luckily, there are so many opportunities. And we -- our ambition will be very long term, and we want to development the company further. And luckily we -- our target is not to sell shares, as you know.\n\n---\n\nAnd when it comes to the complexity of the business, of course, it's getting more complicated with different brands, different channels, et cetera. But if we speak to what Nils said that we see a lot of opportunities, we have the H&M brand, we have the COS, we have Stories, we have Monki and Weekday, et cetera. So clearly, we can see that we are finding a potential in the market for those. We see new customers or even same customers, but asking for a different kind of fashion. So I think we are just finding the opportunities and investing and taking care of those opportunities that we identify in the market that we are doing something better than the existing markets for those brands. So that's the whole idea. And of course, we have said that we are investing a lot in building up the new formats. But I think we see that COS is performing very well, also Stories. But for Stories, it's still in the beginning, and we have still a lot of work to do.\n\n---\n\nSo it's more to do with -- not that there's a lack of opportunities for the core H&M brand in your existing markets, but you can see additional opportunities with other brands?\n\n---\n\nExactly.\n\n---\n\nI think they are complementing each other very well.\n\n---\n\nMy question is about the U.S. In the release and previous release, you noted that the U.S. is your largest opportunities for store growth from here. In just thinking about you have over 380 stores in the U.S. today, what do you think the right number of H&M stores is in that market? Obviously, we've seen some U.S. retailers start to reduce store numbers. So I'm just wondering where do you think the cap is?\n\n---\n\nWe refrain from giving such numbers. We stick to the fact that there's still lot of potential for us, and we're very happy with the development momentum we have in the U.S. both for our stores and also online.\n\n---\n\nCould you just -- coming back to more short-term trading, could you just comment whether there's been any sort of spillover from weather impacts in August into September or whether there any specific drags on short-term trading that you're seeing?\n\n---\n\nIt's always very difficult to tell. And as always, we say that you shouldn't focus too much on the month number. You should look at it over a season. And again September, we're quite pleased, 12% is okay. It's about the rate we've had for the year in local currencies.\n\n---\n\nIt's actually Geoff Ruddell of Morgan Stanley. Just a quick question. Obviously, August is very difficult because of the weather, and you, therefore, exited the quarter with, I imagine, a lot more stock you intended. I think stock was up about 40% year-on-year. My question is when does the -- when will you be taking the markdown for that? Because presumably a lot of that markdown hasn't actually occurred during this quarter.\n\n---\n\nWell, when looking at the stock, we consider both the level and the composition of the stock to be on a good level. That increase that you mentioned, 40% in Swedish krona and 38% in local currencies, it's mainly explained by the strong dollar that has made our purchasing cost much higher. And as we book the stock-in-trade at cost, it will affect the stock. And there, of course, our normal expansion in the increase and then the change in the handling of other supply invoices. But when we are looking at the stock level and the composition, we consider it as good. But just actually looking at that, we are not so afraid of the markdowns. But it's far too early to say about the markdowns in Q4, because we still have over 2 months to go.\n\n---\n\nSo you don't have any significant excess of summer stock leftover?\n\n---\n\nNo.\n\n---\n\nActually, as we indicated, we have more [indiscernible] garments in the stock that we have compared to the same time last year.\n\n---\n\nTwo big questions on my side. Just on the first one. Can you tell us what will be the full year currency benefit on the revenues at the current FX schedule? You're currently running at 10% for the first 9 months. Just wondering if you could give us any view on that one?\n\n---\n\nYou mean the translation effect?\n\n---\n\nTranslation effect, yes. That's good.\n\n---\n\nI'm sorry, we don't have any of such guidance. No, we don't, sorry.\n\n---\n\nOkay, great. And the second question. Just want to understand. On Sweden, you closed 5 stores in the third quarter, it's just a timing issue as you're relocating the stores or the number has primarily come down from 177 to 172?\n\n---\n\nYes, I mean, we always, when we look at the stores, we relocate and sometimes we close them when we come to the end of the contract. So that's quite normal. And as an investor, you shouldn't be worried because we normally typically don't close down profitable and successful stores.\n\n---\n\nYes. Sorry, one very quick one. In the -- can you give us the amount of stores that you have in the 22nd of September?\n\n---\n\nNo. We don't have that number in front of us, but we will give you the number by the end of September when we give you the full month sales numbers on the 15th of October, right?\n\n---\n\nSorry, my question has just been asked by Chris, which you're not answering. Thank you.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Thank you all very much for participating in this conference call. And welcome back for the full year result on the 28th of January next year. Bye.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Anne Critchlow (Analysts)】\nI've got 2 questions. The first one is about current trading. Are there any calendar effects in the final week of September that we need to take account of, please?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nNo, there is no major calendar impact in September.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rebecca McClellan (Analysts)】\nA couple of questions. Firstly, what was your average selling price at the beginning of September '15 versus the beginning of September '14, please? And my second question is, given sort of the slight weakness in the renminbi and a bit of time on your side, have you managed to mitigate some of these further pressures in the fourth quarter sort of COGS outlook?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nAgain Rebecca, I'd like to remind you, please one question at a time. It's easier for everyone. But I do remember your first question was regarding ASP. And unfortunately, we do not -- for competitive reasons, we do not comment the ASP. Sorry.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nAnd what's next, the second question?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rebecca McClellan (Analysts)】\nJust with the -- with a bit of time on your side, have you managed to mitigate any of these U.S. dollar-related pressures in the COGS as we go into the fourth quarter and into the first half of 2016?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nOf course, when we're looking at the U.S. dollar effect for the purchases we have done for Q4, as Nils previously said, it's even a more negative effect for those purchases. And we are always looking to different ways of mitigating negative FX. But exactly how we are working with our pricing, et cetera, that we will always keep to ourselves for competitive reasons. But always, as we have said, we are always looking into finding efficiencies and changing sourcing market, et cetera.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chris Chaviaras (Analysts)】\nI do have 3 questions, but they are very short. One at a time.  So the first one on Russia. Given I've seen some significant growth there, I wonder what is the composition between price and volume, have you raised prices in Russia?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nRussia, we're very happy with Russia. And as we say, we do very well, and we continue to expand. We're also very happy to launch e-commerce already this autumn. And regarding pricing effects, we don't want to give too much details because what happened last year, especially was that the ruble depreciated quite substantially towards most other currencies. And I would say every retailer had to compensate and increase prices. And we have also adjusted, but we say less probably than the rest of the market and thus increased our competitive advantage even further.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chris Chaviaras (Analysts)】\nOkay, very helpful. And then on China, on a more negative note there. If we try to decompose some sort of like-for-like, these have been negative. But understandably, you do grow stores quite rapidly there. Given that you do operate online, does it come maybe to a surprise of the existing store base is not as productive maybe? Or this is in line with your budget in the past about China?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nWe continue to expand very rapid in China. We're very happy with the development and also the profitability. And we launched e-commerce as late as last year, last autumn. And then, of course, from quarter-to-quarter, there'll always be volatilities. So no concern really for the numbers in China. I would say, the contrary, we look -- there's a huge potential. We'll continue to expand very rapidly this autumn, this quarter. So we really are optimistic for the future going on in China.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nOf course, in Q3, if you compare to Q2, yes, the local growth is less than in Q2 for sure. But we are still on a good level when it comes to the turnover and the profitability. So we are, as Nils said, continuing our rapid expansion in the Chinese market.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chris Chaviaras (Analysts)】\nOkay. And last one on the 4Q store openings. So in 4Q, you're going to open close -- store number in order to hit your 400, which is close to the number that you opened the entire 2011. And we'd -- so it is the highest in a quarter historically by quite some amount. Are there any concerns that you have that -- should we be thinking that maybe the locations are being compromised or it just happens to be timing issue from Q3 to Q4 and it's been as usual? What I'm trying to get to -- sorry, and that is a longer-than-I-thought question. What I'm trying to get to is to realize how you're planning went on because it is an extraordinary amount of new stores that you're opening, and I wonder whether there are any profit implications even in the near term.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nWhen it comes to -- if we are compromising when it comes to store location or terms, we never compromise on those. We have always sticked to have a high quality of the best a, location and good terms, flexible terms. Some years, it happens. We usually are very heavy the second half year and Q4 as well. And so they are, as you said, business as usual. Yes, it's a huge amount of stores that we're going to open, but we have fantastic teams in the countries. And we are quite confident that we'll open stores in due time, and that will be very good stores contributing to our portfolio.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Fraser Ramzan (Analysts)】\nI have a question about the comment in the release this morning that you're looking into launching other new concepts and brands and that you will come back to it at a later date on this. From that, should we think that your long-term investments that are now getting very, very long term are going to continue into next year and perhaps at an even higher level than currently? I suppose what I'm asking is, when might shareholders expect your EBIT margins to stop falling, which is just a continuum at the moment.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nYes, at this moment, of course, the main impact on the EBIT margin is the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and the [indiscernible]. But when it comes to the long-term investment, yes, we are looking into some very interesting new ideas, and we are comfortable that they will make us much stronger in the future. But of course, it will -- I mean that long-term investments will most probably continue next year. They will. But exactly if they are increasing or staying on the same level, that we have to come back to in connection with the year-end reporting. But for sure, there are new ideas coming up.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Fraser Ramzan (Analysts)】\nOkay. And could I just ask half an extra question?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Fraser Ramzan (Analysts)】\nYour comments around Chris's question on the level of openings in the fourth quarter, would you have already taken quite a lot of preopening costs in the P&L in the 9-month period? I suppose the slight concern is with so many openings, is this going to hit your SG&A on a like-for-like basis in a big way in Q4?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nYes, of course. It's not exactly that all the costs will be in Q4. A lot of cost is already in there within the 9 months. There are, of course, coming up costs up there. It's more or less in the same pace as we have every year. So there shouldn't be such a dramatical changes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charlie Muir-Sands (Analysts)】\nI have a question about the currency. Clearly, you've indicated that the pressure is greater in the fourth quarter. If current exchange rates are maintained, when is the worst quarter for you? Is it Q4 or is Q1 even tougher?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nWell, still we have a lot of purchases to be done for Q1. So we don't know whether the U.S. dollar will be ahead of us. But I would say that if the currency rates are more or less on this level, I would guess that the impact on purchases prices in Q1 is more or less the same as in Q4.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charlie Muir-Sands (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then the second question is that your CapEx guidance is given on a legacy exchange rate. Clearly, your openings are not necessarily weighted to your existing revenue or OpEx exposure. Could you help us by trying to translate that guidance into SEK at current exchange rates?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nYes. We have to come back to that. But you are correct where we guide for SEK 11 billion to SEK 11.5 billion, as we disclosed. It's the year-end closing date rates that we are referring. So of course, it can be more when we are translated to average rate as we're doing in the P&L. So for sure, that's an effect. But let's come back to that effect because we have 240 net stores to open, it's quite the huge amount to still open. So it will be a much clearer picture when we have opened all those stores.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charlie Muir-Sands (Analysts)】\nAnd then my final question is, trying to disaggregate your revenue growth by country or region and adjusting for space, it appears your Southern European business has been performing a lot better than Germany and some of the other Northern European markets. Do you think that, that is a consumer phenomenon or particularly around the weather in Q3?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nI think it's a combination. And as we've been stating now for more than a year, we've seen positive signs in the macro in those markets. And we've seen very strong development, and it continues. But also, I think that, I mean, the offerings we have had, had been very well received, and we have very strong teams in place.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nYes, I would say looking just purely on the Q3 figures, it's a mix. It's a mix. As we state in August, we were hit much more in the northern parts of Europe. We performed well in the southern parts. And as Nils said, the macro in many countries in South Europe, especially when looking at the Spanish macros where the unemployment rate is going down quite quickly, so there are good macros also in South Europe.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Simon Irwin (Analysts)】\nGiven renewed bouts of volatility with emerging market currencies, are there any markets where you have a material number of rentals that are not in local currency?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nNo, no.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nNo, no. Most of the rents are in their local currencies.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Simon Irwin (Analysts)】\nSo particularly in Russia, I suppose is the obvious one to think about there, you don't have any dollar or euro rents there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nNo, the vast majority is strictly in rubles and also good terms with the turnover and et cetera.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Simon Irwin (Analysts)】\nRight. And just following on from that. Given the kind of weakness in terms of currencies and demand, does this change your view about the pace of acceleration to some of these markets that actually now might be quite a good time in some of these markets where you're not -- you don't have a very substantial commitment to some emerging markets?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nYes and no. I mean, we always have a long-term view. And as you say, in difficult macro situation with our long-term view and strong financials, there might be opportunities for us to expand even further, yes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Nicklas Fhärm (Analysts)】\nCan I just ask you, you talked in last quarter of discussing internally at least a change, the longer-term target or guidance that you give every year to open 10% to 15% new stores. Could you elaborate on how those discussions are going and the reasoning behind the alternatives and what they are, please?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nYes. It's -- well, nothing new. We have been discussing the relevance of the existing targets of 10% to 15% stores, because today with online and there's -- and the different formats we have and franchise, et cetera, it doesn't become so relevant anymore. But the most important thing is that we are not planning to slow down. The ambition to grow remains. But we haven't decided yet how to -- what target to use, so to speak.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nYes, it could be that we are continuing with the 10% to 15%. But as Nils said with online, different concepts, et cetera, it's getting more irrelevant as a figure to talk about stores. And then, of course, there are different options if we are speaking to increase in sales per year or maybe not to have any fixed financial KPI, but still communicating in a way that the market understands that we are continuing with our high expansion rate and with the continued high profitability and good financial position. So we are looking into different solutions and suggestions and we're also looking into what the other peers, competitors, how they are communicating. And so but we haven't decided yet what the outcome will be. So but still, internally, we will -- regardless what the end result will be, so regardless that, we will internally, of course, work as we have done with really very clear goals when it comes to store openings, expansion, profitability, et cetera.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Nicklas Fhärm (Analysts)】\nCould I also ask you, I think you've indicated that your net dollar flow is at the range of 35 billion to 40 billion every year, and that's just according to our estimates that, theoretically or mathematically in a static assumption, the gross margin should have been down by SEK 4 billion in Q3 or 400 basis points at least. Now obviously adjusting for the markdown effect, there's \"only\" about a 200 basis points fall. Could you let us in on what were the main drivers that had an impact on sort of the actual outcome versus the static and mathematical effect, please?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nYes, okay. The static or mathematical or theoretical effect is, of course, one thing. But the reality, how we are buying, it's not exactly as we have been talking several times that we try to give you a guidance in what direction the purchase prices are going by saying, okay, look, approx 2 quarters back for those garments that we are selling in Q3, et cetera. But in reality, we are not always buying in that pattern. We buy sometimes even earlier of some basic garments, or we have lead times within 3, 4 week. So it's a mixture. So the realities and the mathematical result will give as you calculated the -- was it like SEK 4 billion on a base of SEK 40 billion to SEK 50 billion, I hope you [indiscernible]. So that's one way of looking to it. And of course, the mathematical results will be as you have calculated, but the reality when we are buying exactly to which currencies and the selling patterns ahead. So it will be a different result than the mathematical or theoretical. But there are, of course, always things that we try to mitigate. But we will always speak to our business concept and thinking long term and start from the customer offering.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Nicklas Fhärm (Analysts)】\nSo in short, what you're telling us is that the main reason for that, the starting model doesn't work in this case, is that there's too many differences in lead times in sourcing. It's not pricing or cost of goods, but it's lead times.

We don't have any pattern. So we really want to speak that and have that information for us, only for us, sorry.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Adam Cochrane (Analysts)】\nNice, simple one for me. In terms of your new store formats that you're introducing, both the existing ones where you're rolling them out and the new ones that you're developing, can you remind us of the rationale as to why you felt it was necessary to move beyond the core H&M brand, please?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nIt's very simple. I mean, there's so much -- many opportunities. It's a way to reach a broader customer base, of course. And also, we can capitalize on existing and backbone infrastructure, logistics, sourcing, et cetera. I think, the success so far of the, for example, COS, & Other Stories are very good proofs of that the model, the rationale works.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Adam Cochrane (Analysts)】\nSo as this proportion expands over time, your business model is becoming increasingly complex.

We stick to the fact that there's still lot of potential for us, and we're very happy with the development momentum we have in the U.S. both for our stores and also online.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Porteous (Analysts)】\nCould you just -- coming back to more short-term trading, could you just comment whether there's been any sort of spillover from weather impacts in August into September or whether there any specific drags on short-term trading that you're seeing?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nIt's always very difficult to tell.

And as we book the stock-in-trade at cost, it will affect the stock. And there, of course, our normal expansion in the increase and then the change in the handling of other supply invoices. But when we are looking at the stock level and the composition, we consider it as good. But just actually looking at that, we are not so afraid of the markdowns. But it's far too early to say about the markdowns in Q4, because we still have over 2 months to go.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Geoff Ruddell (Analysts)】\nSo you don't have any significant excess of summer stock leftover?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nNo.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nActually, as we indicated, we have more [indiscernible] garments in the stock that we have compared to the same time last year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Tushar Jain (Analysts)】\nTwo big questions on my side. Just on the first one. Can you tell us what will be the full year currency benefit on the revenues at the current FX schedule? You're currently running at 10% for the first 9 months. Just wondering if you could give us any view on that one?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nYou mean the translation effect?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Tushar Jain (Analysts)】\nTranslation effect, yes. That's good.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nI'm sorry, we don't have any of such guidance. No, we don't, sorry.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Tushar Jain (Analysts)】\nOkay, great. And the second question. Just want to understand. On Sweden, you closed 5 stores in the third quarter, it's just a timing issue as you're relocating the stores or the number has primarily come down from 177 to 172?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nYes, I mean, we always, when we look at the stores, we relocate and sometimes we close them when we come to the end of the contract. So that's quite normal. And as an investor, you shouldn't be worried because we normally typically don't close down profitable and successful stores.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chris Chaviaras (Analysts)】\nYes. Sorry, one very quick one. In the -- can you give us the amount of stores that you have in the 22nd of September?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nNo. We don't have that number in front of us, but we will give you the number by the end of September when we give you the full month sales numbers on the 15th of October, right?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Assad Malic (Analysts)】\nSorry, my question has just been asked by Chris, which you're not answering. Thank you.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nOkay. Thank you all very much for participating in this conference call. And welcome back for the full year result on the 28th of January next year. Bye.",

Joining me on this call from Sasol, as you heard, is our CFO, Bongani Nqwababa. We also have with us other members of our group executive committee in both Johannesburg and Houston who will support us in responding to any questions you may have. As you would have seen after yesterday's media presentation, we announced another resilient group-wide performance, notwithstanding the steep decline in crude oil prices for the period under review. \r\nOur 2015 financial results are a testament to the ongoing commitment of our people and the decisions we took to strategically reposition Sasol for the future and the agility with which we respond to a fundamentally different energy landscape. \r\nTurning to Slide 4 and the key messages you'll hear today. I'll begin by reminding you of how the decisions we have taken as a management team are providing Sasol with a solid platform during these challenging times in our industry. Next, we'll provide you with an update on two of our most important initiatives, our Business Performance Enhancement Programme, which continues to deliver a meaningful company-wide contribution, and our Response Plan, which was launched to respond to the lower-for-longer oil price reality. We'll then go into more detail on our strong operational financial performance in FY '15 with Bongani providing a complete overview of our full year results. Before wrapping up, I'll take you through certain refinements to our strategic agenda including the advancements we've been making on our dual regional strategy and the momentum we are maintaining on selective growth projects in Southern Africa and the U.S. And to conclude the call, we'll recap how Sasol is protecting shareholder value by proactively prioritizing our business activities. \r\nTurning to Slide 5. As you know, due to the cyclical nature of the global energy industry, we build commodity price swings into our short- and long-term assumptions and scenario plans, and while we could not have predicted the exact moment the oil price would drop nor the quantum, we understood that at some point it would. And you could see from the graph, up until 2014, the Brent oil price was stable, between $95 and $125 per barrel, and the Sasol share price gained traction reaching a ZAR 500 to ZAR 600 range. Certainly up until September of last year, group-wide, we were sitting in a reasonably comfortable position. However, at the time, we reiterated that we could not allow our achievements to lull us into a false sense of security. \r\nTo assure organizational stability and resilience during both the good and bad times back in November 2011, and as highlighted by the first colored blocks on the slide, we launched an internal change program driven by the group executive committee. In terms of this top-down program, we refined our corporate strategy and priorities, streamlined our management structures and adapted our values and culture. And having done significant ground work internally, in November 2012, we commissioned an independent diagnostic study to better understand and respond to the root causes of the mounting cost creep, primarily here in South Africa. And we were determined to arrest the concerning trend where our group cash fixed costs from 2007 to 2012 were increasing at a compound rate of 11% annually. \r\nMoving to the second colored block from the graph, we then formally launched our Business Performance Enhancement Programme in 2013, which focused on simplicity, efficiency and cost optimization across the group. Our diagnostics revealed that our cost and complexity challenges primarily related to how we organize ourselves along the siloed, somewhat bureaucratic product-based operating model. Although our Sasol operating platform had evolved over a decade, we had never undergone a clean slate design review and thus never really changed. A crucial milestone of our Business Performance Enhancement Programme was the implementation of our completely revamped operating model on July 1, 2014. That's the third colored block on the slide. In restructuring, rightsizing and repositioning the company, not only were we reducing our cost base and simplifying our systems and processes, we significantly improved our ability to proactively respond to an ever-changing environment. At the time, of course, as we all know, Sasol was in a great position having closed off FY '14 with another set of outstanding results. And as you see here, our share price was at all-time highs. So as you've heard before, we were definitely fixing the roof while the sun was shining. \r\nHowever, with a sudden change in market forces, the energy landscape was shaken up. Coupled with strong oil production from the U.S. and Russia, the determining factor in November 2014 was OPEC's decision to protect market share by maintaining and actually surpassing their output quota levels. Given the significance of the OPEC decision on the global energy sector, and only days later in early December, the Sasol management team started formulating a compressive plan to conserve cash in response to the anticipated lower-for-longer oil price environment. As you may recall, our Response Plan caters for a cash conservation target range of ZAR 30 billion to ZAR 50 billion over a 30-month period from January 2015 to end June 2017. And despite lower international oil prices, and thanks largely to these decisive actions, our share price is weathering this extremely volatile period reasonably well. \r\nNow to Slide 6 and looking at the management interventions in greater detail and our key achievements in FY '15. Under the Business Performance Enhancement Programme, our new operating model has been in place for 15 months now and it is definitely delivering results. We have completed the company-wide organizational redesign with the last of the streamlined structure changes and simplified reporting lines to be implemented by October 2015. Nearly 2,500 voluntary separations and early retirements were approved with overall headcount reducing from 33,400 to 30,919, that's a net reduction of 7.4%. And again, this is net. This is net of adding 300 employees to our headcount to support our ongoing growth initiatives. \r\nIn addition, and importantly, on a monthly basis in FY '15, we've reduced the number of service providers by approximately 10,400 globally when compared with our FY '14 contractor allocations. Let me just spend a minute on this and give you a little more color and context around the service provider numbers. The best place I know to look at for man hours and headcount both for Sasol employees, hired labor employees and service providers, is looking at our safety numbers, which gives us our exposure hours worked around the world, so it tells us exactly how many folks are coming through our gates every day. And so I'd look at the safety hours from FY '13, at the start of Phoenix through the end of this financial year, FY '15, and it's -- we talk about the operating model continuing to deliver results, and certainly, we've had it on the service provider front in our external spend to supply chain. The man hours, exposure man hours for service providers in FY '13 was 133.4 million man hours. And in the end of FY '15, exposure hours for the financial year '15 was down to 96.2 million man hours. So we've had a reduction over the Phoenix period of 16,045 service providers, less people that are coming through the gates basically. And by the way, Sasol employee hours, including hired labor personnel, moved from 95.8 million hours in FY '13 to 82.1 million hours over that same period, so a reduction of 5,905 employees coming out of the system. \r\nNow to ensure that our systems align with our simplified structures, in July this year, we implemented an improved enterprise resource planning system for SA Chemical's supply chain and payroll plus global talent management and health and safety. This SAP system was completely integrated into the company with no business continuity interruptions and was backed up by robust contingency plans. \r\nOver the period, the implementation cost of our Business Performance Enhancement Programme amounted to ZAR 1.9 billion, that's ZAR 200 million lower than planned. Even more notable, this past financial year, we achieved sustainable savings of ZAR 2.5 billion, ZAR 1 billion ahead of our planned savings. Importantly, we continue to target annual cost savings of ZAR 4 billion by the end of this financial year with an exit run rate of at least ZAR 4.3 billion. \r\nTurning to our Response Plan on Slide 7. As mentioned previously, this initiative caters for a cash conservation target range of ZAR 30 billion to ZAR 50 billion over a 30-month period, and builds on the rigorous work conducted as part of the Business Performance Enhancement Programme. As you all know, several core levers underpin our Response Plan. These levers are additional cash cost savings, margin and working capital improvement, capital structuring and capital portfolio optimization. Impressively, from January to June of this year, these areas delivered a cash conservation benefit of ZAR 8.9 billion. This benefits are being realized through further organizational structural refinements in certain functional areas and within our upstream business. \r\nWe also implemented a salary freeze at top, senior and middle management levels throughout the organization. \r\nIn addition, we are banking cost savings from reduced study and exploration costs, trimmed down consulting fees and a freezing of at least 1,000 noncritical vacancies at senior and middle management levels. \r\nSeparately, the Response Plan team has made significant progress in reducing our inventory levels. \r\nMoving on. In January 2015, we announced that we were rightsizing our capital portfolio given the tough external environment. As a result of this exercise, we decided to delay the final investment decision on our gas-to-liquids facility in the U.S., conserving over $600 million in front-end design spend. \r\nAnd as previously communicated in February, the Sasol Limited board confirmed a change in our dividend policy, which is now based on a headline earnings cover range. \r\nAnd you can see from the list of this slide, we have consciously introduced flexible levers into our Response Plan so that we can respond to the volatile macroeconomic environment while ensuring our ultimate profitability over the long term. Cash conservation levers we have formulated are over and above the Business Performance Enhancement Programme savings targets. And while our Response Plan protects cash over a relatively short period of 2.5 years, several initiatives we are actioning will also result in longer-term cost savings.  Here, based on our current analysis, we are looking at an additional ZAR 1 billion in annual sustainable savings from FY '18. \r\nTurning to Slide 8 and our operational performance. Our group safety recordable case rate excluding illnesses improved to 0.32, down appreciably from 0.36 at the end of the last financial year. And anchored by solid contributions across the value chain, liquid fuel sales in our Energy business in Southern Africa were up 5%. Performance Chemicals and normalized Base Chemicals sales volumes were up 2%. \r\nThrough determined management action, our normalized cash fixed costs have continued to trend below inflation and remained flat in nominal terms. \r\nGiven increased sales volumes, resilient margins and cost increases contained to below inflation, profit from operations increased by 2% to ZAR 46.5 billion. Now though headline earnings were down 17% to ZAR 49.76 per share, this is, we believe, a commendable performance in a year when oil prices dropped by 33%. \r\nAnd finally, taking into account the ongoing volatile macroeconomic environment, capital investment plans, our cash conservation drive and the current strength of our financial position, the company has declared a final dividend of ZAR 11.50  per share, which equates to a total dividend of ZAR 18.50 for FY '15. \r\nNow let me hand over to Bongani who is going to unpack our results in much more detail. Bongani?\n\n---\n\nThank you, David, and good day, ladies and gentlemen. It is my pleasure to present our 2015 year-end results to you today, which have exceeded analyst consensus and were well within the earnings range provided in our recent trading statement. We have delivered another strong operational and cost performance despite the highly volatile and uncertain macroeconomic environment. We will continue to deliver sustainable value to our shareholders, and ultimately, our stakeholders. \r\nTurning on to Slide 10. During the period under review, global economic growth continued at a moderate and uneven pace with oil markets in oversupply resulting in significantly lower oil prices. The expected increase in the U.S. interest rate, coupled with uncertainty over the South African growth rate, placed the rand-dollar exchange rates under continued pressure. The average rand-U.S. dollar exchange rate was 10% weaker with a 33% lower average Brent crude oil price. Chemical prices and margins have, on the other hand, been much more resilient given the period under review. The basket price of chemicals in both our Base and Performance Chemical businesses experienced only a 13% decline in dollar-based sales prices. The Sasol business still remains highly sensitive to significant movements in the rand-U.S. dollar exchange rate and oil prices. \r\nTurning on to Slide 11. Overall, we delivered a strong group-wide operational performance as a result of increased sales volumes and significant cost savings contributions across the value chain. This was coupled with improved margins in our Chemicals businesses. Profit from operations of ZAR 46.5 billion was up 2% and benefited positively from one-off item of ZAR 14.7 billion. This was driven largely by macroeconomic factors, changes to the share price and increasing the useful life of our Secunda and Sasolburg operations to 2050 and 2024, respectively, by securing the feedstock. Headline earnings per share decreased by 17% to ZAR 49.76, still ahead of the overall market consensus. Cash fixed costs remained flat in absolute and normalized term following excellent progress with regards to our cost and cash savings initiatives. \r\nMoving on to Slide 12. Taking you through the items impacting the change in profits from year to year. The weaker rand-U.S. dollar exchange rate increased profitability by 15%. This benefit was overshadowed by the lower oil price, which adversely affected profit by 46%. \r\nProfit from operations increased by 32% only as a result of the following one-off items and period-end adjustments: lower depreciation and rehabilitation charges of ZAR 3.2 billion, which would operationalize our 2015 strategy, a ZAR 6.5 billion lower share-based payment charge following the 29% decrease in our share price over the last year, and lastly, lower remeasurement items of ZAR 800 million compared to ZAR 7.6 billion in the prior period. Higher depreciation charges with respect to new plants as well as inflation on costs adversely affected profit by 4%. This decrease was partially negated by our cost and cash savings initiatives, which I will unpack [ph] later. \r\nWe are pleased to report the 4% increase in normalized sales volumes across the group. The increase in sales volumes over the last 2 years contributed 12% to our profit amounting to ZAR 5.2 billion in retail. \r\nMoving on to Slide 13, our cost performance is testimony to the manner in which we sustainably deliver our cost and cash saving initiatives. Normalized cash fixed costs remained flat year-on-year. Contributions from our Business Performance Enhancement Programme and Response Plan resulted in a 5% reduction in our cash fixed cost base offsetting the South African PPI increase of 5% for financial year 2015. We recorded this cost performance despite a very challenging South African cost environment in respect of labor and electricity costs. Our Business Performance Enhancement Programme delivered cost savings of 4% for the 2015 financial year. Cost savings for our Response Plan contributed significantly to a further 2.9% decrease in our cost base. Although we -- overall, we benefited from a weaker exchange rate, the impact of a weaker rand contributed 0.7% to total cash fixed costs. Labor, maintenance and energy remained the main drivers of our cost base with labor comprising approximately 51% of total cash fixed costs. We are mitigating the impact of the electricity cost increase by increasing self-generation and supplying surplus power to Eskom under power purchase agreement. \r\nMoving on to Slide 14. Focusing on our operating business units. Profit from operations in Mining increased by 77% to ZAR 4.3 billion ending as a result of a stellar cost performance coupled with a 2% increase in labor productivity. The benefits of our Business Performance Enhancement Programme, coupled with further operational flexibility, created by the minor replacement program resulted in normalized unit costs from our operations being maintained to 2% below inflation. \r\nExploration and Production International recorded a loss of operation of ZAR 3.2 billion. Our Mozambican operations recorded an operating profit of ZAR 1.1 billion, mainly as a result of favorable gas prices and a 13% increase in the volumes compared to the prior period. Our assets in Gabon were impaired by ZAR 1.3 billion due to the decline in oil prices and the souring of wells. Our Canadian upstream asset generated a loss from operations of ZAR 2.4 billion mainly due to the lower gas prices, which resulted in a further impairment of this asset. On a positive note, we continued to see lower depreciation and operational costs with our new partner, Progress Energy. Our forecast remains to reduce drilling activity until we see a sustainable increase in gas prices. \r\nSlide 15. Underpinned by solid production, our Energy business delivered a commendable set of results relative to the current macroeconomic environment. Secunda Synfuels increased liquid fuels production by 2% with Natref delivering a 6% increase. The Southern Africa Energy portfolio was positively impacted by a 5% increase in liquid fuels sales volumes and higher refining margins from a base of a strong product differentials. Gross margin in this business decreased by only 19% despite the decrease in oil prices. \r\nOur ORYX GTL activity delivered a solid production performance with an average utilization rate of 90% despite an earlier-than-planned shutdown. This was, however, 7% lower than the previous year. And this volume decrease, coupled with the significant drop in oil prices, resulted in our share of profit from the joint venture decreasing to ZAR 1.9 billion. \r\nSlide 16. Our Chemical businesses continued to display resilience to the lower oil price. The Base Chemicals SBU delivered a pleasing performance through increasing profit from operations to ZAR 10.2 billion. Normalized sales volumes increased by 2%. The business also benefited from the impact of the extension of the useful life of assets in South Africa. The reversal of the ZAR 534 million administrative penalty following the Competition Appeal Court decision to further cite the Tribunal's decision further enhanced profitability. \r\nThe Performance Chemicals SBU recorded another strong performance underpinned by consistent and reliable operational delivery and the weaker rand. Profit from operations increased by 7% to ZAR 12.7 billion plus operating margins expanded to 18%. Adjusting for one-off profit from operations, it was up 13%. Sales volumes increased by 2% due to improved production output on the back of higher demand. \r\nOur U.S. business benefited from low ethane prices and continued to realize healthy margins. The contribution from our U.S. business would amount to ZAR 4.2 billion compared to ZAR 4.1 billion in the financial year '14. \r\nOur European operations reported a 3% improvement in production volumes. \r\nMoving on to Slide 17. I would like to expand on what David touched on earlier in respect of our Business Performance Enhancement Programme. We maintained our savings target to generate sustainable annual savings of at least ZAR 4.3 billion at the end of the 2016 financial year. We have achieved actual year-to-date savings of ZAR 2.5 billion, significantly above our expected target of ZAR 1.5 billion in the 2015 financial year. This represents an annualized run rate of ZAR 2.8 billion. Project implementation cost stood at ZAR 1.9 billion for the period and are expected to taper off in the 2016 financial year. This cost includes employee separation costs. We expect cash fixed costs to follow inflation from the 2017 financial year. \r\nSlide 18. Our Response Plan initiative delivered cash savings of ZAR 8.9 billion in the 6 months since announcement of the plan in January 2015. It is encouraging to see our [indiscernible] of delivering savings that are towards the upper end of the expected range. As part of our Response Plan, we are currently working to deliver further sustainable cash flow savings of ZAR 1 billion annually by the 2018 financial year. The Response Plan will provide sufficient flexibility for the company to manage its balance sheet and it would show its growth program was continuing to return maximum sustainable value for the shareholders through dividend payout. \r\nSlide 19. The board declared a final dividend of ZAR 11.50. The total dividend for financial year 2015 represents a dividend cover of 2.7x compared to 2.8x cover last year. This dividend is above market consensus and is indicative of the confidence management has in the continued operational performance and cash savings delivery. Our cash-generating abilities remained robust despite the challenging macroeconomic environment. Our balance sheet remains ungeared at negative 2.8%, and we expect to moderately gear up our balance sheet over the next 2 years as we execute the Lake Charles chemicals project. \r\nWe have a net cash balance of ZAR 5 billion and headroom of ZAR 62 billion in our committed facilities as of 30th June 2015.  Our liquidity remained strong and we are supported by Sasol entering a new $1.5 billion revolving credit facility in January 2015. This facility will also be used to partly fund the cracker project. \r\nOur credit ratings remained unchanged at 1 notch above the sovereign ratings in South Africa. \r\nSlide #20. Our 2016 CapEx estimate has increased by ZAR 5 billion to ZAR 70 billion and our 2017 forecast to ZAR 65 billion as a result of the impact of the weakening rand. This increase is offset by the subsequent increase in our cash flow resulting in our gearing forecast remaining neutral. I would like to emphasize that this increases only as a result of a translation effect as results impact from our cash flow. \r\nThe safety, reliability and sustainability of our operations remain paramount and no compromise will be made in the critical sustenance capital spend. Strategic projects in North America and Southern Africa continue to remain our key focus area. \r\nSlide #21. Finally, we anticipate ongoing lower-for-longer oil prices and exchange rate volatility. We continue to focus on factors within our control and expect overall strong operational performance to continue for the 2016 financial year with South African liquid fuels sales volumes remaining above 60 million barrels. \r\nWe expect the ORYX GTL average utilization rate to be above 87% above an upcoming statutory shutdown. \r\nChemicals businesses sales volumes to continue to improve with margins in Base Chemicals under pressure, but in Performance Chemicals the expected varied margins with our different product streams. \r\nOur cost and cash savings initiatives to continue to deliver with the Response Plan cash contribution of between ZAR 10 billion and ZAR 16 billion. \r\nSustainable savings as part of our Business Performance Enhancement Programme of ZAR 4 billion for financial year '16 will drive normalized cash fixed costs flow to remain below inflation. \r\nWe expect our gearing to increase to a level of between 15% and 30%. \r\nWe are financially well positioned to manage our growth plans in the current low and volatile oil environment. \r\nOn that note, I will hand back to David.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Bongani. To retain our flexibility, we recently refocused our efforts and refined our strategic agenda for the next 5-year period. I just want to assure you that our strategy remains both relevant and achievable in the current and forecast macroeconomic environment. \r\nNow looking at Slide 23, and then as you can see from the left-hand side of the diagram, our strategic agenda is now aligned with our new operating model, identifying, in no uncertain terms, what each operating entity should be driving up to 2020. In response to a lower oil price environment, we are focusing on enhancing our existing assets and on driving selective growth opportunities to create value. To achieve this, here are some of the noteworthy refinements to consider. \r\nFirst, we are looking at selective gas to liquids opportunities. And in tandem, we are considering, where it makes commercial sense, various technology licensing models. \r\nSecond, although not a change, we are emphasizing the promise that gas-to-power has as an important in Southern Africa. With our electricity challenges, this can only serve to bolster much-needed power supply. \r\nThird, we continue to drive our growth programs, primarily in Southern Africa and the U.S., although our focus has shifted somewhat from energy to chemicals in the near term. \r\nOf course, our Business Performance Enhancement Programme and the Response Plan are both key enablers, allowing us to deliver on our strategic aspirations.  Putting these refinements aside, our strategic agenda reinforces the importance of a diversified portfolio which ensures resilience. \r\nAs we look beyond the end of the decade, we are also currently fine-tuning our longer-term strategy where the future Sasol primarily remains an integrated natural resource monetizer and a technology leader. \r\nMoving on to Slide 24. Over the past year, we continue to strategically position ourselves to advance our gas state growth programs, concentrated largely in Southern Africa and North America. In South Africa, we've embarked on an extensive strategy to ensure the efficiency and reliability of our in-country operations through the middle of the century. As part of this initiative, our ZAR 14.2 billion Secunda growth program is nearing completion, with 16 of the 19 projects achieving beneficial operation. The successful completion of these projects has ensured the full realization of their anticipated volume and electricity benefits. The remaining 3 projects are small utility initiatives, and are expected to reach beneficial operation by the end of the 2015 calendar year. \r\nAt the end of May 2015, we successfully commissioned Phase 1 of our Wax Expansion Project in Sasolburg. This was a significant milestone and marked another step towards expanding our Southern African operations, as well as demonstrating our commitment to South Africa through ongoing industrial investment. Phase 2 of the Wax Project has commenced and is expected to be commissioned during the first half of the 2017 calendar year. \r\nReporting Southern Africa growth, the Mozambican  gas industry is poised to play an increasingly important role in the regional energy landscape. In February 2015, we submitted our full field development plan for the Pande and Temane Production Sharing Agreement for the Mozambican authorities. The PSA FDP proposes an integrated oil, LPG and gas project adjacent to our existing Petroleum Production Agreement area. Should the FDP be approved, we've also submitted a proposal to enable the development of a fifth train at our central processing facility to process additional gas from the PSA license area. \r\nLooking now at Slide 25 in North America specifically, during August 2014, Sasol and our partner, INEOS, successfully concluded a toll manufacturing joint venture known as Gemini HDPE. Construction of a high-density polyethylene facility has commenced in Texas, and plant start-up is planned towards the end of the 2016 calendar year. The complex will produce 470,000 tons of high-value, bimodal HDPE annually. Also in the U.S. is following our final investment decision to proceed with the ethane cracker and derivatives complex in Louisiana. Significant progress has been made in detailed engineering and infrastructure work. Cumulative expenditure to end FY '15 was $1.8 billion, with the total amount contracted equal to $4.9 billion. And at the end of July, $2.2 billion has been expended, and $5.3 billion under total contract. \r\nConstruction activities are proceeding as planned, with site preparation work for major units nearing completion. And note that we are still on track for stage completion of all units during the 2018 calendar year. \r\nAnd my final slide, Slide 26. To protect shareholder value given the global circumstances, we are assuring that our regional operating hubs continue to focus on stable, reliable and safe operations while delivering at record output levels. Our diverse portfolio, supported by the resilience of our chemicals, mining and downstream refining businesses enables us to maintain solid results during the lower oil price environment. Our strategic business units continue to perform, and through our proactive cost optimization and cash conservation initiatives, we are achieving sustainable efficiencies and cost reductions throughout the group. \r\nLooking beyond the here and now, refining our near- to medium-term strategic agenda and by prioritizing selective growth projects, we are able to protect our balance sheet, and in turn, continue to deliver shareholder value. With cash flow generation remaining strong, the management team and I are confident that our refined strategy and focused efforts will assure long-term profitability for Sasol. \r\nWith that, let me now turn it back to the operator who will open it up for any questions that you may have. Operator?",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: David Edward Constable (Executives)】\nThank you, operator, and good day, everyone. Thanks for joining us for Sasol's year-end results conference call. Joining me on this call from Sasol, as you heard, is our CFO, Bongani Nqwababa. We also have with us other members of our group executive committee in both Johannesburg and Houston who will support us in responding to any questions you may have. As you would have seen after yesterday's media presentation, we announced another resilient group-wide performance, notwithstanding the steep decline in crude oil prices for the period under review. \r\nOur 2015 financial results are a testament to the ongoing commitment of our people and the decisions we took to strategically reposition Sasol for the future and the agility with which we respond to a fundamentally different energy landscape. \r\nTurning to Slide 4 and the key messages you'll hear today. I'll begin by reminding you of how the decisions we have taken as a management team are providing Sasol with a solid platform during these challenging times in our industry. Next, we'll provide you with an update on two of our most important initiatives, our Business Performance Enhancement Programme, which continues to deliver a meaningful company-wide contribution, and our Response Plan, which was launched to respond to the lower-for-longer oil price reality. We'll then go into more detail on our strong operational financial performance in FY '15 with Bongani providing a complete overview of our full year results. Before wrapping up, I'll take you through certain refinements to our strategic agenda including the advancements we've been making on our dual regional strategy and the momentum we are maintaining on selective growth projects in Southern Africa and the U.S. And to conclude the call, we'll recap how Sasol is protecting shareholder value by proactively prioritizing our business activities. \r\nTurning to Slide 5. As you know, due to the cyclical nature of the global energy industry, we build commodity price swings into our short- and long-term assumptions and scenario plans, and while we could not have predicted the exact moment the oil price would drop nor the quantum, we understood that at some point it would. And you could see from the graph, up until 2014, the Brent oil price was stable, between $95 and $125 per barrel, and the Sasol share price gained traction reaching a ZAR 500 to ZAR 600 range. Certainly up until September of last year, group-wide, we were sitting in a reasonably comfortable position. However, at the time, we reiterated that we could not allow our achievements to lull us into a false sense of security. \r\nTo assure organizational stability and resilience during both the good and bad times back in November 2011, and as highlighted by the first colored blocks on the slide, we launched an internal change program driven by the group executive committee. In terms of this top-down program, we refined our corporate strategy and priorities, streamlined our management structures and adapted our values and culture. And having done significant ground work internally, in November 2012, we commissioned an independent diagnostic study to better understand and respond to the root causes of the mounting cost creep, primarily here in South Africa. And we were determined to arrest the concerning trend where our group cash fixed costs from 2007 to 2012 were increasing at a compound rate of 11% annually. \r\nMoving to the second colored block from the graph, we then formally launched our Business Performance Enhancement Programme in 2013, which focused on simplicity, efficiency and cost optimization across the group. Our diagnostics revealed that our cost and complexity challenges primarily related to how we organize ourselves along the siloed, somewhat bureaucratic product-based operating model. Although our Sasol operating platform had evolved over a decade, we had never undergone a clean slate design review and thus never really changed. A crucial milestone of our Business Performance Enhancement Programme was the implementation of our completely revamped operating model on July 1, 2014. That's the third colored block on the slide. In restructuring, rightsizing and repositioning the company, not only were we reducing our cost base and simplifying our systems and processes, we significantly improved our ability to proactively respond to an ever-changing environment. At the time, of course, as we all know, Sasol was in a great position having closed off FY '14 with another set of outstanding results. And as you see here, our share price was at all-time highs. So as you've heard before, we were definitely fixing the roof while the sun was shining. \r\nHowever, with a sudden change in market forces, the energy landscape was shaken up. Coupled with strong oil production from the U.S. and Russia, the determining factor in November 2014 was OPEC's decision to protect market share by maintaining and actually surpassing their output quota levels. Given the significance of the OPEC decision on the global energy sector, and only days later in early December, the Sasol management team started formulating a compressive plan to conserve cash in response to the anticipated lower-for-longer oil price environment. As you may recall, our Response Plan caters for a cash conservation target range of ZAR 30 billion to ZAR 50 billion over a 30-month period from January 2015 to end June 2017. And despite lower international oil prices, and thanks largely to these decisive actions, our share price is weathering this extremely volatile period reasonably well. \r\nNow to Slide 6 and looking at the management interventions in greater detail and our key achievements in FY '15. Under the Business Performance Enhancement Programme, our new operating model has been in place for 15 months now and it is definitely delivering results. We have completed the company-wide organizational redesign with the last of the streamlined structure changes and simplified reporting lines to be implemented by October 2015. Nearly 2,500 voluntary separations and early retirements were approved with overall headcount reducing from 33,400 to 30,919, that's a net reduction of 7.4%. And again, this is net. This is net of adding 300 employees to our headcount to support our ongoing growth initiatives. \r\nIn addition, and importantly, on a monthly basis in FY '15, we've reduced the number of service providers by approximately 10,400 globally when compared with our FY '14 contractor allocations. Let me just spend a minute on this and give you a little more color and context around the service provider numbers. The best place I know to look at for man hours and headcount both for Sasol employees, hired labor employees and service providers, is looking at our safety numbers, which gives us our exposure hours worked around the world, so it tells us exactly how many folks are coming through our gates every day. And so I'd look at the safety hours from FY '13, at the start of Phoenix through the end of this financial year, FY '15, and it's -- we talk about the operating model continuing to deliver results, and certainly, we've had it on the service provider front in our external spend to supply chain. The man hours, exposure man hours for service providers in FY '13 was 133.4 million man hours. And in the end of FY '15, exposure hours for the financial year '15 was down to 96.2 million man hours. So we've had a reduction over the Phoenix period of 16,045 service providers, less people that are coming through the gates basically. And by the way, Sasol employee hours, including hired labor personnel, moved from 95.8 million hours in FY '13 to 82.1 million hours over that same period, so a reduction of 5,905 employees coming out of the system. \r\nNow to ensure that our systems align with our simplified structures, in July this year, we implemented an improved enterprise resource planning system for SA Chemical's supply chain and payroll plus global talent management and health and safety. This SAP system was completely integrated into the company with no business continuity interruptions and was backed up by robust contingency plans. \r\nOver the period, the implementation cost of our Business Performance Enhancement Programme amounted to ZAR 1.9 billion, that's ZAR 200 million lower than planned. Even more notable, this past financial year, we achieved sustainable savings of ZAR 2.5 billion, ZAR 1 billion ahead of our planned savings. Importantly, we continue to target annual cost savings of ZAR 4 billion by the end of this financial year with an exit run rate of at least ZAR 4.3 billion. \r\nTurning to our Response Plan on Slide 7. As mentioned previously, this initiative caters for a cash conservation target range of ZAR 30 billion to ZAR 50 billion over a 30-month period, and builds on the rigorous work conducted as part of the Business Performance Enhancement Programme. As you all know, several core levers underpin our Response Plan. These levers are additional cash cost savings, margin and working capital improvement, capital structuring and capital portfolio optimization. Impressively, from January to June of this year, these areas delivered a cash conservation benefit of ZAR 8.9 billion. This benefits are being realized through further organizational structural refinements in certain functional areas and within our upstream business. \r\nWe also implemented a salary freeze at top, senior and middle management levels throughout the organization. \r\nIn addition, we are banking cost savings from reduced study and exploration costs, trimmed down consulting fees and a freezing of at least 1,000 noncritical vacancies at senior and middle management levels. \r\nSeparately, the Response Plan team has made significant progress in reducing our inventory levels. \r\nMoving on. In January 2015, we announced that we were rightsizing our capital portfolio given the tough external environment. As a result of this exercise, we decided to delay the final investment decision on our gas-to-liquids facility in the U.S., conserving over $600 million in front-end design spend. \r\nAnd as previously communicated in February, the Sasol Limited board confirmed a change in our dividend policy, which is now based on a headline earnings cover range. \r\nAnd you can see from the list of this slide, we have consciously introduced flexible levers into our Response Plan so that we can respond to the volatile macroeconomic environment while ensuring our ultimate profitability over the long term. Cash conservation levers we have formulated are over and above the Business Performance Enhancement Programme savings targets. And while our Response Plan protects cash over a relatively short period of 2.5 years, several initiatives we are actioning will also result in longer-term cost savings.  Here, based on our current analysis, we are looking at an additional ZAR 1 billion in annual sustainable savings from FY '18. \r\nTurning to Slide 8 and our operational performance. Our group safety recordable case rate excluding illnesses improved to 0.32, down appreciably from 0.36 at the end of the last financial year. And anchored by solid contributions across the value chain, liquid fuel sales in our Energy business in Southern Africa were up 5%. Performance Chemicals and normalized Base Chemicals sales volumes were up 2%. \r\nThrough determined management action, our normalized cash fixed costs have continued to trend below inflation and remained flat in nominal terms. \r\nGiven increased sales volumes, resilient margins and cost increases contained to below inflation, profit from operations increased by 2% to ZAR 46.5 billion. Now though headline earnings were down 17% to ZAR 49.76 per share, this is, we believe, a commendable performance in a year when oil prices dropped by 33%. \r\nAnd finally, taking into account the ongoing volatile macroeconomic environment, capital investment plans, our cash conservation drive and the current strength of our financial position, the company has declared a final dividend of ZAR 11.50  per share, which equates to a total dividend of ZAR 18.50 for FY '15. \r\nNow let me hand over to Bongani who is going to unpack our results in much more detail. Bongani?\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Bongani Nqwababa (Executives)】\nThank you, David, and good day, ladies and gentlemen. It is my pleasure to present our 2015 year-end results to you today, which have exceeded analyst consensus and were well within the earnings range provided in our recent trading statement. We have delivered another strong operational and cost performance despite the highly volatile and uncertain macroeconomic environment. We will continue to deliver sustainable value to our shareholders, and ultimately, our stakeholders. \r\nTurning on to Slide 10. During the period under review, global economic growth continued at a moderate and uneven pace with oil markets in oversupply resulting in significantly lower oil prices. The expected increase in the U.S. interest rate, coupled with uncertainty over the South African growth rate, placed the rand-dollar exchange rates under continued pressure. The average rand-U.S. dollar exchange rate was 10% weaker with a 33% lower average Brent crude oil price. Chemical prices and margins have, on the other hand, been much more resilient given the period under review. The basket price of chemicals in both our Base and Performance Chemical businesses experienced only a 13% decline in dollar-based sales prices. The Sasol business still remains highly sensitive to significant movements in the rand-U.S. dollar exchange rate and oil prices. \r\nTurning on to Slide 11. Overall, we delivered a strong group-wide operational performance as a result of increased sales volumes and significant cost savings contributions across the value chain. This was coupled with improved margins in our Chemicals businesses. Profit from operations of ZAR 46.5 billion was up 2% and benefited positively from one-off item of ZAR 14.7 billion. This was driven largely by macroeconomic factors, changes to the share price and increasing the useful life of our Secunda and Sasolburg operations to 2050 and 2024, respectively, by securing the feedstock. Headline earnings per share decreased by 17% to ZAR 49.76, still ahead of the overall market consensus. Cash fixed costs remained flat in absolute and normalized term following excellent progress with regards to our cost and cash savings initiatives. \r\nMoving on to Slide 12. Taking you through the items impacting the change in profits from year to year. The weaker rand-U.S. dollar exchange rate increased profitability by 15%. This benefit was overshadowed by the lower oil price, which adversely affected profit by 46%. \r\nProfit from operations increased by 32% only as a result of the following one-off items and period-end adjustments: lower depreciation and rehabilitation charges of ZAR 3.2 billion, which would operationalize our 2015 strategy, a ZAR 6.5 billion lower share-based payment charge following the 29% decrease in our share price over the last year, and lastly, lower remeasurement items of ZAR 800 million compared to ZAR 7.6 billion in the prior period. Higher depreciation charges with respect to new plants as well as inflation on costs adversely affected profit by 4%. This decrease was partially negated by our cost and cash savings initiatives, which I will unpack [ph] later. \r\nWe are pleased to report the 4% increase in normalized sales volumes across the group. The increase in sales volumes over the last 2 years contributed 12% to our profit amounting to ZAR 5.2 billion in retail. \r\nMoving on to Slide 13, our cost performance is testimony to the manner in which we sustainably deliver our cost and cash saving initiatives. Normalized cash fixed costs remained flat year-on-year. Contributions from our Business Performance Enhancement Programme and Response Plan resulted in a 5% reduction in our cash fixed cost base offsetting the South African PPI increase of 5% for financial year 2015. We recorded this cost performance despite a very challenging South African cost environment in respect of labor and electricity costs. Our Business Performance Enhancement Programme delivered cost savings of 4% for the 2015 financial year. Cost savings for our Response Plan contributed significantly to a further 2.9% decrease in our cost base. Although we -- overall, we benefited from a weaker exchange rate, the impact of a weaker rand contributed 0.7% to total cash fixed costs. Labor, maintenance and energy remained the main drivers of our cost base with labor comprising approximately 51% of total cash fixed costs. We are mitigating the impact of the electricity cost increase by increasing self-generation and supplying surplus power to Eskom under power purchase agreement. \r\nMoving on to Slide 14. Focusing on our operating business units. Profit from operations in Mining increased by 77% to ZAR 4.3 billion ending as a result of a stellar cost performance coupled with a 2% increase in labor productivity. The benefits of our Business Performance Enhancement Programme, coupled with further operational flexibility, created by the minor replacement program resulted in normalized unit costs from our operations being maintained to 2% below inflation. \r\nExploration and Production International recorded a loss of operation of ZAR 3.2 billion. Our Mozambican operations recorded an operating profit of ZAR 1.1 billion, mainly as a result of favorable gas prices and a 13% increase in the volumes compared to the prior period. Our assets in Gabon were impaired by ZAR 1.3 billion due to the decline in oil prices and the souring of wells. Our Canadian upstream asset generated a loss from operations of ZAR 2.4 billion mainly due to the lower gas prices, which resulted in a further impairment of this asset. On a positive note, we continued to see lower depreciation and operational costs with our new partner, Progress Energy. Our forecast remains to reduce drilling activity until we see a sustainable increase in gas prices. \r\nSlide 15. Underpinned by solid production, our Energy business delivered a commendable set of results relative to the current macroeconomic environment. Secunda Synfuels increased liquid fuels production by 2% with Natref delivering a 6% increase. The Southern Africa Energy portfolio was positively impacted by a 5% increase in liquid fuels sales volumes and higher refining margins from a base of a strong product differentials. Gross margin in this business decreased by only 19% despite the decrease in oil prices. \r\nOur ORYX GTL activity delivered a solid production performance with an average utilization rate of 90% despite an earlier-than-planned shutdown. This was, however, 7% lower than the previous year. And this volume decrease, coupled with the significant drop in oil prices, resulted in our share of profit from the joint venture decreasing to ZAR 1.9 billion. \r\nSlide 16. Our Chemical businesses continued to display resilience to the lower oil price. The Base Chemicals SBU delivered a pleasing performance through increasing profit from operations to ZAR 10.2 billion. Normalized sales volumes increased by 2%. The business also benefited from the impact of the extension of the useful life of assets in South Africa. The reversal of the ZAR 534 million administrative penalty following the Competition Appeal Court decision to further cite the Tribunal's decision further enhanced profitability. \r\nThe Performance Chemicals SBU recorded another strong performance underpinned by consistent and reliable operational delivery and the weaker rand. Profit from operations increased by 7% to ZAR 12.7 billion plus operating margins expanded to 18%. Adjusting for one-off profit from operations, it was up 13%. Sales volumes increased by 2% due to improved production output on the back of higher demand. \r\nOur U.S. business benefited from low ethane prices and continued to realize healthy margins. The contribution from our U.S. business would amount to ZAR 4.2 billion compared to ZAR 4.1 billion in the financial year '14. \r\nOur European operations reported a 3% improvement in production volumes. \r\nMoving on to Slide 17. I would like to expand on what David touched on earlier in respect of our Business Performance Enhancement Programme. We maintained our savings target to generate sustainable annual savings of at least ZAR 4.3 billion at the end of the 2016 financial year. We have achieved actual year-to-date savings of ZAR 2.5 billion, significantly above our expected target of ZAR 1.5 billion in the 2015 financial year. This represents an annualized run rate of ZAR 2.8 billion. Project implementation cost stood at ZAR 1.9 billion for the period and are expected to taper off in the 2016 financial year. This cost includes employee separation costs. We expect cash fixed costs to follow inflation from the 2017 financial year. \r\nSlide 18. Our Response Plan initiative delivered cash savings of ZAR 8.9 billion in the 6 months since announcement of the plan in January 2015. It is encouraging to see our [indiscernible] of delivering savings that are towards the upper end of the expected range. As part of our Response Plan, we are currently working to deliver further sustainable cash flow savings of ZAR 1 billion annually by the 2018 financial year. The Response Plan will provide sufficient flexibility for the company to manage its balance sheet and it would show its growth program was continuing to return maximum sustainable value for the shareholders through dividend payout. \r\nSlide 19. The board declared a final dividend of ZAR 11.50. The total dividend for financial year 2015 represents a dividend cover of 2.7x compared to 2.8x cover last year. This dividend is above market consensus and is indicative of the confidence management has in the continued operational performance and cash savings delivery. Our cash-generating abilities remained robust despite the challenging macroeconomic environment. Our balance sheet remains ungeared at negative 2.8%, and we expect to moderately gear up our balance sheet over the next 2 years as we execute the Lake Charles chemicals project. \r\nWe have a net cash balance of ZAR 5 billion and headroom of ZAR 62 billion in our committed facilities as of 30th June 2015.  Our liquidity remained strong and we are supported by Sasol entering a new $1.5 billion revolving credit facility in January 2015. This facility will also be used to partly fund the cracker project. \r\nOur credit ratings remained unchanged at 1 notch above the sovereign ratings in South Africa. \r\nSlide #20. Our 2016 CapEx estimate has increased by ZAR 5 billion to ZAR 70 billion and our 2017 forecast to ZAR 65 billion as a result of the impact of the weakening rand. This increase is offset by the subsequent increase in our cash flow resulting in our gearing forecast remaining neutral. I would like to emphasize that this increases only as a result of a translation effect as results impact from our cash flow. \r\nThe safety, reliability and sustainability of our operations remain paramount and no compromise will be made in the critical sustenance capital spend. Strategic projects in North America and Southern Africa continue to remain our key focus area. \r\nSlide #21. Finally, we anticipate ongoing lower-for-longer oil prices and exchange rate volatility. We continue to focus on factors within our control and expect overall strong operational performance to continue for the 2016 financial year with South African liquid fuels sales volumes remaining above 60 million barrels. \r\nWe expect the ORYX GTL average utilization rate to be above 87% above an upcoming statutory shutdown. \r\nChemicals businesses sales volumes to continue to improve with margins in Base Chemicals under pressure, but in Performance Chemicals the expected varied margins with our different product streams. \r\nOur cost and cash savings initiatives to continue to deliver with the Response Plan cash contribution of between ZAR 10 billion and ZAR 16 billion. \r\nSustainable savings as part of our Business Performance Enhancement Programme of ZAR 4 billion for financial year '16 will drive normalized cash fixed costs flow to remain below inflation. \r\nWe expect our gearing to increase to a level of between 15% and 30%. \r\nWe are financially well positioned to manage our growth plans in the current low and volatile oil environment. \r\nOn that note, I will hand back to David.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: David Edward Constable (Executives)】\nThank you, Bongani. To retain our flexibility, we recently refocused our efforts and refined our strategic agenda for the next 5-year period. I just want to assure you that our strategy remains both relevant and achievable in the current and forecast macroeconomic environment. \r\nNow looking at Slide 23, and then as you can see from the left-hand side of the diagram, our strategic agenda is now aligned with our new operating model, identifying, in no uncertain terms, what each operating entity should be driving up to 2020. In response to a lower oil price environment, we are focusing on enhancing our existing assets and on driving selective growth opportunities to create value. To achieve this, here are some of the noteworthy refinements to consider. \r\nFirst, we are looking at selective gas to liquids opportunities. And in tandem, we are considering, where it makes commercial sense, various technology licensing models. \r\nSecond, although not a change, we are emphasizing the promise that gas-to-power has as an important in Southern Africa. With our electricity challenges, this can only serve to bolster much-needed power supply. \r\nThird, we continue to drive our growth programs, primarily in Southern Africa and the U.S., although our focus has shifted somewhat from energy to chemicals in the near term. \r\nOf course, our Business Performance Enhancement Programme and the Response Plan are both key enablers, allowing us to deliver on our strategic aspirations.  Putting these refinements aside, our strategic agenda reinforces the importance of a diversified portfolio which ensures resilience. \r\nAs we look beyond the end of the decade, we are also currently fine-tuning our longer-term strategy where the future Sasol primarily remains an integrated natural resource monetizer and a technology leader. \r\nMoving on to Slide 24. Over the past year, we continue to strategically position ourselves to advance our gas state growth programs, concentrated largely in Southern Africa and North America. In South Africa, we've embarked on an extensive strategy to ensure the efficiency and reliability of our in-country operations through the middle of the century. As part of this initiative, our ZAR 14.2 billion Secunda growth program is nearing completion, with 16 of the 19 projects achieving beneficial operation. The successful completion of these projects has ensured the full realization of their anticipated volume and electricity benefits. The remaining 3 projects are small utility initiatives, and are expected to reach beneficial operation by the end of the 2015 calendar year. \r\nAt the end of May 2015, we successfully commissioned Phase 1 of our Wax Expansion Project in Sasolburg. This was a significant milestone and marked another step towards expanding our Southern African operations, as well as demonstrating our commitment to South Africa through ongoing industrial investment. Phase 2 of the Wax Project has commenced and is expected to be commissioned during the first half of the 2017 calendar year. \r\nReporting Southern Africa growth, the Mozambican  gas industry is poised to play an increasingly important role in the regional energy landscape. In February 2015, we submitted our full field development plan for the Pande and Temane Production Sharing Agreement for the Mozambican authorities. The PSA FDP proposes an integrated oil, LPG and gas project adjacent to our existing Petroleum Production Agreement area. Should the FDP be approved, we've also submitted a proposal to enable the development of a fifth train at our central processing facility to process additional gas from the PSA license area. \r\nLooking now at Slide 25 in North America specifically, during August 2014, Sasol and our partner, INEOS, successfully concluded a toll manufacturing joint venture known as Gemini HDPE. Construction of a high-density polyethylene facility has commenced in Texas, and plant start-up is planned towards the end of the 2016 calendar year. The complex will produce 470,000 tons of high-value, bimodal HDPE annually. Also in the U.S. is following our final investment decision to proceed with the ethane cracker and derivatives complex in Louisiana. Significant progress has been made in detailed engineering and infrastructure work. Cumulative expenditure to end FY '15 was $1.8 billion, with the total amount contracted equal to $4.9 billion. And at the end of July, $2.2 billion has been expended, and $5.3 billion under total contract. \r\nConstruction activities are proceeding as planned, with site preparation work for major units nearing completion. And note that we are still on track for stage completion of all units during the 2018 calendar year. \r\nAnd my final slide, Slide 26. To protect shareholder value given the global circumstances, we are assuring that our regional operating hubs continue to focus on stable, reliable and safe operations while delivering at record output levels. Our diverse portfolio, supported by the resilience of our chemicals, mining and downstream refining businesses enables us to maintain solid results during the lower oil price environment. Our strategic business units continue to perform, and through our proactive cost optimization and cash conservation initiatives, we are achieving sustainable efficiencies and cost reductions throughout the group. \r\nLooking beyond the here and now, refining our near- to medium-term strategic agenda and by prioritizing selective growth projects, we are able to protect our balance sheet, and in turn, continue to deliver shareholder value. With cash flow generation remaining strong, the management team and I are confident that our refined strategy and focused efforts will assure long-term profitability for Sasol. \r\nWith that, let me now turn it back to the operator who will open it up for any questions that you may have. Operator?",
      "transcript_text3": "Just in terms of some of the cost savings, which I suppose we can still extract further. I mean, while I'm quite interested in the mining costs, which we're very well-contained, I was wondering if you can give us a bit more color as you move into the newer mines. How much more potential savings there could be just given the fact that they will be newer and closer to -- well, I suppose closer to operations to some extent? And then also just another question quickly on gearing. I know you've given us some nice guidance between 15% and 30% for next year, can you potentially just give us some kind of color on what your FX assumptions are in that kind of a range to support that? And where you'd see that peaking given the peak part of the CapEx for the U.S.?\n\n---\n\nThanks, Jarrett. It's appreciated. Mining costs, I'll turn it to Paul here and Bongani. You want to take on mining costs. We've got new mines coming on, much more productive from the level later this year. And, Bongani, next year, just give us a little color on where we think mining costs are going.\n\n---\n\nBongani here, if I might respond to that. Our anticipation is actually in spite of the delay by  increases, we see the costing slightly below South African inflation.\n\n---\n\nThank you. Gearing, guidance is 15% to 30%, Jarrett, like you said in FY '16. We see a peak gearing rates, 38% to 39%, is what we're looking at right now. And on FX, can we give some color on the assumptions? Around of -- between 12 50 and 13 50 is what we're looking at, in the assumptions on that.\n\n---\n\nJust 3 questions please. Just in terms of the sort  of expected CapEx for the cracker, I know it's all fairly early days, but do you still see any sort of opportunity to bring that down? And then just secondly, with the spread obviously sort of hovering at 50 below, 50 at the moment, when does the sort of dividend cover that was revised this year become a problem for you guys, or when do you think it will at least? And then just lastly, in terms of the volumes out of Synfuels, I mean, it's really good solid production there. I think it was at 32.9. I mean, how much sort of upside do you guys sort of foresee? Or was that the sort of new sustainable number?\n\n---\n\nOkay, let me just see if got these right. The first one, it was on cracker capital cost and if there's any, if you will, upside on that.\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nThe next question was on Synfuels production, was there any upside there going forward. And could you just -- did someone get the second question? It was garbled.\n\n---\n\nYes. Sorry, David...\n\n---\n\nThank you. Breakeven levels at -- in operations. So we do have Steve Cornell on the line from Houston. CapEx, approximately now on the crackers, still tracking to 8.9 billion. Still at a good level of contingency being held by ourselves. And so we've had good results with, obviously, the downturn in the industry, the oil and gas industry, and the lower oil price. We've been able to go back and negotiate, if you will, with our contractors on fees and on some of the contracting rates as well. So that has helped us. But right now we're still tracking at 8.9 billion. I think, like you said, it's a little early to start trending away from that number. But as I said in the prepared notes, making good progress on the project. And with a focus on utilities and offsites right now, getting engineering and procurement on the utilities and offsites to get up to speed with our process units, which are all on track basically, progress-wise. So Steve, do you have anything to add, or is that sufficient?\n\n---\n\nI think that's sufficient. We've made good progress where we can, had some opportunities. You always have some unexpected increases on the other side, we're very comfortable with the 8.9 billion, and look like we're going to continue to track on that level.\n\n---\n\nThank you. Breakeven cost, I'd be guessing. I think I know there. But can we go ahead? Go ahead, Bongani.\n\n---\n\nThe breakeven cost is [indiscernible] just below the USD 40 a barrel.\n\n---\n\nAnd then on Synfuels, we had a great year, right? 32.9 million barrels, and that equates to, in the old way of talking about it, about 7.7 million tons. And for FY '15, 3.9 million tons of liquid fuels and 3.8 million tons of chemicals. As you heard, we're talking about 6 -- over 60 million barrels from a liquid fuel sales volumes perspective. And guiding at Synfuels right now, about 31.7 million barrels. So down slightly from this financial year, but possibly some upside to that. But those are the numbers as we see them right now.\n\n---\n\nA couple of questions here. I noticed from your remuneration report that there were some specific targets for Phoenix for 2015. I just wondered if you could let us know what the threshold and the stretch targets are for cost savings for 2016? First question. Also just on chemical prices, they've been pretty firm in the second quarter and are starting to come off now. I just wondered what your expectations are for chemical prices, particularly surfactants, in the next couple of months? And also, what your exposure is to contract and spot ethylene prices in the U.S.? And then maybe if you could give a little bit more information on the costs and timing of your Mozambique explorations?\n\n---\n\nThanks, Alex. Remuneration, I think, we've got that for the threshold and stretch for FY '16. Go ahead, Paul. Paul Victor is joining us.\n\n---\n\nYes, so basically, from a stretch target perspective, what we have done for our cost targets was to incorporate our Project Phoenix, as well as our Response Plan savings. On Phoenix, we mentioned before, if -- we plan to achieve ZAR 4 billion of cash -- of cost savings in financial year '16, and then we provided guidance between 4 and 7 on the cost of savings from the Response Plan. And all of this has been brought into our targets. If we achieve effectively the Response Plan and our Project Phoenix cost objectives, then you can see that become 100% target. Yet, we outperformed that, for the stretch target and it's in a very narrow band [indiscernible] effectively, we will go to kind of the 0 scoring range. So it's a very narrow on the downside, but a long stretch on the upside, but effectively, 100% for all your Response Plan and Phoenix targets being met.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Paul. Now, on chemical prices, as you heard, in FY '16, base chemical margins will come under some amount of pressure. And on Performance Chemicals -- on the Performance Chemicals side, those margins will be varied depending on which product we're talking about. So maybe I could ask Fleetwood to give a little more color around surfactants and ethylene prices that Alex was looking for? Fleetwood?\n\n---\n\nThank you. Alex, yes, the view on surfactants pricing going forward is that we had a very stable year, and as a matter of fact, we've been able to grow some volumes -- sales volumes in that specific area. Our expectation that it's going to remain robust in this coming year. Looking then into the question regarding spot ethylene price, yes, it has come under pressure lately. You also need to take in consideration that we are taking that benefit also downstream into the derivatives so that margin flows through in our downstream products in indexings, but we believe that will also recover. And as we start to minimize our exposure to the spot ethylene price, remember that by the end of next year,  with Gemini, we will consume most of our spot ethylene that we currently sell into the market, so that would mitigate that exposure, as well as we ramp up our [indiscernible] project, we may find ourselves, towards the end of next year, early year thereafter, that we would be almost a net buyer of ethylene before the big [indiscernible] cracker starts up. So I think yes, it will soften, but I think we still have a solid outlook to most of the other product groupings. The part that is really under pressure, we know that, is the base chemicals, which is mostly affected by the lower oil price, naphtha playing to the ethylene derivatives and propylene derivatives, and we also foresee some interesting new capacity coming into play as of next year in the Middle East, and that would also put further pressure on our polymer prices. So that's more or less the view.\n\n---\n\nOh, yes. I'm sorry. Operator, let me just talk to Mozambique for one second. I'll turn my page there. Timing and costs for Mozambique. The PSA developments, the field development plan for tranche 1 of the PSA development, as I said, was submitted in February. We're awaiting field development plan approval, we think, in the October timeframe, certainly before the end of the year, and possibly as early as October. The ultimate program is just over USD 2 billion that we'll be investing in tranche 1 of the PSA development. The gas -- the ultimate reserves, obviously, is going to punch some wells before we can make the call on the ultimate reserves there. But the first part of call is to produce 400 megawatts of power in Mozambique, and we're looking at a study to take that gas into power generation in Mozambique. That would be the first project that will be assigned to that gas as it becomes available. And we've also obviously got the oil reservoirs and LPG, which is very interesting for us as well. So timing-wise, Leon, do you have timing as far as start up?\n\n---\n\nCompleted depending -- it's Giullean [ph]. Depending on the FDP, field development plan approval, the expected completion is by 2019.\n\n---\n\nYes, thank you. Okay. Operator, now, we can proceed.\n\n---\n\nI have questions as well. David, you said at the outset, the oil price to fall at some [indiscernible]...\n\n---\n\nSorry, can you say that...\n\n---\n\nOkay. Can you hear me now?\n\n---\n\nThat's better. Thank you.\n\n---\n\nOkay. At the outset of the presentation, you expected the oil price would drop. What is the time to on hit the price? And what's the bottom, the contango that is using both view on selling oil at this point. That's my first question. Just looking at the volumes. Have you [indiscernible] efforts from EPU5 and pre-stabilization yet? Do you expect the full benefits to come through? And then lastly, what is the endgame for you? You keep on spending more gases being produced in the eastern move -- in the moving west in North America. Quite clear what the Canadian shale will be in the [indiscernible] use the endgame?\n\n---\n\n[indiscernible] tough. I think you asked about oil prices, to start with and where they're going. Can you -- can you just at least try that one? Can you talk to  -- EPU5, it's up and running, it's 47,000 tons. I'm not sure if we're quite at full capacity, but almost. But Bernard Klingenberg here will talk to the EPU5 C3 stabilization status, if you will. We didn't get your first question, but Bernard, can you take the chemicals question?\n\n---\n\nThanks, Bernard Klingenberg. The EPU5 is running, is running well. We haven't seen a full year of benefit yet. So in the coming years, we will probably see the more benefit from EPU5 and get the -- include value chain running well. There has been some benefits from C3 optimization already, but again, not at full year. And then [indiscernible] value chain that we're working on, so we'll see significant benefits in the financial year '16 for those projects, more benefits than we've seen in the last year.\n\n---\n\nDid you talk about C3 expansion? I thought you did.\n\n---\n\n[indiscernible]\n\n---\n\nBut also on C3 expansion, propylene -- basically propylene expansion, that's another 105,000 tons in FY '16 that we'll talk to everyone about on the road show as well. So that's another thing to consider. Again, we didn't get the first question. The last question, I think, was on our shale gas in Canada and the path forward. And we're still obviously very excited about that play and de-risking it to figure out how much liquids we have in the Cypress side, we've got very few rigs on. Can you add a little more color the study that we're doing?\n\n---\n\nYes. So we've committed to our Board to come with a strategy in the first quarter of calendar 2016. And we believe there is still upside value. Obviously, the current gas prices and the carry that we still have puts us under pressure there.  But the operation we have, [indiscernible] energy, we've seen productivity improvement and also cost coming down. So yes, we're obviously, still optimistic of fully utilizing the play.\n\n---\n\nThank you. Gerhard, we'll get back to your first question when we see you tomorrow. Sorry about that.\n\n---\n\nJust 2 things from my side. The one is just good performance on cost. And as you say, you've beaten the ZAR 1.5 billion target you had this year by about ZAR 1 billion. Just on next year's target, why is it still being maintained at 4.3? Is it just the case that you've actually realized cost savings ahead of time? Or have you actually realized cost savings, or actually more cost savings than you expected? So maybe just on your guidance for next year, why is that still remaining flat? And then the other one is just in terms of, again, good performance on your working capital. I'd assume a big portion of that was from revaluing your inventory at lower prices, can you maybe give us an indication of what you've been doing then and how much of that was actually revaluing the inventory?\n\n---\n\nThank you, Nishal. Let me address the first question on the Business Performance Enhancement Programme targets. And like we said, we're going to -- we'll get 4 billion in savings, up to 4 billion annual savings this financial year, with an exit rate of the 4.3 billion. We're comfortable with that number right now, and I think I will just draw your attention to the fact that we're seeing at least 4.3 billion. We think that's about as much guidance as we want to give right now. As we get closer, we'll continue to update you. But best guidance right now is at least 4.3 billion, and potential upside. I guess, I'll just leave it like that. Okay. So on working capital and inventory, what are we going there to drive that performance? Bongani?\n\n---\n\nAnd if I might respond to that, is you just assume that the cash-generated from operations [indiscernible] only come down by 5.7%, but it was helped by the working capital, as you correctly pointed out. The breakdown of the 2.5 billion benefit on capital critical, 1 billion on the Response Plan initiative, and finally, 2 billion on price.\n\n---\n\nGreat. Thanks, Bongani. And thanks, Nishal, for the questions. Thanks for calling in today. Bongani and I are looking to visiting with many of you in the coming weeks on our year-end roadshow trek. And until then, please stay safe. Thanks very much. Thanks, operator.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Jarrett Geldenhuys (Analysts)】\nJust in terms of some of the cost savings, which I suppose we can still extract further. I mean, while I'm quite interested in the mining costs, which we're very well-contained, I was wondering if you can give us a bit more color as you move into the newer mines. How much more potential savings there could be just given the fact that they will be newer and closer to -- well, I suppose closer to operations to some extent? And then also just another question quickly on gearing. I know you've given us some nice guidance between 15% and 30% for next year, can you potentially just give us some kind of color on what your FX assumptions are in that kind of a range to support that? And where you'd see that peaking given the peak part of the CapEx for the U.S.?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Edward Constable (Executives)】\nThanks, Jarrett. It's appreciated. Mining costs, I'll turn it to Paul here and Bongani. You want to take on mining costs. We've got new mines coming on, much more productive from the level later this year. And, Bongani, next year, just give us a little color on where we think mining costs are going.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Bongani Nqwababa (Executives)】\nBongani here, if I might respond to that. Our anticipation is actually in spite of the delay by  increases, we see the costing slightly below South African inflation.\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Edward Constable (Executives)】\nThank you. Gearing, guidance is 15% to 30%, Jarrett, like you said in FY '16. We see a peak gearing rates, 38% to 39%, is what we're looking at right now. And on FX, can we give some color on the assumptions? Around of -- between 12 50 and 13 50 is what we're looking at, in the assumptions on that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sean Ungerer (Analysts)】\nJust 3 questions please. Just in terms of the sort  of expected CapEx for the cracker, I know it's all fairly early days, but do you still see any sort of opportunity to bring that down? And then just secondly, with the spread obviously sort of hovering at 50 below, 50 at the moment, when does the sort of dividend cover that was revised this year become a problem for you guys, or when do you think it will at least? And then just lastly, in terms of the volumes out of Synfuels, I mean, it's really good solid production there. I think it was at 32.9. I mean, how much sort of upside do you guys sort of foresee? Or was that the sort of new sustainable number?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Edward Constable (Executives)】\nOkay, let me just see if got these right. The first one, it was on cracker capital cost and if there's any, if you will, upside on that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sean Ungerer (Analysts)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Edward Constable (Executives)】\nThe next question was on Synfuels production, was there any upside there going forward. And could you just -- did someone get the second question? It was garbled.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sean Ungerer (Analysts)】\nYes. Sorry, David...\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Edward Constable (Executives)】\nThank you. Breakeven levels at -- in operations. So we do have Steve Cornell on the line from Houston.

      "transcript_text1": "Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I'm Mike Brown from the Investment Analyst Society. On behalf of the Society, I'd like to thank Sanlam for giving us this presentation on the interim results, its review of results. So we [indiscernible] have a look at it. The -- this is always a very detailed presentation from the group, which I think will speak deeply about where the financial services are going and how they have to change to meet the changing demands that are taking place in providing people with retirement. And so we always get a lot of detail on break time and what the group's doing. But the strategic direction of our efforts, pretty much appreciated by the Society that we can come to a presentation such as this. \r\nWhy don't I just take the opportunity, I think, to -- on behalf of the Society, to thank the previous Group Chief Executive. I think he's now moved on, Dr. van Zyl [indiscernible], I think, for giving us a great, not only in taking the group into the new future that's a financial paradigm that so many of these financial services companies face, but I think carrying on the great tradition of -- obviously, people are [indiscernible], I think volatile. And I think teaching us all how to understand embedded value and how the areas of enlarging companies such as yours, and Johan has carried that on. And I'm sure Ian and the new team will do the same jobs. On behalf of the Society, I'd like to thank -- a tribute to Dr. van Zyl and also to thanks everyone for this presentation. And to call up Ian Kirk, who is the Group Chief Executive, to commence the presentation. Thank you, Ian.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Mike. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. And thanks for coming down to our new offices to be with us today as we present the results. \r\nLet me introduce some of my colleagues. I think most of you will know Kobus Möller, who's been doing this with Johan for many, many years. Kobus is the Finance Director. Wikus Olivier, he's from Investor Services and from Finance. Anton Gildenhuys, most of you will know, but he's got a new role now with us. He also, he's taking over from André Zeeman on the actuarial side of Head of Risk. He'll be also helping and answering some of the more difficult questions. \r\nSome of our board members are here. Desmond Smith, is the Chairman. Welcome, Desmond. Philip Rademeyer is here. Philip is the head of -- he's been as Mike said, for many years with the group. But he's got a very important role for us now, which is the Head of the Audit Committee. So Philip's main role is -- Philip, I think, you must have checked that the numbers that you approved and finalized yesterday, are the same ones we're presenting today. So Philip has a big role to play there. And Hubert is here with us. Hubert has just taken over -- came to us last year. Hubert has taken over running the SPF business, which you know, is the biggest single business in the group, a big generator of our results. Welcome, Hubert. And some of the other executives are also here. I think Mark Murning is here. Some of them are hiding, but I'll try and find them if there are any difficult questions. \r\nI'd also like to say big thanks on behalf of the current executive to Johan. Johan is here with us today, and as Mike said, did a fantastic job. I can assure you that the business is in far better shape than it would have taken over the leadership and the situation when Johan took over. So big thanks from all of us to Johan for his contribution.\r\nOkay. So I'm going to start talking a little bit about the strategy. This won't be a strategy talking about results, but I'll say a little bit about the operating environment, I'll say quite a bit. And then about our delivery against that. Then Kobus will take us through the numbers. And then I'll come back and talk a little bit about the priorities, essentially for the next 6 months and into the 2016 year. So I'm going to assume that you follow on the books and that you've have seen the results, which we published 8 o'clock this morning. And then we'll deal with some questions towards the end.\r\nOkay. So the business -- the strategy is -- will remain in force. I got asked this before. I've been asked it a number of times. I think people say, a new CEO, does it equal a new strategy? Not the case at Sanlam. And I'm very comfortable with the strategy that's there, that we have. And as some of you will know, I was at Sanlam in 2006, working with Kobus and with Johan and the team, putting the strategy together when we decided on these pillars. And they've largely remained in place. The 5 strategic pillars, earnings growth, operational efficiencies, capital utilization, diversification and transformation largely remained in place. Of course, we've have to adapt over the years, but that's the fundamental strategy. And it's about sustaining value and allocating the capital and putting the capital in the right places where we can get the right return. And of course, the enablers to those strategy, there's -- also there's 5 pillars. \r\nSo the message here is that we don't see a need for the change. Of course, we have to adapt. There has to be some different flavors. A lot of that would have taken place anyway, whether it was a leadership change or not. It's a team thing. We think the strategy is solid. It's well understood. It's understood externally and internally, which is very important to 19,500 people in South Africa. To get them all in the same page is not that easy. We're quite good at proving that in South Africa at the moment, but be that as it may. \r\nSo to get all the Sanlam people and Sanlam people thinking the same way is very important. So our new CEO doesn't translate into a new strategy. I think it's all up to us to do. \r\nAnd of course, if I take South Africa, that's the basis. So it's 70% of the business. It's got a solid base there. It's about optimizing the returns, dealing with the challenges that we face and moving it forward. And the challenges are significant. And this is really where I see the sort of subtle change needing to take place, to make sure that we can deal with those challenges, that we can embrace the challenges, be it regulation, be it the economic circumstances that we face, be it the threat of disruption, be it technology, be it whatever it is.  We have to obtain that leadership position it's not just important so that we earn the required return on the excess return to fund the other initiatives. It's also fundamental to what we are and how we position the group. Because if you're not strong at home and you don't win your home games, you're not as attractive to the potential opportunities on the conscience and that side. So we must never lose sight. It's been hard work over many years to gain that leadership position. We've got the solid base. We've got some excellent businesses, positive cash flows.\r\nAs far as Rest of Africa is concerned, you'll know that over the years, we've got a very good footprint now. The focus will probably change a little bit over the next few years to, what we call, more accelerated organic growth. But we think there's a significant opportunity. I'll talk a little bit about it later in terms of building a Pan African presence, and that gives us a nice opportunity. \r\nSo India and Southeast Asia, we've also been there. India is, I think in Philip's time, we went there in 2004. It was the first deal we did, and we're busy. We're even putting more capital now in the next year or so. And we're not in the very competitive segments. We tend to be in the lower income side, similar dynamics to South Africa. We've got good partners in these businesses. And we're very comfortable. It adds a diversification and a balance. And we're very positive with the opportunities in India, particularly under the new leadership there.\r\nOn the developed market side, it's a complementary strategy. You'll know well because most of you are investing, be it your own funds or your company's funds. The international aspect is important. We have to be there, for that, to offer that holistic service capability to our clients, be they retail or corporate clients.\r\nAnd it does -- it's not just the South African thing. We also go, when you go to India and you go to the Rest of Africa, you also see they also have that same need for international capabilities. So we're based in the U.K. but we've got a capability in certain other countries, Australia, New York and such, but it's largely focused on the U.K. to support the strategy. Because if you're not there, the other ones who are there, will trade against you, it's as simple as that. So if you're not there and you're not up scratch, you're going to be in trouble. So I think it is a growth strategy. It's -- I think, we may -- there may be some difficult times that we face now. South Africa is not in great shape, and as you know, I don't need to tell you that. And in emerging markets, it's also a bit tough, very volatile at the moment. Africa, may in fact, this year, may be the lowest growth for the continent for a variety of reasons. But we think over the medium to long term it's the right place. We know what we're doing, and I think the opportunities are there. We just got to see through the tougher times.\r\nSo looking now again a little bit on South Africa side. It's around operational being tight, making sure that we're in control, driving out the cost efficiencies, the capital efficiencies, managing our house well in the tough times. And it's been my                     experience. And I think the experience of the group that in tough times, you can actually accumulate quite a bit and to be there in terms of businesses that are struggling or in terms of market share because you're just doing it better. \r\nOn the distribution side, largely, our business is intermediated. But of course, the game is changing. The consumers become king. He is now dictating. He or she is dictating how they want to be serviced. So we are lifting our game significantly there and moving more into this multi-access capability. So that the retail customers can deal with us with their channel of choice. And it's a big challenge for a business that's 97 years old, and has systems and infrastructure that's more than 7 years old. But we have to do it and that's going to be very important to make sure that we can drive into the new segments. And we can retain the segments that we've got.\r\nSAM is a big opportunity, as Anton has come on board with us now and the executive, he's got this firmly under his wing. And I think how we optimize the capital in the SAM environment, and we'll start disclosing more and more of that to you as we go forward. We think there's quite a few opportunities there for us in terms of this effective Capital Management initiative.\r\nThe Emerging Markets, I've sort of indicated, the footprint is in place. I wouldn't say it's complete. There's further business opportunities, where South African businesses are moving up. All the big South African companies have got a strategy for Pan Africa supported by the government, which is a good thing. The Europeans who have a Pan-African strategy, the companies from the east, and of course, the other African countries as well. They've all got this Pan-African strategy. So the opportunity, I think, is there to do 2 things: The one is to put in place an infrastructure that can support those companies that are looking to implement to a Pan-African strategy, be it on the short-term insurance, be it on the [indiscernible], be it on the asset management or whatever. So we'll be there to support that. Of course, it means that we have to have a consistent delivery, and that's on the plan to do that, but as well as assisting those countries in the domestic market to drive out more of the footprint. The penetration levels, as you all know well, are very low. So we think this is the platform for future growth. I think it may have some headwinds, certainly, with the commodities, et cetera. And some the countries are struggling and the currencies are struggling. But we think it's in line with the client needs and the intermediary needs. We know where the business is going to come from. We know where the offices of the intermediaries are. We know what the intermediaries want from -- for them, to service them and for their clients. And we have to do that opportunity.\r\nAs far as the developed market's concerned, it's to support the South Africa and the Rest of Africa. We did -- we sold the intrinsic business. You remind -- some of you will remember last year, we're looking at replacing that business in due course and then the focus will remain on the wealth and the asset management activities. And that will be a niche approach. It's not that we're going to apply a lot more capital to build our capabilities there. It's to support. But there may be some improvements to be done. And that, of course, in all aspects of the business, we need to improve there, and we can do that. But it's not really a big capital focus of the group.\r\nOkay. So let's talk about the environment. And it's certainly tough. I don't need to tell you that. I'm sure you read the CEO survey of 1,000 South African CEOs. We -- of which I was one. Talking about the difficulties that we face and it's the most challenging times since 2009, all that sort of stuff. So we understand that. It's tough. The outlook isn't great for this year. But I do think in time, if we pull it together, and we do the sort of things that people know that we need to do, we have a plan. Our implementations needs to be lifted as a country. We need to work together, be it labor, be it government, be it all that stuff to improve the situation. But just to make the point because if you look at how we've fared in the tough times through the tough GDP where we're now at sort of 2% and below, we are in segments that benefit a little bit. At the top end, to the people who have been retiring and who are in the Sanlam Private Wealth or in the Glacier space, they've had more money to invest. That certainly helped us in terms of the flows there. And even at the bottom end in the Sky business, we've been in the public sector. Now you may have your observations as to whether the -- it's right for South Africa that the government continues to employ people and be they in the regulators or whatever. But it does certainly plays into the hands of the business like Sky. So that kind of explains why we can -- on the new business side, we can grow a little bit better than GDP. But it is competitive in South Africa. And as indicated at the beginning, we need to lift our game to retain that leadership position, that's very important.\r\nCommodity prices, certainly, is a factor. It's not just oil, it's also copper. If I look at Zambia, I mean, they've really had a tough time. That's affected us in our numbers, albeit that the base was high for last year, it's in the numbers. And that's been a struggle. Competition is increasing. It's certainly not as competitive as in South Africa, but there is a --  and the internationals are looking. Of course, some of the current volatility may keep them away for a bit longer, but certainly under radar. And we believe that we'll see through this situation. We think the long-term growth strategy remains in place. We spent a lot of time as a group, including the board just in the recent past analyzing this, is that growth story is still intact. We think it's there. And we think we have developed a capability now to deliver on that. So we think despite the challenges in the longer term, there'll be opportunity there. \r\nAnd India, we're very pleased. We have a knock there on the STFC side, which we can talk about later. That's been -- that was a bit of a setback there in terms of, if I look at the numbers, 6 months on 6 months. But we think that the Indian growth stories there, we're happy with our partners. We think that the infrastructure projects, which of course has the particular problem in FTSE. We think that will turn back on again and there will be some recovery there. \r\nAnd Malaysia, although it's a challenge at the moment, we also see some -- that, that will come right. Those countries, their growth is certainly down, but it's still above where we are in South Africa.\r\nOkay, so looking at South Africa. You'll be familiar with this. It's the growth in GDP, and it's tough. It's going to be tough for sometimes. But as I indicated earlier, we're in certain segments that are maybe not as quite as exposed. I'm happy that we're in financial services, in the particular areas that we're in, much more difficult to be in mining and to be in manufacturing, which is really under pressure. So GDP, of course, is an average and the other point to make, I think, is that our exposure to credit on a relative basis to our competitors, it's probably a bit light. And therefore, that will help us, I think, once the pressure comes on in terms of recovering on those loan books, our exposure is relatively low there. So we're watching it. At the affluent markets, the persistency numbers, I'll come to those later. Those are fine. On the bottom end, it's also fine. We have to watch the middle market. That's where the consumer, for us, it's where the challenge will be in time.\r\nOn the interest rates, you'll notice that it's up over the period. Just the impact there is negative on the VNB. And clearly, you'll see it as well on the value of in-force. But we look at that as a technical calculation. It's -- yes, it's negative and Kobus will unpack that later. But from -- on a more positive side, it does help us in the float income. But from the economy side, we have to watch that. As long as the increases that are planned and are necessary that we normalize our interest rates over a period of time for the reasons that we all understand. As long as it's a measured approach, we think it will be okay. But it's certainly -- there is positives and negatives for us that -- across the group.\r\nOn the asset management side, on the equities and bonds, we had a reasonable 6 months, 6.7%, not as good obviously as the comparable period for 2014 and the same on the bond side. But the average fee levels, the asset levels on which we earn fees has been up around about 12%, 13% over the period on a comparable basis, which does feed through to our fee income in the SPF business as well as the investments cluster. But of course, this is up to June. We've seen what's happened since we've given back all that and more. And year-to-date, 12 months to date, we're probably negative at this stage. So this is challenging, there's no doubt. \r\nOn the exchange rates, we actually -- in the 6 months, we actually appreciated against the euro and against in the Rest of Africa where we struggled. Some countries have like Zambia, for example, but other countries, too, in which we operate, also came under pressure. But against the other currencies. And India was a positive, but our result was down, so we didn't really see much value for that. I would say marginal net impact on the SA results. Kobus will probably look at that as well. Net result from financial services, up ZAR 20 million. New business volume to ZAR 80 million, which is not a big number in there -- a big impact number on the contracts, VNB down ZAR 3 million. So I think the funnel come here in the second half. We'll have to see where that transpires. \r\nIn terms of the internal factors, there's the external factors affecting our numbers. On the internal side, we did report some PIC fund moving in 2014. That certainly had a negative impact on SI performance fees, not just the PIC. We also lost performance fees in other areas as well. The PIC also announced some changes, which will come through in the second half, which I just flagged for your attention, to a further ZAR 10 billion there. \r\nBut despite the environment being challenging, on the investments cluster, there's all the necessity to do some technology projects and also to build up the capability in the retail market and on the institutional side. The retail, you can see from the fund flows, has been very positive. So the money that we spent there, building up that team and that capability has started to pay dividends, a little bit more difficult in the short term on the institutional side. But we think it's the right thing to do. So that's certainly affected the numbers internally. \r\nOn the Rest of Africa, we had some system implementation issues in Kenya, which has been negative, that we reported at the half -- at the interim stage or the April stage. The one thing I think we probably can tighten up a little bit is the period from concluding the transaction to getting the -- getting involved in the business and [indiscernible] and his team have identified that. So we'll tighten up post this sort of due diligence and make sure that we get involved early there and extracting value and the businesses after the acquisition and improving the management of the balance sheet. So those are the things that have impacted us in the Rest of Africa. \r\nAnd in India, you'll see those of you who have looked at it from STFC, which is a listed company, which is an important subsidiary of where we're invested in Shriram Capital level \r\n[Audio Gap] \r\ndevelopment. The team that are out there that running the business, I believe it's an accounting provision. But I think they'll get the money back once the funds start to flow again. And we'd have to see that. But in the meantime, we've taken the provisions there, and that's certainly affected us. Given that -- some of you will remember that in the first half of last year 2014, we also had a resolution of some issues on the third-party merger pool in the General Insurance company. So that was also a nice credit in the previous period, which didn't come through. So the results from India is down a fair bit 6 months on 6 months. And that's affected us, there's no doubt.\r\nSo overall, just before I hand over to Kobus, net operating profit of share, up 5%. And Kobus has done some calculations just to show what the underlying would have been if we take out the 11%. I'm not saying we made 11%. We made 5%. \r\nBut just to give an indication of, on a normalized basis, what that would've been. On the business volumes, we're pleased with that. 22% is a very critical outcome. We did well in the Sky business, and Kobus will unpack those numbers and then the Glacier business as well. So that's been nice. \r\nVNB, up 5%, margin largely consistent. The Group Equity Value, largely in line, given that the dividend went through in the first period of the year. And then we made a return RoGEV 13%, which is above our hurdle rate, 12.1%, but obviously not in line with what we've achieved in the prior period.\r\nWe had some underperformance on the new business side. I've indicated employee benefits had a difficult 6 months. But we've learned in that business over the years. You've seen it. It's a bit lumpy, and we have a better outlook for the second 6 months, which is the same situation we faced last year. The U.K., we are down a little bit. The -- obviously, the Intrinsic sale didn't help us there, but -- in volume terms, but we're looking at that in terms of replacing that business. And Kenya and Zambia struggled. But the other businesses did well, particularly the SPF business, really, really solid performance in a tough environment. So that was quite nice. So the new business value is up, but not significantly so.\r\nNow this is an important one. We've focused on this from -- for a long period of time. This is in the middle market, which is obviously a big generator of the profit. You'll see the numbers largely consistent. And we're watching the middle market, but we're not seeing pressure there at the moment. I mean, our advisers and the independent intermediaries who provide us business, they're following the right stuff. They're still doing the same things. The pressure is certainly on there but, at this stage, there's no indication that that's going adverse.\r\nAt the lower-income market, you see an improvement, 6-month on 6-month. But one must remember that in the first period of last year, we had that problem in the Rustenburg area, which kicked the lapses up, you'll see back -- if you look back at 2013. So the comparison is positive on the 6 months, but not as good, in fact, as in the second 6 months of last year. So we're watching that very carefully. So the main explanation for the 6 months to the second 6 months of last year is that we wrote more stop order business as opposed to the debit order Personal business in the government sector. And that was the explanation. But I mean, the numbers are not -- there's not a big change. We've continued to focus on the quality of the business. And we're watching it but, at this stage, everything looks fine. The other big kicker, of course, to our operating profits over the years has been these positive experience variance. They have continued, slightly lower, about ZAR 70 million lower than in the comparable period. But it's still positive. So -- and that's a good thing. We're obviously, working at those, that's a very important contributor to the return that we get.\r\nOn the investment performance, again, a big focus. Here, we just analyze the percentage of the assets under management that exceed benchmark. Improvement on the 3-year numbers, slight deterioration on the 5-year numbers, but we're happy with this. I mean, it's tough. We're pragmatic value players as opposed to absolute value players. That's kind of kept us afloat and kept us in line. Value has been a very tough place to be. And of course, the situation, we have to look at that forward and try and analyze what that impact would be in the second 6 months. But again, it's a testimony to the work that's been done by the investment team, and we're pleased with this performance. Also, a big driver of the operating earnings in the SPF business and through to -- on the Santam side as well.  So we're quite happy with that.\r\nDiversification has been a big story at Sanlam, as you know, over the years. So it's an indication of where we are now in terms of Group Equity Value. On the Life Insurance side, remember, that doesn't take into account the value of new business. So that's one of the main reasons why operating profits, as a percentage, it's higher at 61% versus the 50%. And the other point, I think, to mention is that the discretionary capital sits in the -- on this other. And then, obviously, we only earn out the interest return on that. And so that's a bit of a drag on the operating profit level. But it's in line with the previous period and it's certainly moving forward as we can see here.\r\nNow these are the countries that we're currently in. I think we're in the right places. There may be 1 or 2 other areas. We know -- we've got maps now. We understand where the flows -- where the business flows will come from in the other areas in pan-Africa. So we're not in every place that we could be. We know now where the international brokers -- there's been a big change there with the brokers. They've put offices right throughout the continent, and they're looking for solutions that are consistent throughout the continent. So we know that. So there's probably some more work to be done there over time. But mainly, it's about this moving up the organic growth. So for example, we had a life insurance business in Ghana. We've now got back and invested in the General Insurance business. We've entered the pension funds and the asset management. And it's about filling those blank spaces in each of those countries to drive out more value over the years, India and obviously, Southeast Asia. So this is  going to be the continued theme for Sanlam over the next few years.\r\nAnd the impact of that, you can see if you go back a number of years, it doesn't show so well in the 6-month numbers but over a period of time, this takes it back to 2003. You can see the significant impact on the VNB and on the net operating profit of the strategy that we've adopted. So I think one may have to look through this and say over the next 3 to 5 years what this could be, and that'll continue to be our approach. So I think you'll see more diversification, less reliance on South Africa and less reliance on Life Insurance as we move forward.\r\nBut it's been a good story, 17% average growth rate on the VNB and then 16% on the net operating profit, I think very credible. And we're going to stay the course on this one.\r\nIf you just look at 6 months on 6 months, the numbers are not so significant. The emerging markets are actually, on the net operating profit, are down 18% to down to 16%. You can see that on the VNB, it's a bit different, 20%, up to 22%, and it's consistent on the Group Equity Value. But there are 2 real factors here. The first is that Santam had a very good 6 months, an outstanding result from Santam, which has affected the net operating profit. And the second thing, of course, is that we've had some NOCs on the Emerging Markets side, as I've indicated, that has dragged down the performance on the 6-month basis. But it's better reflected on the VNB number. And then the currency conversions can have quite a considerable impact on the Group Equity Value but, as I said, Kobus will unpack that a little bit more.\r\nOkay. So on the capital side, just to confirm the strategy on this one. We continue to earn out the capital returns on the South African business. So you can see a nice investment return on excess capital from the dividend back from 2014. That added ZAR 661 million to the surplus capital. Remember, this is liquid capital available for investment. \r\nWe also moved some illiquid stuff and other capital releases. We've had ongoing capital efficiency on the SPF side and on the SEB side, which has had a positive impact. So it's quite a nice positive, in the times that we faced, to be able to drive out more capital out of our existing businesses. So we've added quite a bit in the 6-month period, which is nice. That brought us to 2 -- ZAR 4.6 billion. We didn't spend too much in this -- in the period, some seeding capital into the Sanlam Investment business and some small acquisitions on the Sky side in South Africa. That's only ZAR 2.85 billion. So of the ZAR 4.6 billion, we've earmarked certain acquisitions. The numbers are in the market. And some of them, on the mid scheme, it's about ZAR 700 million. We also have indicated to the market that we will be exercising or we plan to exercise our option on term general and term life, certainly, in the -- over the next few months. And that, if you add those 2 together, that's largely -- we've also announced a small transaction, SEM, impact into Zimbabwe. That accounts for about ZAR 2.1 billion. That leads to ZAR 2.5 billion. And that is really discretionary capital earmarked for new growth opportunities. And as I explained, there will be no change there and we'll continue to apply that capital into the new opportunities as they come, as we move forward. So no real change there. It's a consistent story that you've seen at year-end and at half year. \r\nSo I'm going to hand it over now to Kobus just to take you through the financial review. Thank you.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Ian. And good morning, ladies and gentlemen. It's again a pleasure to present our results to you. \r\nAs usual, to start off, just -- kind of some changes in the presentation and assumptions. Fortunately, no changes on the accounting policies, and very few in terms of how we present the results. Ian already incurred [ph] at the fact that the rates are higher. So the 40 basis points increase, both on the 9-year rates and the 5-year rates, had a negative impact on our valuations, both in the Life business and the non-Life businesses. And then on the difference between last year June and this year June and the 5-year rate, and the 20 basis points increase also had a negative impact on the value of new business, in particular, for the Sky business. But I'll share the impact of that when we get to the point.\r\nSo overall, if you look at our results, Ian also showed some of this already. Our Group Equity Value, ZAR 47; ZAR 53, if you take into account the ZAR 2.25 dividend that we paid during the 6-month period. It's a growth or a return of 6.3%. We've annualized that, 13%, which is above our hurdle rate. If you exclude the impact of the market, which we normally do to get to a normalized return, it's around 16%, which is then well above what we set as a target.\r\nThe company, Sanlam Life, in particular, remain very well capitalized. On a statutory level, if you account for the excess capital over CAR, the ratio is about 4.8%. And as you know, we manage the businesses slightly different, where we allocate specific capital to our Life businesses. And on that basis, the CAR cover was 1.7x, just for the Life businesses on their own. And in that scenario, when you look at under the SAM regime, we set a target of approximately 1.7 to 2.1. That's our current thinking of a target. And we are at the upper end of that target at the moment. Now you know that is still a work in progress, so that -- we will define that or refine that over time. But it's, at least, where we -- our current thinking is around the SAM capital requirement and our capital position, including return calculations.\r\nNet operating profit, up 5% on last year, as you've seen. I think, perhaps, just one important point to show you or to mention is that in the last year, we had a 44% growth in the first half, and the year before, 24%. So that certainly set a high base for this. So I think that is one of the reasons why this year is slightly lower. And there are also 1 or 2 specific items that, I'll also point out, that had an impact on this year in particular. But -- so in the context of that, I think we're fairly comfortable with the performance of Sanlam for the 6 months. Headline earnings, up 4%, and then volumes, almost ZAR 100 billion, and value of new business, up 5%. I'll show you some more detail on those numbers. \r\nWe start with Sanlam Personal Finance. I think Sanlam Personal Finance is still the biggest contributor of our business, the stable part of our business and I think, in the current environment, had an excellent year, a very good year. Meet our expectations. Sanlam's overall new business volumes are up 23%. Sanlam Sky had a 15% growth in volumes. That's the entry-level market business that we have. Our individual business, they grew by almost 20%. Now the base was slightly low because of the impact of the strikes in the 24 (sic) [ 2014 ] numbers, but still a very good performance from the individual life business. The group business, modest, only 2% up. Now you know we lost the Capitec business last year, so the fact that we had a biennial renewal of the [indiscernible] group scheme, more or less offset the impact of Capitec, only at about 2% growth in the group business there.\r\nIndividual life, the middle-market business, up 4%. 8% growth in recurring premiums. Good growth, in particular, on savings business, endowment policies. Single premiums this time, they're only up by 3%. I think it's partly due to the impact of what happening in the middle market, the economic environment. But we have also seen a shift of some of those singles premiums on to the Glacier platform. And you can actually see that in Glacier, we had a 30% growth in new business volumes, which is still a reflection of the level of the wealth in that segment of the market, in our equity markets. But a good -- very good performance from Glacier. And that's also reflected in the net flows of just more than ZAR 10 billion that we've achieved in SPF.\r\nValue of new business for the cluster, up 10%, Sanlam Sky, up 10%. That is where the higher discount rate had a negative impact. So if you exclude or if you calculated the similar, less discount rate, the increase there is approximately 13%, which is in line with the growth in the volumes. Also, the same with individual life in Glacier, with some more risk following the increase in the underlying volumes. You will see that we have seen some big, faster growth in some of the lower-margin businesses, in investment-tight businesses. So that's also reflected in the average margin that we have achieved for the period, in particular, in the individual life side.\r\nOperating profits for Sanlam Personal Finance, up 11%. Good performance, solid performances from Sanlam Sky and the middle-market business, individual life. In both cases, we still had some good, positive mortality experience like in the past, but we have seen some pressure on the numbers. So the levels came slightly down. Glacier continued to perform with a 22% growth. And in our Personal lines business, there, we've allowed the book to grow slightly from where it was. So we're now at about a ZAR 4.1 billion level. But the quality of the book actually improved over this period. So we're quite happy with the performance and at the risk that we run in that book. So at least, an overall return of, as I said, net operating profits growth of 11%. The Group Equity Value return, 8% on a 6-month basis. So that's plus the 17% annualized, which is well in excess of the targeted for that business. So we're really pleased with, as I said, with the Sanlam Personal Finance performance for the 6 months.\r\nEmerging Markets had a bit of a mixed bag. A more difficult period for Emerging Markets. And I think Ian also already indicated that the overall business environment is difficult in most of the countries where we operate, and then also we had some particularly individual countries or businesses that had, had a bit of headwinds in this period. If you look at the individual numbers, new business volumes, overall, up 34%. Namibia, down 17%. The main reason for that is actually lower sales in the unit trust business, collective investment schemes. It is more chunky, and we do expect some volatility in those numbers, but we also saw some competitive pressure in -- on the Life side as well in Namibia, so minus 17%. Botswana had another very good year, excellent year in terms of new business flows. Good flows on the investment side, but also the annuity book grew by 30% for the year, which is an excellent set of results there. \r\nIn the Rest of Africa, we only show a 7% increase in volumes. Now that is the area where we had -- Ian also referred to Kenya, where we had some system implementation problems earlier in the year, which impacted from the volumes there. Zambia also went through a very difficult period in a number of areas, currency-wise, copper prices and some changes in the political environment there, so the elections that they had, floods. So if you exclude those 2 countries from the numbers there, with the increase in the volumes, the Rest of Africa was still above 30%, so the trend that we normally expect from those businesses.\r\nIndia/Malaysia, our Asian businesses, good growth there, 48%, in particular, good growth from the Life business in India. And then we also have a first-time contribution from our MCIS business of about ZAR 148 million in the current year numbers. \r\nThe net flows, a bit disappointing on -- if you look at that of, well, minus ZAR 9 billion. The single biggest impact is really the fact that we had the BPOPF, the Botswana Public Officers Pension Fund, which grew about ZAR 11 billion from the Botswana Asset Manager last year. That accounts for the substantial part of what we've lost in terms of net flows. \r\nThe value of new business increased by 13%, a figure that is also impacted by the Kenyan numbers and the Zambia numbers, in particular, that were down on last year. And then the margins, slightly lower than last year, partly because of the underlying performance and the change in mix. But the biggest reason being the fact that it now includes MCIS for the first time in their numbers, which also brought down the average margin that we achieved with MCIS. The margins are almost similar to South Africa, not what we encountered in the rest of Africa. \r\nThe profit contribution from Emerging Markets, on a net basis, down 10%. I think that maybe is the one disappointing number or we got used to quite big growth numbers from the same. So again, we have a base effect there as well. But if you look at the individual businesses or regions there, Namibia, only up 1%. Last year, we had an annuity mismatch profit of about ZAR 35 million that came through in the numbers there. So if you exclude that, still a good performance from Namibia. \r\nBotswana, again, another solid set of results, up 18%. In the Rest of Africa, the Zambia profit situation or the -- had a major impact on the performance there. If you exclude Zambia, still above 30% growth. And then the big impact for the year is really what happened in India. And Ian referred to the fact that we had a release of provisions of around ZAR 70 million last year that we've created against the third-party book in Shriram General. And this year, we've created a provision of about ZAR 45 million for the years -- the Equipment Finance company in India, and that's in the Shriram Group, which is almost ZAR 120 million swing between the 2 years. So there's substantial impact on the performance there.\r\nAnd what happened in India is also reflected in the Group Equity Value and our evaluation there. So if we'll return slightly lower than our expected return, again, if you normalize the number and we still achieve our target for Emerging Markets.\r\nThe Sanlam Investment flows, net flows of ZAR 2.6 billion. Some good flows in South Africa, in particular on the retail side. In the international business, that's where we've lost money. And also, the BPOPF, we've managed some ZAR 3.5 billion -- or ZAR 3 billion of the Botswana money in our international businesses. So -- and you can see that in the ZAR 4 billion net outflows there. And also, we do see the result of selling Intrinsic. We had some flows from Intrinsic in the past, and that -- we've seen the withdrawal of some of those mandates onto our platform. So that's reflected in that number. And as Ian also said, we are taking steps to actually replace those inflows, but for the moment, we still show those negative numbers. \r\nOn the insurance side, Employee Benefits in South Africa is a difficult environment, in particular in the group risk side, which is the more profitable side of the business. So we don't see many of those funds moving at the moment. A lot of pressure on pricing of those. The increase in the Employee Benefits flows are really top-up premium that we received on our annuity book that we -- or the big pension outsourcing that we had had last year. As we implement the book and we balance the detail of the book, there are some top-up payments, and so we've received ZAR 230 million top-up payment in this year that is also reflected in those numbers. \r\nSanlam U.K.'s insurance business is affected by the Intrinsic sale as well, but also, we've reclassified some of the low-margin business to the non-life businesses in this year. So it's not a truly comparable number, the U.K. number. But the net effect of what happened on the insurance side is also reflected in the value of new business, which rolled down, and also in the margin that we booked for those businesses.\r\nThe profit contribution from Sanlam Investments is down 5%. And as you know, a big part of -- still of what  SPF -- of what Sanlam Investments earned is in performance fees. Last year, on our investment management level, we had performance fees of around ZAR 70 million. That's down to ZAR 20 million in the current period. A big part of that is money that we've -- or fees that we've earned on the PRC mandate that we've lost, so a major impact on their results. And then also, in the Capital Management business, where we earned carry interest when we sold some of the private equity business, there was also a drop from -- of about ZAR 20 million between the 2 periods, accounting for the major part of the lower profit. \r\nIn Investment management, as Ian indicated, we also spent some money on the outsourcing projects of our collective investment scheme and some additional capacity on the marketing side and distribution side. So the cost base there is about ZAR 36 million higher than normal because of that.  And then in Employee Benefits, we incurred the new business strain on the additional top-up premium on the pension outsourced business. So a number of one-off-type items. \r\nIf you exclude that from the results, just to get a more comparable increase, it's around 12%, which is more reflecting the growth in the underlying assets under management. So on that basis, I think it's -- we're also comfortable of the results. The Group Equity Value or the return for the period is about -- almost 10% for the 6 months. So it's above 20% for the full -- or an annualized basis, which is an excellent performance and well in excess of the target set for that business. \r\nNow the Santam results. You've seen already an excellent year for -- 6-month period for Santam, underwriting margin of less than 9% on an already high base of 7.4% that they've achieved last year, an increase of 17% contribution to our results, increasing the contribution.  The return on our investment is really based on the movement in the price of Santam, and the price remained more or less stable from December to June. So the 2.5% return that we reflect there is essentially just the dividend that Santam paid in the period.\r\nSo if I look at the combined numbers then for business flows, up 22%, in particular good flows from the investment side. Life insurance, a bit lower than our normal growth, essentially due to what happened in the U.K. and also in the Employee Benefits business. On the net flows, you could see the big impact there being made by the withdrawal from the BPOPF, combined number close to ZAR 15 billion, which accounts for most of the drop in the net flows that we've seen for the period. Value of new business, about 5%, but strong contribution from Personal Finance and Emerging Markets, but somewhat offset by the Employee Benefits in the U.K. numbers. And at the bottom, you can see that on a comparable basis, the average margin model is in line with what we've achieved last year.\r\nTotal operating profit up 15%, just a strong solid performance from Personal Finance. And if you take into account -- and Santam, obviously. And if you take into account the one-off items that we had for the period, we believe a more comparable increase since last year to 11% then year-on-year.\r\nThe market returns -- investment returns were relatively flat year-on-year, slightly down on last year. The base is a bit higher, so on average, we -- for the total portfolio, our increase in investment returns is just 2%, which is also on normalized headline earnings growth of also just 4%. And if you account for the IFRS treatment of Sanlam shares held by the policyholder funds, kind of ZAR 38 million adjustment, headline earnings of ZAR 4.7 billion is up 6% on last year for the 6 months.\r\nOur Group Equity Value, ZAR 97 billion at the end of June or ZAR 47.53. That is a return of 6.2% or about 13%, as I've indicated. Our group operations, a return of 7% or 15%, diluted to some extent by our corporate costs and our discretionary capital. I think the one item to point out there in that minus ZAR 263 million is that we also show there the cost of the shares that we deliver on our share incentive scheme, so the rise in the Sanlam share price. Obviously, the actual cost that impacts on our return is also higher, and so that had a negative impact on the finish you can see in that number.\r\nThis slide just shows the buildup of the Group Equity Value return. The first 3 columns there, the expected return on our life business, the ZAR 2.4 billion, combination of what we earn in our in-force book and also what we turn on investment returns. We expect to -- on investment returns, so ZAR 2.4 billion. To that, we add the value of new business of ZAR 655 million and positive experience variances of ZAR 408 million. It's slightly lower than last year. The bulk of that is still mortality -- positive mortality experience. And then there's a small operating assumption change to get to the normalized or adjusted life earnings of ZAR 3.5 billion.\r\nAnd if you add to that what we -- the expected return or the normalized return on our non-life business of ZAR 3.6 billion, that gives you the ZAR 7.1 billion or ZAR 7.2 billion or a 15.8% return -- normalized return on our Group Equity Value. The markets added another ZAR 211 million. And then economic interest rate assumption changes, they're lowering due to higher interest rates and other adjustments that are connected to valuations, bringing the actual return then down to ZAR 5.9 billion or 13%. \r\nSo if you look at our experience over the last number of years now, our outperformance relative to our target, which is still a long-bond rate plus 4%. For the current year, it's 12.1%. The level of outperformance is actually small for the 6-month period. In this period, the market actually reduces the return from 16% to 13%. In the past few years, we actually had a positive kicker as a result of the market. So if you look on average over the last few years, we outperformed our target by about 5%. Around 2.5% of that was due to the markets and the rest due to operational outperformance.\r\nSo with that, I'll hand you back to Ian to deal with the some of the priorities for the remainder of the year.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Kobus. I mean, taking you through the strategy, I indicated that we'll stay the course. There won't be any significant change, some tightening up here or there. But I'll now take you through the priorities for the second 6 months by each of the clusters.\r\nOkay. So let's start with Sanlam Personal Finance. We had a very incredible result. I had the opportunity myself to run that business for the first 6 months of the year in my transitioning with Johan. Hubert has now taken over that business. And of course, the priority in the times that we're in is to ensure that those businesses are agile, they're cost efficient, market-oriented to make sure that in the tough times, we can grab some market share and make sure that we can get the returns that we need to.  And I've been really impressed with how that business is delivering, both in terms of the distribution -- the traditional agency distribution, the support that we're getting from the independents, the way that they've got involved and improved the risk business performance in the middle and the affluent markets and the way that all the businesses are working together. \r\nI indicated in -- at the -- when I spoke in March of this year that we do see the opportunity to drive out further operational efficiencies on the distribution side and very importantly, on the operation side. You know that we have a Sky business. We have a middle-market business, which we call SILSS, and then we have the affluent business called Glacier. And Hubert and the team have identified some opportunities there and then are working away on those, which -- to ensure that we remain on top of our game in operational efficiency terms and that we can -- not just on the cost side, but also on the client service side that we can deliver. \r\nAnd the regulatory changes is a big pressure point there, as you know. We have SAM. We're certainly in a good shape in terms of SAM. And we think, ultimately, that will provide some pricing discipline into the market, both on the life side and on the general insurance side. But RDR is certainly a challenge, and I'm pleased to see that the regulator is adopting quite a responsible approach actually in implementing the RDR. He's got certain priorities he wants to see achieved. And we see those same priorities, and we're working well. We're workshop-ing all the stuff through. \r\nSo I think we'll have a reasonable balanced outlook and implementation over the next few years, probably through to 2017, before we really start making some significant changes to the distribution footprint that we've got. We see a lot of opportunity in that. It's going to be tough for everybody, tough for the intermediaries. We've got a number of operating models to make sure that those intermediaries stay onboard with us and the ones who are sort of losing their way a little bit will come onboard with us. So we see some positives certainly on the RDR side.\r\nI've talked about how the business really got in touch with the risk business, which has been very, very nice because that's profitable for us. On the Sanlam Sky side, building a more realistic relationship. Progress has been made on the savings side. The tax-free savings account has really opened up something for us to be able to deliver on the education need of that market and helps us to build a more holistic relationship with the market. So Anne and the team are really busy with that. \r\nAnd Glacier is just -- I mean, as Kobus showed you the figures, I mean, it's a tremendous business. The real challenge for us, of course, now is to retain our position. It's getting tougher there. Others have seen how well we've done to retain our leadership position in South Africa and to find the next territories where we can apply that model in Africa and in India.  So the business is in great shape. It's got new leadership and new passion and energy, and we're very confident that they'll be able to retain the leadership position, in fact, put distance between us and the competitors. \r\nThat's certainly the challenge, and I think the team will be up to that. But that will be the focus for the next 6 months. \r\nOn the Emerging Markets side, I talked earlier about the shift to accelerated organic growth, more partnerships, supplying those partnerships to distribution with the banks and the retailers that we've got into more countries, expanding the product range and building capability. We've got the support systems -- support structures in place. The people are getting to understand this better. The smaller business that we've acquired more recently in the general insurance side, we've focused in hard there. \r\nSantam is really coming to the party to assist us there in driving up the value in those businesses. It's going to take time. They're going to have to do all this when the wind is in their face. But we think it's hard work, but it's worthwhile work. And not everyone is doing it, I can tell you that. And I think we can build something very, very special out over time.  There's no changes to the territories. We're comfortable with that. Heinie has indicated that there are some opportunities in the Francophone and the Lusophone. It's been on his list for a while. \r\nAnd the main thing, of course, is on the HR side, to ensure that we have to deliver this consistent service level to Sanlam footprint, and what people would expect from Sanlam, be they retail clients or corporate clients. It takes time. It's -- we have the same issue, I suppose you'll say, in South Africa in that the people in Bellville don't always think the same as the people from Limpopo. And the people in [indiscernible] are a bit different, and Eastern Cape wants to be a bit different. And the Free State is still trying to work out what they're all about. So we have those diversity issues in South Africa, but they become even more significant, of course, as you go into Africa. And that's the real challenges on the HR side. But we're well into it, and I think we've got good plans. And this will take time and -- but I think we'll -- I'm very confident we'll get there. \r\nOn the investment side, of course, it's about investment performance. I think we've shown in the tough times that our model is working. It's certainly working for the in-house funds, and it's working largely for the third-party funds as well. We've spent money on systems there. We've spent money in restructuring the core SIM business around retail flows and institutional flows, getting good support on the retail side, still to deliver more on the institutional side. The implemented solutions, I think, will be a very positive thing for us. \r\nIt's a big part of the retail distribution review. It will change the way the intermediaries look at their clients' affairs, look at risk profile of funds, and there'll be less shifting from flavor of the month based on prior performance to a more appropriate solid benchmark performance. That will sort of play into the hands of, let's say, the more traditional asset management things and some of the new style ones. We think passive will become more and more important core part of portfolios. And alternative investments, we're busy with transformation and people developments, all that sort of good solid stuff that we're busy with there, too, to show at the returns. \r\nSantam, a fantastic performance under the new leadership, I'll have to say. Well, I thought we had a great year last year. We had an even better first 6 months this year. So well done to the team. We've just spent 2 days with the team. It's just fantastic to see the level of passion on how to challenge the business more and more, how to get involved in the opportunities in Africa, drive out the improvement in India. It's very, very encouraging, very exciting. Obviously, they're busy with SAM implementation as well. \r\nLizé is -- you all know from Lizé her very tight focus in the SPF business. She hasn't lessened that, I can assure you. The Santam people are beginning to feel that now. And you can see even in the short term, some improvements on the acquisition cost ratio. But of course, the whole thing is to balance growth and profit. Anyone can sell 2-bob ice creams for 1 bob. Some of the competitors are still trying to do it. I don't know why, and I salute 1 or 2 of them, but -- which creates some opportunity. But that discipline around that, making sure that new underwriting system in the core C&P business gets implemented effectively so they can deal with the challenges provided by the direct model, particularly on the underwriting side. \r\nAnd of course, lifting the program that we've had in place with the municipalities for a considerable period of time. There's really -- we think it makes a difference. It's not just stuff that we talk about. It actually does make a difference on the ground. The municipal situation is far from ideal, but we all have -- it's -- we just have to work together. It's as simple as that, bringing in new partners now, getting to more municipalities. So the team are really focused in on that. It can't be done overnight, but it make -- it definitely makes a difference. \r\nOkay. So that's the cluster look. You'll have read our commentary on the outlook. We think it will be tough. The growth in most markets will be, most likely, below the longer-term potential, a South African thing, an emerging market thing. But we still believe in that story. We think we'll transition that through. The growth rates in these territories will recover over time. The penetration levels, which are really low, will drive us in. \r\nIt's quite interesting if you look at the figures for Nigeria, as Kobus showed. Nigeria has gone through heartache. But when the penetration levels are so low as they are, you can still get the business up because you're coming off such a low base from a penetration point of view. So the bigger businesses, actually, when the wind is in their face, they suffer more and particularly, when you translate to where the currency collapses. So we're very confident with that, but it'll be tough for the next 6 months, no doubt. \r\nInvestment market volatility, I mean, you all know as well is I where is this thing going to end up. We are positive for the 6 months. We've gained it all back, plus a bit more. We'll have to see. If I look at the operating earnings, I talked about some pressure there. But on the headline earnings, of course, depending on where the market goes, that will really drive the headline earnings number in the second 6 months. And of course, we had a high base in the second half of 2014. \r\nThere were some challenges in the SEM business, which Heinie and his team are really on top of, and I think we'll obviously learn from that. I think these are good opportunities. On the transaction side, the -- I'm pleased to say that the -- we call it AfroCentric, but it's really the Medscheme transaction, is progressing well. We've had some very positives there, so I think we'll be able to make some announcements there in the very short-term future -- in the very short term. \r\nOn the Shriram capital side, it's our clear intent, there's definitely value there in the group, for us to exercise those options. We're very positive on both those businesses. You've seen the effect on the life side. It's tough there for them in the life side with the changes in the regulations. But they really got onboard, and it's a very positive result in the 6 months from the Shriram's life business, the Shriram general business. It's about just doing the hard work and retaining our leadership position with the truck finance stuff and then building out the diversification of that business. So we're positive on that.\r\nWe do have some excess capital, and there are some opportunities around that, and to deal with the regulatory changes. Just to say it again, the fact that we're in the U.K., and it is very much of a support strategy as opposed to a build-out strategy. But it definitely helps us on the regulatory side. We get that first look, we see what comes, we can see what works and what doesn't work. So we can use that in our discussions with the regulator to try and deal with some of these unintended consequences. Regulation is a big issue. It's a big feature. It's one of Anton's core responsibilities. Because that's such a big stakeholder now, that we've had to pull it together under Anton. But it's a relative thing. There are opportunities with this regulatory change, and we're certainly allowed to that. \r\nSo thanks very much. Thanks for coming to listen to what we had to say. I think we've got some time for questions. If I can just ask my colleagues, Kobus and Anton Gildenhuys, to join us. And then whatever questions, if we can take those. Thank you.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Mike Brown (Executives)】\nGood morning, ladies and gentlemen. I'm Mike Brown from the Investment Analyst Society. On behalf of the Society, I'd like to thank Sanlam for giving us this presentation on the interim results, its review of results. So we [indiscernible] have a look at it. The -- this is always a very detailed presentation from the group, which I think will speak deeply about where the financial services are going and how they have to change to meet the changing demands that are taking place in providing people with retirement. And so we always get a lot of detail on break time and what the group's doing. But the strategic direction of our efforts, pretty much appreciated by the Society that we can come to a presentation such as this. \r\nWhy don't I just take the opportunity, I think, to -- on behalf of the Society, to thank the previous Group Chief Executive. I think he's now moved on, Dr. van Zyl [indiscernible], I think, for giving us a great, not only in taking the group into the new future that's a financial paradigm that so many of these financial services companies face, but I think carrying on the great tradition of -- obviously, people are [indiscernible], I think volatile. And I think teaching us all how to understand embedded value and how the areas of enlarging companies such as yours, and Johan has carried that on. And I'm sure Ian and the new team will do the same jobs. On behalf of the Society, I'd like to thank -- a tribute to Dr. van Zyl and also to thanks everyone for this presentation. And to call up Ian Kirk, who is the Group Chief Executive, to commence the presentation. Thank you, Ian.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Ian Kirk (Executives)】\nThank you, Mike. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. And thanks for coming down to our new offices to be with us today as we present the results. \r\nLet me introduce some of my colleagues. I think most of you will know Kobus Möller, who's been doing this with Johan for many, many years. Kobus is the Finance Director. Wikus Olivier, he's from Investor Services and from Finance. Anton Gildenhuys, most of you will know, but he's got a new role now with us. He also, he's taking over from André Zeeman on the actuarial side of Head of Risk. He'll be also helping and answering some of the more difficult questions. \r\nSome of our board members are here. Desmond Smith, is the Chairman. Welcome, Desmond. Philip Rademeyer is here. Philip is the head of -- he's been as Mike said, for many years with the group. But he's got a very important role for us now, which is the Head of the Audit Committee. So Philip's main role is -- Philip, I think, you must have checked that the numbers that you approved and finalized yesterday, are the same ones we're presenting today. So Philip has a big role to play there. And Hubert is here with us. Hubert has just taken over -- came to us last year. Hubert has taken over running the SPF business, which you know, is the biggest single business in the group, a big generator of our results. Welcome, Hubert. And some of the other executives are also here. I think Mark Murning is here. Some of them are hiding, but I'll try and find them if there are any difficult questions. \r\nI'd also like to say big thanks on behalf of the current executive to Johan. Johan is here with us today, and as Mike said, did a fantastic job. I can assure you that the business is in far better shape than it would have taken over the leadership and the situation when Johan took over. So big thanks from all of us to Johan for his contribution.\r\nOkay. So I'm going to start talking a little bit about the strategy. This won't be a strategy talking about results, but I'll say a little bit about the operating environment, I'll say quite a bit. And then about our delivery against that. Then Kobus will take us through the numbers. And then I'll come back and talk a little bit about the priorities, essentially for the next 6 months and into the 2016 year. So I'm going to assume that you follow on the books and that you've have seen the results, which we published 8 o'clock this morning. And then we'll deal with some questions towards the end.\r\nOkay. So the business -- the strategy is -- will remain in force. I got asked this before. I've been asked it a number of times. I think people say, a new CEO, does it equal a new strategy? Not the case at Sanlam. And I'm very comfortable with the strategy that's there, that we have. And as some of you will know, I was at Sanlam in 2006, working with Kobus and with Johan and the team, putting the strategy together when we decided on these pillars. And they've largely remained in place. The 5 strategic pillars, earnings growth, operational efficiencies, capital utilization, diversification and transformation largely remained in place. Of course, we've have to adapt over the years, but that's the fundamental strategy. And it's about sustaining value and allocating the capital and putting the capital in the right places where we can get the right return. And of course, the enablers to those strategy, there's -- also there's 5 pillars. \r\nSo the message here is that we don't see a need for the change. Of course, we have to adapt. There has to be some different flavors. A lot of that would have taken place anyway, whether it was a leadership change or not. It's a team thing. We think the strategy is solid. It's well understood. It's understood externally and internally, which is very important to 19,500 people in South Africa. To get them all in the same page is not that easy. We're quite good at proving that in South Africa at the moment, but be that as it may. \r\nSo to get all the Sanlam people and Sanlam people thinking the same way is very important. So our new CEO doesn't translate into a new strategy. I think it's all up to us to do. \r\nAnd of course, if I take South Africa, that's the basis. So it's 70% of the business. It's got a solid base there. It's about optimizing the returns, dealing with the challenges that we face and moving it forward. And the challenges are significant. And this is really where I see the sort of subtle change needing to take place, to make sure that we can deal with those challenges, that we can embrace the challenges, be it regulation, be it the economic circumstances that we face, be it the threat of disruption, be it technology, be it whatever it is.  We have to obtain that leadership position it's not just important so that we earn the required return on the excess return to fund the other initiatives. It's also fundamental to what we are and how we position the group. Because if you're not strong at home and you don't win your home games, you're not as attractive to the potential opportunities on the conscience and that side. So we must never lose sight. It's been hard work over many years to gain that leadership position. We've got the solid base. We've got some excellent businesses, positive cash flows.\r\nAs far as Rest of Africa is concerned, you'll know that over the years, we've got a very good footprint now. The focus will probably change a little bit over the next few years to, what we call, more accelerated organic growth. But we think there's a significant opportunity. I'll talk a little bit about it later in terms of building a Pan African presence, and that gives us a nice opportunity. \r\nSo India and Southeast Asia, we've also been there. India is, I think in Philip's time, we went there in 2004. It was the first deal we did, and we're busy. We're even putting more capital now in the next year or so. And we're not in the very competitive segments. We tend to be in the lower income side, similar dynamics to South Africa. We've got good partners in these businesses. And we're very comfortable. It adds a diversification and a balance. And we're very positive with the opportunities in India, particularly under the new leadership there.\r\nOn the developed market side, it's a complementary strategy. You'll know well because most of you are investing, be it your own funds or your company's funds. The international aspect is important. We have to be there, for that, to offer that holistic service capability to our clients, be they retail or corporate clients.\r\nAnd it does -- it's not just the South African thing. We also go, when you go to India and you go to the Rest of Africa, you also see they also have that same need for international capabilities. So we're based in the U.K. but we've got a capability in certain other countries, Australia, New York and such, but it's largely focused on the U.K. to support the strategy. Because if you're not there, the other ones who are there, will trade against you, it's as simple as that. So if you're not there and you're not up scratch, you're going to be in trouble. So I think it is a growth strategy. It's -- I think, we may -- there may be some difficult times that we face now. South Africa is not in great shape, and as you know, I don't need to tell you that. And in emerging markets, it's also a bit tough, very volatile at the moment. Africa, may in fact, this year, may be the lowest growth for the continent for a variety of reasons. But we think over the medium to long term it's the right place. We know what we're doing, and I think the opportunities are there. We just got to see through the tougher times.\r\nSo looking now again a little bit on South Africa side. It's around operational being tight, making sure that we're in control, driving out the cost efficiencies, the capital efficiencies, managing our house well in the tough times. And it's been my                     experience. And I think the experience of the group that in tough times, you can actually accumulate quite a bit and to be there in terms of businesses that are struggling or in terms of market share because you're just doing it better. \r\nOn the distribution side, largely, our business is intermediated. But of course, the game is changing. The consumers become king. He is now dictating. He or she is dictating how they want to be serviced. So we are lifting our game significantly there and moving more into this multi-access capability. So that the retail customers can deal with us with their channel of choice. And it's a big challenge for a business that's 97 years old, and has systems and infrastructure that's more than 7 years old. But we have to do it and that's going to be very important to make sure that we can drive into the new segments. And we can retain the segments that we've got.\r\nSAM is a big opportunity, as Anton has come on board with us now and the executive, he's got this firmly under his wing. And I think how we optimize the capital in the SAM environment, and we'll start disclosing more and more of that to you as we go forward. We think there's quite a few opportunities there for us in terms of this effective Capital Management initiative.\r\nThe Emerging Markets, I've sort of indicated, the footprint is in place. I wouldn't say it's complete. There's further business opportunities, where South African businesses are moving up. All the big South African companies have got a strategy for Pan Africa supported by the government, which is a good thing. The Europeans who have a Pan-African strategy, the companies from the east, and of course, the other African countries as well. They've all got this Pan-African strategy. So the opportunity, I think, is there to do 2 things: The one is to put in place an infrastructure that can support those companies that are looking to implement to a Pan-African strategy, be it on the short-term insurance, be it on the [indiscernible], be it on the asset management or whatever. So we'll be there to support that. Of course, it means that we have to have a consistent delivery, and that's on the plan to do that, but as well as assisting those countries in the domestic market to drive out more of the footprint. The penetration levels, as you all know well, are very low. So we think this is the platform for future growth. I think it may have some headwinds, certainly, with the commodities, et cetera. And some the countries are struggling and the currencies are struggling. But we think it's in line with the client needs and the intermediary needs. We know where the business is going to come from. We know where the offices of the intermediaries are. We know what the intermediaries want from -- for them, to service them and for their clients. And we have to do that opportunity.\r\nAs far as the developed market's concerned, it's to support the South Africa and the Rest of Africa. We did -- we sold the intrinsic business. You remind -- some of you will remember last year, we're looking at replacing that business in due course and then the focus will remain on the wealth and the asset management activities. And that will be a niche approach. It's not that we're going to apply a lot more capital to build our capabilities there. It's to support. But there may be some improvements to be done. And that, of course, in all aspects of the business, we need to improve there, and we can do that. But it's not really a big capital focus of the group.\r\nOkay. So let's talk about the environment. And it's certainly tough. I don't need to tell you that. I'm sure you read the CEO survey of 1,000 South African CEOs. We -- of which I was one. Talking about the difficulties that we face and it's the most challenging times since 2009, all that sort of stuff. So we understand that. It's tough. The outlook isn't great for this year. But I do think in time, if we pull it together, and we do the sort of things that people know that we need to do, we have a plan. Our implementations needs to be lifted as a country. We need to work together, be it labor, be it government, be it all that stuff to improve the situation. But just to make the point because if you look at how we've fared in the tough times through the tough GDP where we're now at sort of 2% and below, we are in segments that benefit a little bit. At the top end, to the people who have been retiring and who are in the Sanlam Private Wealth or in the Glacier space, they've had more money to invest. That certainly helped us in terms of the flows there. And even at the bottom end in the Sky business, we've been in the public sector. Now you may have your observations as to whether the -- it's right for South Africa that the government continues to employ people and be they in the regulators or whatever. But it does certainly plays into the hands of the business like Sky. So that kind of explains why we can -- on the new business side, we can grow a little bit better than GDP. But it is competitive in South Africa. And as indicated at the beginning, we need to lift our game to retain that leadership position, that's very important.\r\nCommodity prices, certainly, is a factor. It's not just oil, it's also copper. If I look at Zambia, I mean, they've really had a tough time. That's affected us in our numbers, albeit that the base was high for last year, it's in the numbers. And that's been a struggle. Competition is increasing. It's certainly not as competitive as in South Africa, but there is a --  and the internationals are looking. Of course, some of the current volatility may keep them away for a bit longer, but certainly under radar. And we believe that we'll see through this situation. We think the long-term growth strategy remains in place. We spent a lot of time as a group, including the board just in the recent past analyzing this, is that growth story is still intact. We think it's there. And we think we have developed a capability now to deliver on that. So we think despite the challenges in the longer term, there'll be opportunity there. \r\nAnd India, we're very pleased. We have a knock there on the STFC side, which we can talk about later. That's been -- that was a bit of a setback there in terms of, if I look at the numbers, 6 months on 6 months. But we think that the Indian growth stories there, we're happy with our partners. We think that the infrastructure projects, which of course has the particular problem in FTSE. We think that will turn back on again and there will be some recovery there. \r\nAnd Malaysia, although it's a challenge at the moment, we also see some -- that, that will come right. Those countries, their growth is certainly down, but it's still above where we are in South Africa.\r\nOkay, so looking at South Africa. You'll be familiar with this. It's the growth in GDP, and it's tough. It's going to be tough for sometimes. But as I indicated earlier, we're in certain segments that are maybe not as quite as exposed. I'm happy that we're in financial services, in the particular areas that we're in, much more difficult to be in mining and to be in manufacturing, which is really under pressure. So GDP, of course, is an average and the other point to make, I think, is that our exposure to credit on a relative basis to our competitors, it's probably a bit light. And therefore, that will help us, I think, once the pressure comes on in terms of recovering on those loan books, our exposure is relatively low there. So we're watching it. At the affluent markets, the persistency numbers, I'll come to those later. Those are fine. On the bottom end, it's also fine. We have to watch the middle market. That's where the consumer, for us, it's where the challenge will be in time.\r\nOn the interest rates, you'll notice that it's up over the period. Just the impact there is negative on the VNB. And clearly, you'll see it as well on the value of in-force. But we look at that as a technical calculation. It's -- yes, it's negative and Kobus will unpack that later. But from -- on a more positive side, it does help us in the float income. But from the economy side, we have to watch that. As long as the increases that are planned and are necessary that we normalize our interest rates over a period of time for the reasons that we all understand. As long as it's a measured approach, we think it will be okay. But it's certainly -- there is positives and negatives for us that -- across the group.\r\nOn the asset management side, on the equities and bonds, we had a reasonable 6 months, 6.7%, not as good obviously as the comparable period for 2014 and the same on the bond side. But the average fee levels, the asset levels on which we earn fees has been up around about 12%, 13% over the period on a comparable basis, which does feed through to our fee income in the SPF business as well as the investments cluster. But of course, this is up to June. We've seen what's happened since we've given back all that and more. And year-to-date, 12 months to date, we're probably negative at this stage. So this is challenging, there's no doubt. \r\nOn the exchange rates, we actually -- in the 6 months, we actually appreciated against the euro and against in the Rest of Africa where we struggled. Some countries have like Zambia, for example, but other countries, too, in which we operate, also came under pressure. But against the other currencies. And India was a positive, but our result was down, so we didn't really see much value for that. I would say marginal net impact on the SA results. Kobus will probably look at that as well. Net result from financial services, up ZAR 20 million. New business volume to ZAR 80 million, which is not a big number in there -- a big impact number on the contracts, VNB down ZAR 3 million. So I think the funnel come here in the second half. We'll have to see where that transpires. \r\nIn terms of the internal factors, there's the external factors affecting our numbers. On the internal side, we did report some PIC fund moving in 2014. That certainly had a negative impact on SI performance fees, not just the PIC. We also lost performance fees in other areas as well. The PIC also announced some changes, which will come through in the second half, which I just flagged for your attention, to a further ZAR 10 billion there. \r\nBut despite the environment being challenging, on the investments cluster, there's all the necessity to do some technology projects and also to build up the capability in the retail market and on the institutional side. The retail, you can see from the fund flows, has been very positive. So the money that we spent there, building up that team and that capability has started to pay dividends, a little bit more difficult in the short term on the institutional side. But we think it's the right thing to do. So that's certainly affected the numbers internally. \r\nOn the Rest of Africa, we had some system implementation issues in Kenya, which has been negative, that we reported at the half -- at the interim stage or the April stage. The one thing I think we probably can tighten up a little bit is the period from concluding the transaction to getting the -- getting involved in the business and [indiscernible] and his team have identified that. So we'll tighten up post this sort of due diligence and make sure that we get involved early there and extracting value and the businesses after the acquisition and improving the management of the balance sheet. So those are the things that have impacted us in the Rest of Africa. \r\nAnd in India, you'll see those of you who have looked at it from STFC, which is a listed company, which is an important subsidiary of where we're invested in Shriram Capital level \r\n[Audio Gap] \r\ndevelopment. The team that are out there that running the business, I believe it's an accounting provision. But I think they'll get the money back once the funds start to flow again. And we'd have to see that. But in the meantime, we've taken the provisions there, and that's certainly affected us. Given that -- some of you will remember that in the first half of last year 2014, we also had a resolution of some issues on the third-party merger pool in the General Insurance company. So that was also a nice credit in the previous period, which didn't come through. So the results from India is down a fair bit 6 months on 6 months. And that's affected us, there's no doubt.\r\nSo overall, just before I hand over to Kobus, net operating profit of share, up 5%. And Kobus has done some calculations just to show what the underlying would have been if we take out the 11%. I'm not saying we made 11%. We made 5%. \r\nBut just to give an indication of, on a normalized basis, what that would've been. On the business volumes, we're pleased with that. 22% is a very critical outcome. We did well in the Sky business, and Kobus will unpack those numbers and then the Glacier business as well. So that's been nice. \r\nVNB, up 5%, margin largely consistent. The Group Equity Value, largely in line, given that the dividend went through in the first period of the year. And then we made a return RoGEV 13%, which is above our hurdle rate, 12.1%, but obviously not in line with what we've achieved in the prior period.\r\nWe had some underperformance on the new business side. I've indicated employee benefits had a difficult 6 months. But we've learned in that business over the years. You've seen it. It's a bit lumpy, and we have a better outlook for the second 6 months, which is the same situation we faced last year. The U.K., we are down a little bit. The -- obviously, the Intrinsic sale didn't help us there, but -- in volume terms, but we're looking at that in terms of replacing that business. And Kenya and Zambia struggled. But the other businesses did well, particularly the SPF business, really, really solid performance in a tough environment. So that was quite nice. So the new business value is up, but not significantly so.\r\nNow this is an important one. We've focused on this from -- for a long period of time. This is in the middle market, which is obviously a big generator of the profit. You'll see the numbers largely consistent. And we're watching the middle market, but we're not seeing pressure there at the moment. I mean, our advisers and the independent intermediaries who provide us business, they're following the right stuff. They're still doing the same things. The pressure is certainly on there but, at this stage, there's no indication that that's going adverse.\r\nAt the lower-income market, you see an improvement, 6-month on 6-month. But one must remember that in the first period of last year, we had that problem in the Rustenburg area, which kicked the lapses up, you'll see back -- if you look back at 2013. So the comparison is positive on the 6 months, but not as good, in fact, as in the second 6 months of last year. So we're watching that very carefully. So the main explanation for the 6 months to the second 6 months of last year is that we wrote more stop order business as opposed to the debit order Personal business in the government sector. And that was the explanation. But I mean, the numbers are not -- there's not a big change. We've continued to focus on the quality of the business. And we're watching it but, at this stage, everything looks fine. The other big kicker, of course, to our operating profits over the years has been these positive experience variance. They have continued, slightly lower, about ZAR 70 million lower than in the comparable period. But it's still positive. So -- and that's a good thing. We're obviously, working at those, that's a very important contributor to the return that we get.\r\nOn the investment performance, again, a big focus. Here, we just analyze the percentage of the assets under management that exceed benchmark. Improvement on the 3-year numbers, slight deterioration on the 5-year numbers, but we're happy with this. I mean, it's tough. We're pragmatic value players as opposed to absolute value players. That's kind of kept us afloat and kept us in line. Value has been a very tough place to be. And of course, the situation, we have to look at that forward and try and analyze what that impact would be in the second 6 months. But again, it's a testimony to the work that's been done by the investment team, and we're pleased with this performance. Also, a big driver of the operating earnings in the SPF business and through to -- on the Santam side as well.  So we're quite happy with that.\r\nDiversification has been a big story at Sanlam, as you know, over the years. So it's an indication of where we are now in terms of Group Equity Value. On the Life Insurance side, remember, that doesn't take into account the value of new business. So that's one of the main reasons why operating profits, as a percentage, it's higher at 61% versus the 50%. And the other point, I think, to mention is that the discretionary capital sits in the -- on this other. And then, obviously, we only earn out the interest return on that. And so that's a bit of a drag on the operating profit level. But it's in line with the previous period and it's certainly moving forward as we can see here.\r\nNow these are the countries that we're currently in. I think we're in the right places. There may be 1 or 2 other areas. We know -- we've got maps now. We understand where the flows -- where the business flows will come from in the other areas in pan-Africa. So we're not in every place that we could be. We know now where the international brokers -- there's been a big change there with the brokers. They've put offices right throughout the continent, and they're looking for solutions that are consistent throughout the continent. So we know that. So there's probably some more work to be done there over time. But mainly, it's about this moving up the organic growth. So for example, we had a life insurance business in Ghana. We've now got back and invested in the General Insurance business. We've entered the pension funds and the asset management. And it's about filling those blank spaces in each of those countries to drive out more value over the years, India and obviously, Southeast Asia. So this is  going to be the continued theme for Sanlam over the next few years.\r\nAnd the impact of that, you can see if you go back a number of years, it doesn't show so well in the 6-month numbers but over a period of time, this takes it back to 2003. You can see the significant impact on the VNB and on the net operating profit of the strategy that we've adopted. So I think one may have to look through this and say over the next 3 to 5 years what this could be, and that'll continue to be our approach. So I think you'll see more diversification, less reliance on South Africa and less reliance on Life Insurance as we move forward.\r\nBut it's been a good story, 17% average growth rate on the VNB and then 16% on the net operating profit, I think very credible. And we're going to stay the course on this one.\r\nIf you just look at 6 months on 6 months, the numbers are not so significant. The emerging markets are actually, on the net operating profit, are down 18% to down to 16%. You can see that on the VNB, it's a bit different, 20%, up to 22%, and it's consistent on the Group Equity Value. But there are 2 real factors here. The first is that Santam had a very good 6 months, an outstanding result from Santam, which has affected the net operating profit. And the second thing, of course, is that we've had some NOCs on the Emerging Markets side, as I've indicated, that has dragged down the performance on the 6-month basis. But it's better reflected on the VNB number. And then the currency conversions can have quite a considerable impact on the Group Equity Value but, as I said, Kobus will unpack that a little bit more.\r\nOkay. So on the capital side, just to confirm the strategy on this one. We continue to earn out the capital returns on the South African business. So you can see a nice investment return on excess capital from the dividend back from 2014. That added ZAR 661 million to the surplus capital. Remember, this is liquid capital available for investment. \r\nWe also moved some illiquid stuff and other capital releases. We've had ongoing capital efficiency on the SPF side and on the SEB side, which has had a positive impact. So it's quite a nice positive, in the times that we faced, to be able to drive out more capital out of our existing businesses. So we've added quite a bit in the 6-month period, which is nice. That brought us to 2 -- ZAR 4.6 billion. We didn't spend too much in this -- in the period, some seeding capital into the Sanlam Investment business and some small acquisitions on the Sky side in South Africa. That's only ZAR 2.85 billion. So of the ZAR 4.6 billion, we've earmarked certain acquisitions. The numbers are in the market. And some of them, on the mid scheme, it's about ZAR 700 million. We also have indicated to the market that we will be exercising or we plan to exercise our option on term general and term life, certainly, in the -- over the next few months. And that, if you add those 2 together, that's largely -- we've also announced a small transaction, SEM, impact into Zimbabwe. That accounts for about ZAR 2.1 billion. That leads to ZAR 2.5 billion. And that is really discretionary capital earmarked for new growth opportunities. And as I explained, there will be no change there and we'll continue to apply that capital into the new opportunities as they come, as we move forward. So no real change there. It's a consistent story that you've seen at year-end and at half year. \r\nSo I'm going to hand it over now to Kobus just to take you through the financial review. Thank you.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Kobus Möller (Executives)】\nThank you, Ian. And good morning, ladies and gentlemen. It's again a pleasure to present our results to you. \r\nAs usual, to start off, just -- kind of some changes in the presentation and assumptions. Fortunately, no changes on the accounting policies, and very few in terms of how we present the results. Ian already incurred [ph] at the fact that the rates are higher. So the 40 basis points increase, both on the 9-year rates and the 5-year rates, had a negative impact on our valuations, both in the Life business and the non-Life businesses. And then on the difference between last year June and this year June and the 5-year rate, and the 20 basis points increase also had a negative impact on the value of new business, in particular, for the Sky business. But I'll share the impact of that when we get to the point.\r\nSo overall, if you look at our results, Ian also showed some of this already. Our Group Equity Value, ZAR 47; ZAR 53, if you take into account the ZAR 2.25 dividend that we paid during the 6-month period. It's a growth or a return of 6.3%. We've annualized that, 13%, which is above our hurdle rate. If you exclude the impact of the market, which we normally do to get to a normalized return, it's around 16%, which is then well above what we set as a target.\r\nThe company, Sanlam Life, in particular, remain very well capitalized. On a statutory level, if you account for the excess capital over CAR, the ratio is about 4.8%. And as you know, we manage the businesses slightly different, where we allocate specific capital to our Life businesses. And on that basis, the CAR cover was 1.7x, just for the Life businesses on their own. And in that scenario, when you look at under the SAM regime, we set a target of approximately 1.7 to 2.1. That's our current thinking of a target. And we are at the upper end of that target at the moment. Now you know that is still a work in progress, so that -- we will define that or refine that over time. But it's, at least, where we -- our current thinking is around the SAM capital requirement and our capital position, including return calculations.\r\nNet operating profit, up 5% on last year, as you've seen. I think, perhaps, just one important point to show you or to mention is that in the last year, we had a 44% growth in the first half, and the year before, 24%. So that certainly set a high base for this. So I think that is one of the reasons why this year is slightly lower. And there are also 1 or 2 specific items that, I'll also point out, that had an impact on this year in particular. But -- so in the context of that, I think we're fairly comfortable with the performance of Sanlam for the 6 months. Headline earnings, up 4%, and then volumes, almost ZAR 100 billion, and value of new business, up 5%. I'll show you some more detail on those numbers. \r\nWe start with Sanlam Personal Finance. I think Sanlam Personal Finance is still the biggest contributor of our business, the stable part of our business and I think, in the current environment, had an excellent year, a very good year. Meet our expectations. Sanlam's overall new business volumes are up 23%. Sanlam Sky had a 15% growth in volumes. That's the entry-level market business that we have. Our individual business, they grew by almost 20%. Now the base was slightly low because of the impact of the strikes in the 24 (sic) [ 2014 ] numbers, but still a very good performance from the individual life business. The group business, modest, only 2% up. Now you know we lost the Capitec business last year, so the fact that we had a biennial renewal of the [indiscernible] group scheme, more or less offset the impact of Capitec, only at about 2% growth in the group business there.\r\nIndividual life, the middle-market business, up 4%. 8% growth in recurring premiums. Good growth, in particular, on savings business, endowment policies. Single premiums this time, they're only up by 3%. I think it's partly due to the impact of what happening in the middle market, the economic environment. But we have also seen a shift of some of those singles premiums on to the Glacier platform. And you can actually see that in Glacier, we had a 30% growth in new business volumes, which is still a reflection of the level of the wealth in that segment of the market, in our equity markets. But a good -- very good performance from Glacier. And that's also reflected in the net flows of just more than ZAR 10 billion that we've achieved in SPF.\r\nValue of new business for the cluster, up 10%, Sanlam Sky, up 10%. That is where the higher discount rate had a negative impact. So if you exclude or if you calculated the similar, less discount rate, the increase there is approximately 13%, which is in line with the growth in the volumes. Also, the same with individual life in Glacier, with some more risk following the increase in the underlying volumes. You will see that we have seen some big, faster growth in some of the lower-margin businesses, in investment-tight businesses. So that's also reflected in the average margin that we have achieved for the period, in particular, in the individual life side.\r\nOperating profits for Sanlam Personal Finance, up 11%. Good performance, solid performances from Sanlam Sky and the middle-market business, individual life. In both cases, we still had some good, positive mortality experience like in the past, but we have seen some pressure on the numbers. So the levels came slightly down. Glacier continued to perform with a 22% growth. And in our Personal lines business, there, we've allowed the book to grow slightly from where it was. So we're now at about a ZAR 4.1 billion level. But the quality of the book actually improved over this period. So we're quite happy with the performance and at the risk that we run in that book. So at least, an overall return of, as I said, net operating profits growth of 11%. The Group Equity Value return, 8% on a 6-month basis. So that's plus the 17% annualized, which is well in excess of the targeted for that business. So we're really pleased with, as I said, with the Sanlam Personal Finance performance for the 6 months.\r\nEmerging Markets had a bit of a mixed bag. A more difficult period for Emerging Markets. And I think Ian also already indicated that the overall business environment is difficult in most of the countries where we operate, and then also we had some particularly individual countries or businesses that had, had a bit of headwinds in this period. If you look at the individual numbers, new business volumes, overall, up 34%. Namibia, down 17%. The main reason for that is actually lower sales in the unit trust business, collective investment schemes. It is more chunky, and we do expect some volatility in those numbers, but we also saw some competitive pressure in -- on the Life side as well in Namibia, so minus 17%. Botswana had another very good year, excellent year in terms of new business flows. Good flows on the investment side, but also the annuity book grew by 30% for the year, which is an excellent set of results there. \r\nIn the Rest of Africa, we only show a 7% increase in volumes. Now that is the area where we had -- Ian also referred to Kenya, where we had some system implementation problems earlier in the year, which impacted from the volumes there. Zambia also went through a very difficult period in a number of areas, currency-wise, copper prices and some changes in the political environment there, so the elections that they had, floods. So if you exclude those 2 countries from the numbers there, with the increase in the volumes, the Rest of Africa was still above 30%, so the trend that we normally expect from those businesses.\r\nIndia/Malaysia, our Asian businesses, good growth there, 48%, in particular, good growth from the Life business in India. And then we also have a first-time contribution from our MCIS business of about ZAR 148 million in the current year numbers. \r\nThe net flows, a bit disappointing on -- if you look at that of, well, minus ZAR 9 billion. The single biggest impact is really the fact that we had the BPOPF, the Botswana Public Officers Pension Fund, which grew about ZAR 11 billion from the Botswana Asset Manager last year. That accounts for the substantial part of what we've lost in terms of net flows. \r\nThe value of new business increased by 13%, a figure that is also impacted by the Kenyan numbers and the Zambia numbers, in particular, that were down on last year. And then the margins, slightly lower than last year, partly because of the underlying performance and the change in mix. But the biggest reason being the fact that it now includes MCIS for the first time in their numbers, which also brought down the average margin that we achieved with MCIS. The margins are almost similar to South Africa, not what we encountered in the rest of Africa. \r\nThe profit contribution from Emerging Markets, on a net basis, down 10%. I think that maybe is the one disappointing number or we got used to quite big growth numbers from the same. So again, we have a base effect there as well. But if you look at the individual businesses or regions there, Namibia, only up 1%. Last year, we had an annuity mismatch profit of about ZAR 35 million that came through in the numbers there. So if you exclude that, still a good performance from Namibia. \r\nBotswana, again, another solid set of results, up 18%. In the Rest of Africa, the Zambia profit situation or the -- had a major impact on the performance there. If you exclude Zambia, still above 30% growth. And then the big impact for the year is really what happened in India. And Ian referred to the fact that we had a release of provisions of around ZAR 70 million last year that we've created against the third-party book in Shriram General. And this year, we've created a provision of about ZAR 45 million for the years -- the Equipment Finance company in India, and that's in the Shriram Group, which is almost ZAR 120 million swing between the 2 years. So there's substantial impact on the performance there.\r\nAnd what happened in India is also reflected in the Group Equity Value and our evaluation there. So if we'll return slightly lower than our expected return, again, if you normalize the number and we still achieve our target for Emerging Markets.\r\nThe Sanlam Investment flows, net flows of ZAR 2.6 billion. Some good flows in South Africa, in particular on the retail side. In the international business, that's where we've lost money. And also, the BPOPF, we've managed some ZAR 3.5 billion -- or ZAR 3 billion of the Botswana money in our international businesses. So -- and you can see that in the ZAR 4 billion net outflows there. And also, we do see the result of selling Intrinsic. We had some flows from Intrinsic in the past, and that -- we've seen the withdrawal of some of those mandates onto our platform. So that's reflected in that number. And as Ian also said, we are taking steps to actually replace those inflows, but for the moment, we still show those negative numbers. \r\nOn the insurance side, Employee Benefits in South Africa is a difficult environment, in particular in the group risk side, which is the more profitable side of the business. So we don't see many of those funds moving at the moment. A lot of pressure on pricing of those. The increase in the Employee Benefits flows are really top-up premium that we received on our annuity book that we -- or the big pension outsourcing that we had had last year. As we implement the book and we balance the detail of the book, there are some top-up payments, and so we've received ZAR 230 million top-up payment in this year that is also reflected in those numbers. \r\nSanlam U.K.'s insurance business is affected by the Intrinsic sale as well, but also, we've reclassified some of the low-margin business to the non-life businesses in this year. So it's not a truly comparable number, the U.K. number. But the net effect of what happened on the insurance side is also reflected in the value of new business, which rolled down, and also in the margin that we booked for those businesses.\r\nThe profit contribution from Sanlam Investments is down 5%. And as you know, a big part of -- still of what  SPF -- of what Sanlam Investments earned is in performance fees. Last year, on our investment management level, we had performance fees of around ZAR 70 million. That's down to ZAR 20 million in the current period. A big part of that is money that we've -- or fees that we've earned on the PRC mandate that we've lost, so a major impact on their results. And then also, in the Capital Management business, where we earned carry interest when we sold some of the private equity business, there was also a drop from -- of about ZAR 20 million between the 2 periods, accounting for the major part of the lower profit. \r\nIn Investment management, as Ian indicated, we also spent some money on the outsourcing projects of our collective investment scheme and some additional capacity on the marketing side and distribution side. So the cost base there is about ZAR 36 million higher than normal because of that.  And then in Employee Benefits, we incurred the new business strain on the additional top-up premium on the pension outsourced business. So a number of one-off-type items. \r\nIf you exclude that from the results, just to get a more comparable increase, it's around 12%, which is more reflecting the growth in the underlying assets under management. So on that basis, I think it's -- we're also comfortable of the results. The Group Equity Value or the return for the period is about -- almost 10% for the 6 months. So it's above 20% for the full -- or an annualized basis, which is an excellent performance and well in excess of the target set for that business. \r\nNow the Santam results. You've seen already an excellent year for -- 6-month period for Santam, underwriting margin of less than 9% on an already high base of 7.4% that they've achieved last year, an increase of 17% contribution to our results, increasing the contribution.  The return on our investment is really based on the movement in the price of Santam, and the price remained more or less stable from December to June. So the 2.5% return that we reflect there is essentially just the dividend that Santam paid in the period.\r\nSo if I look at the combined numbers then for business flows, up 22%, in particular good flows from the investment side. Life insurance, a bit lower than our normal growth, essentially due to what happened in the U.K. and also in the Employee Benefits business. On the net flows, you could see the big impact there being made by the withdrawal from the BPOPF, combined number close to ZAR 15 billion, which accounts for most of the drop in the net flows that we've seen for the period. Value of new business, about 5%, but strong contribution from Personal Finance and Emerging Markets, but somewhat offset by the Employee Benefits in the U.K. numbers. And at the bottom, you can see that on a comparable basis, the average margin model is in line with what we've achieved last year.\r\nTotal operating profit up 15%, just a strong solid performance from Personal Finance. And if you take into account -- and Santam, obviously. And if you take into account the one-off items that we had for the period, we believe a more comparable increase since last year to 11% then year-on-year.\r\nThe market returns -- investment returns were relatively flat year-on-year, slightly down on last year. The base is a bit higher, so on average, we -- for the total portfolio, our increase in investment returns is just 2%, which is also on normalized headline earnings growth of also just 4%. And if you account for the IFRS treatment of Sanlam shares held by the policyholder funds, kind of ZAR 38 million adjustment, headline earnings of ZAR 4.7 billion is up 6% on last year for the 6 months.\r\nOur Group Equity Value, ZAR 97 billion at the end of June or ZAR 47.53. That is a return of 6.2% or about 13%, as I've indicated. Our group operations, a return of 7% or 15%, diluted to some extent by our corporate costs and our discretionary capital. I think the one item to point out there in that minus ZAR 263 million is that we also show there the cost of the shares that we deliver on our share incentive scheme, so the rise in the Sanlam share price. Obviously, the actual cost that impacts on our return is also higher, and so that had a negative impact on the finish you can see in that number.\r\nThis slide just shows the buildup of the Group Equity Value return. The first 3 columns there, the expected return on our life business, the ZAR 2.4 billion, combination of what we earn in our in-force book and also what we turn on investment returns. We expect to -- on investment returns, so ZAR 2.4 billion. To that, we add the value of new business of ZAR 655 million and positive experience variances of ZAR 408 million. It's slightly lower than last year. The bulk of that is still mortality -- positive mortality experience. And then there's a small operating assumption change to get to the normalized or adjusted life earnings of ZAR 3.5 billion.\r\nAnd if you add to that what we -- the expected return or the normalized return on our non-life business of ZAR 3.6 billion, that gives you the ZAR 7.1 billion or ZAR 7.2 billion or a 15.8% return -- normalized return on our Group Equity Value. The markets added another ZAR 211 million. And then economic interest rate assumption changes, they're lowering due to higher interest rates and other adjustments that are connected to valuations, bringing the actual return then down to ZAR 5.9 billion or 13%. \r\nSo if you look at our experience over the last number of years now, our outperformance relative to our target, which is still a long-bond rate plus 4%. For the current year, it's 12.1%. The level of outperformance is actually small for the 6-month period. In this period, the market actually reduces the return from 16% to 13%. In the past few years, we actually had a positive kicker as a result of the market. So if you look on average over the last few years, we outperformed our target by about 5%. Around 2.5% of that was due to the markets and the rest due to operational outperformance.\r\nSo with that, I'll hand you back to Ian to deal with the some of the priorities for the remainder of the year.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Ian Kirk (Executives)】\nThank you, Kobus. I mean, taking you through the strategy, I indicated that we'll stay the course. There won't be any significant change, some tightening up here or there. But I'll now take you through the priorities for the second 6 months by each of the clusters.\r\nOkay. So let's start with Sanlam Personal Finance. We had a very incredible result. I had the opportunity myself to run that business for the first 6 months of the year in my transitioning with Johan. Hubert has now taken over that business. And of course, the priority in the times that we're in is to ensure that those businesses are agile, they're cost efficient, market-oriented to make sure that in the tough times, we can grab some market share and make sure that we can get the returns that we need to.  And I've been really impressed with how that business is delivering, both in terms of the distribution -- the traditional agency distribution, the support that we're getting from the independents, the way that they've got involved and improved the risk business performance in the middle and the affluent markets and the way that all the businesses are working together. \r\nI indicated in -- at the -- when I spoke in March of this year that we do see the opportunity to drive out further operational efficiencies on the distribution side and very importantly, on the operation side. You know that we have a Sky business. We have a middle-market business, which we call SILSS, and then we have the affluent business called Glacier. And Hubert and the team have identified some opportunities there and then are working away on those, which -- to ensure that we remain on top of our game in operational efficiency terms and that we can -- not just on the cost side, but also on the client service side that we can deliver. \r\nAnd the regulatory changes is a big pressure point there, as you know. We have SAM. We're certainly in a good shape in terms of SAM. And we think, ultimately, that will provide some pricing discipline into the market, both on the life side and on the general insurance side. But RDR is certainly a challenge, and I'm pleased to see that the regulator is adopting quite a responsible approach actually in implementing the RDR. He's got certain priorities he wants to see achieved. And we see those same priorities, and we're working well. We're workshop-ing all the stuff through. \r\nSo I think we'll have a reasonable balanced outlook and implementation over the next few years, probably through to 2017, before we really start making some significant changes to the distribution footprint that we've got. We see a lot of opportunity in that. It's going to be tough for everybody, tough for the intermediaries. We've got a number of operating models to make sure that those intermediaries stay onboard with us and the ones who are sort of losing their way a little bit will come onboard with us. So we see some positives certainly on the RDR side.\r\nI've talked about how the business really got in touch with the risk business, which has been very, very nice because that's profitable for us. On the Sanlam Sky side, building a more realistic relationship. Progress has been made on the savings side. The tax-free savings account has really opened up something for us to be able to deliver on the education need of that market and helps us to build a more holistic relationship with the market. So Anne and the team are really busy with that. \r\nAnd Glacier is just -- I mean, as Kobus showed you the figures, I mean, it's a tremendous business. The real challenge for us, of course, now is to retain our position. It's getting tougher there. Others have seen how well we've done to retain our leadership position in South Africa and to find the next territories where we can apply that model in Africa and in India.  So the business is in great shape. It's got new leadership and new passion and energy, and we're very confident that they'll be able to retain the leadership position, in fact, put distance between us and the competitors. \r\nThat's certainly the challenge, and I think the team will be up to that. But that will be the focus for the next 6 months. \r\nOn the Emerging Markets side, I talked earlier about the shift to accelerated organic growth, more partnerships, supplying those partnerships to distribution with the banks and the retailers that we've got into more countries, expanding the product range and building capability. We've got the support systems -- support structures in place. The people are getting to understand this better. The smaller business that we've acquired more recently in the general insurance side, we've focused in hard there. \r\nSantam is really coming to the party to assist us there in driving up the value in those businesses. It's going to take time. They're going to have to do all this when the wind is in their face. But we think it's hard work, but it's worthwhile work. And not everyone is doing it, I can tell you that. And I think we can build something very, very special out over time.  There's no changes to the territories. We're comfortable with that. Heinie has indicated that there are some opportunities in the Francophone and the Lusophone. It's been on his list for a while. \r\nAnd the main thing, of course, is on the HR side, to ensure that we have to deliver this consistent service level to Sanlam footprint, and what people would expect from Sanlam, be they retail clients or corporate clients. It takes time. It's -- we have the same issue, I suppose you'll say, in South Africa in that the people in Bellville don't always think the same as the people from Limpopo. And the people in [indiscernible] are a bit different, and Eastern Cape wants to be a bit different. And the Free State is still trying to work out what they're all about. So we have those diversity issues in South Africa, but they become even more significant, of course, as you go into Africa. And that's the real challenges on the HR side. But we're well into it, and I think we've got good plans. And this will take time and -- but I think we'll -- I'm very confident we'll get there. \r\nOn the investment side, of course, it's about investment performance. I think we've shown in the tough times that our model is working. It's certainly working for the in-house funds, and it's working largely for the third-party funds as well. We've spent money on systems there. We've spent money in restructuring the core SIM business around retail flows and institutional flows, getting good support on the retail side, still to deliver more on the institutional side. The implemented solutions, I think, will be a very positive thing for us. \r\nIt's a big part of the retail distribution review. It will change the way the intermediaries look at their clients' affairs, look at risk profile of funds, and there'll be less shifting from flavor of the month based on prior performance to a more appropriate solid benchmark performance. That will sort of play into the hands of, let's say, the more traditional asset management things and some of the new style ones. We think passive will become more and more important core part of portfolios. And alternative investments, we're busy with transformation and people developments, all that sort of good solid stuff that we're busy with there, too, to show at the returns. \r\nSantam, a fantastic performance under the new leadership, I'll have to say. Well, I thought we had a great year last year. We had an even better first 6 months this year. So well done to the team. We've just spent 2 days with the team. It's just fantastic to see the level of passion on how to challenge the business more and more, how to get involved in the opportunities in Africa, drive out the improvement in India. It's very, very encouraging, very exciting. Obviously, they're busy with SAM implementation as well. \r\nLizé is -- you all know from Lizé her very tight focus in the SPF business. She hasn't lessened that, I can assure you. The Santam people are beginning to feel that now. And you can see even in the short term, some improvements on the acquisition cost ratio. But of course, the whole thing is to balance growth and profit. Anyone can sell 2-bob ice creams for 1 bob. Some of the competitors are still trying to do it. I don't know why, and I salute 1 or 2 of them, but -- which creates some opportunity. But that discipline around that, making sure that new underwriting system in the core C&P business gets implemented effectively so they can deal with the challenges provided by the direct model, particularly on the underwriting side. \r\nAnd of course, lifting the program that we've had in place with the municipalities for a considerable period of time. There's really -- we think it makes a difference. It's not just stuff that we talk about. It actually does make a difference on the ground. The municipal situation is far from ideal, but we all have -- it's -- we just have to work together. It's as simple as that, bringing in new partners now, getting to more municipalities. So the team are really focused in on that. It can't be done overnight, but it make -- it definitely makes a difference. \r\nOkay. So that's the cluster look. You'll have read our commentary on the outlook. We think it will be tough. The growth in most markets will be, most likely, below the longer-term potential, a South African thing, an emerging market thing. But we still believe in that story. We think we'll transition that through. The growth rates in these territories will recover over time. The penetration levels, which are really low, will drive us in. \r\nIt's quite interesting if you look at the figures for Nigeria, as Kobus showed. Nigeria has gone through heartache. But when the penetration levels are so low as they are, you can still get the business up because you're coming off such a low base from a penetration point of view. So the bigger businesses, actually, when the wind is in their face, they suffer more and particularly, when you translate to where the currency collapses. So we're very confident with that, but it'll be tough for the next 6 months, no doubt. \r\nInvestment market volatility, I mean, you all know as well is I where is this thing going to end up. We are positive for the 6 months. We've gained it all back, plus a bit more. We'll have to see. If I look at the operating earnings, I talked about some pressure there. But on the headline earnings, of course, depending on where the market goes, that will really drive the headline earnings number in the second 6 months. And of course, we had a high base in the second half of 2014. \r\nThere were some challenges in the SEM business, which Heinie and his team are really on top of, and I think we'll obviously learn from that. I think these are good opportunities. On the transaction side, the -- I'm pleased to say that the -- we call it AfroCentric, but it's really the Medscheme transaction, is progressing well. We've had some very positives there, so I think we'll be able to make some announcements there in the very short-term future -- in the very short term. \r\nOn the Shriram capital side, it's our clear intent, there's definitely value there in the group, for us to exercise those options. We're very positive on both those businesses. You've seen the effect on the life side. It's tough there for them in the life side with the changes in the regulations. But they really got onboard, and it's a very positive result in the 6 months from the Shriram's life business, the Shriram general business. It's about just doing the hard work and retaining our leadership position with the truck finance stuff and then building out the diversification of that business. So we're positive on that.\r\nWe do have some excess capital, and there are some opportunities around that, and to deal with the regulatory changes. Just to say it again, the fact that we're in the U.K., and it is very much of a support strategy as opposed to a build-out strategy. But it definitely helps us on the regulatory side. We get that first look, we see what comes, we can see what works and what doesn't work. So we can use that in our discussions with the regulator to try and deal with some of these unintended consequences. Regulation is a big issue. It's a big feature. It's one of Anton's core responsibilities. Because that's such a big stakeholder now, that we've had to pull it together under Anton. But it's a relative thing. There are opportunities with this regulatory change, and we're certainly allowed to that. \r\nSo thanks very much. Thanks for coming to listen to what we had to say. I think we've got some time for questions. If I can just ask my colleagues, Kobus and Anton Gildenhuys, to join us. And then whatever questions, if we can take those. Thank you.",
      "transcript_text3": "Can you give us some color on the whole Medscheme deal, is this an outsourcing efficiency thing? Are there other business to be derived from this deal with Medscheme/AfroCentric?\n\n---\n\nOkay. Looking at it from our side first, there's a base of clients there where there's not a lot of overlap with what we've got, okay? So we have certain products that we can market into that base over a period of time, and that's additional for us. And there's also the opportunity with the data, that we can use their data with our data to come with more appropriate life insurance pricing into the future and then sort of using the health care information that we've got, the managed care processes in our life insurance business as well. We won't be the first to do that, but I think we can certainly push ahead there and make our Life business a bit more efficient. Also, from the distribution perspective, we'll be able to give that a more credible health care offering to our distribution force. So that's what we see from our side, those 3 things. From the Medscheme side, they also didn't have the distribution capability, that was the one thing that they were missing. They were good on the administration on the managed care. They weren't so great on getting the organic growth, and that was really the opportunity. So for them, we bring them the distribution and the solid backing. And there's been some early wins there, where our participation, our future participation, they've been able to use their advantage in getting some new closed schemes. So we see -- it'll take time, but we see a nice opportunity there. Remember, we were very light in health care. It was the one area within our strategy in South Africa that we were very light, so it's a nice opportunity.\n\n---\n\nAnd maybe credentials there, Ian?\n\n---\n\nYes. Well, they're strong on their side. So they've been controlled by black empowerment. The listed company is black-controlled. That certainly helps them in their marketing. But our position doesn't really add to them there, to be honest with you. They're already at the levels they want...\n\n---\n\nAnd there's been all [ph], from our own your point of view, in terms of BEE credentials?\n\n---\n\nNo, not from them through to us, we're fine on the ownership side as well. No.\r\nKobus, I don't know if you've got...\n\n---\n\n[indiscernible]\n\n---\n\nMr. Kirk, I'm referring to the fund income statement on pages 30 and 31 of the annexures. I have some questions and comments. May I start with the line item investment surpluses and ask why under Sanlam Personal Finance, there has been such a massive swing from ZAR 997 million positive to ZAR 429 million negative, and that this has taken through to corporate column but with the brackets reversed.\n\n---\n\nThose are essentially just intercompany, that's why we actually reverse it on consolidation again. So it's purely intercompany movements of funds and returns. So it's actually -- that's why on a net group basis, it's a net 0. So I think it's an accounting entry more than anything else.\n\n---\n\nI'm still puzzled as to why it suddenly, out of nowhere, as it were, it appears from -- as a massive turnaround from 1 year to the next. Was a decision taken to restructure in some way?\n\n---\n\nNo. I think it'll be the underlying movement of certain investments, we -- movements in the equity markets change or Sanlam and Santam investment may have increased last year, and it's down this year. And as our -- intergroup, such movements, really, that we actually just conquer [ph] out on a group level. It's essentially due to the market movement.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Then I'd like to refer to the column Sanlam Emerging Markets. Mention has already been made of, and I quote, \"Headwinds in both Zambia and India, amongst other Emerging Markets.\" However, when I look at the first line item, financial services income, I see an increase in business of approximately 20%. But offsetting that, the next line item is sales remuneration, which shows an increase of 45%, suggesting that to obtain the 20% income that your sales staff, in some way, had to go out and buy business. Is this a correct interpretation?\n\n---\n\nThe buy part, but not that we buy business. I think what is happening in this class sort of business, is we're continuing to add more businesses. So for this time, for the first time, we've added the MCIS business in Malaysia, for example. So we will have an increase in the sales -- or the income side, but also in the expense side as we keep on adding more businesses. So it's more acquisitions than absolute increases in the cost.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Now coupled with that, I have to refer now to admin costs. Again, under Emerging Markets, admin costs have gone up enormously, 56%.\n\n---\n\nThat will be the same argument.\n\n---\n\nAnd is that the same type of discussion?\n\n---\n\nYes, yes, yes.\n\n---\n\nAll right. Now under admin costs, generally, there's been an increase of 12% in the total against financial services income of only 9%. Offsetting all that is the sparkling performance, as you said, Mr. Kirk, from Santam. Now Santam showed admin costs increase of ZAR 48 million against financial services income of ZAR 631 million. So the disparity amongst the other divisions compared to Santam's become enormous. Why have the other divisions fallen so far behind Santam's performance?\n\n---\n\nI think the argument is -- well, the answer is fairly similar. I think Santam is a more stable business. And what happened there is that -- is substantial increase in the underwriting profit. The admin cost didn't incur in the same rate. So that would obviously result in that. For the group overall, as we make acquisitions, that obviously will have an increase in the overall administration cost, so that the -- last year and this year is not really comparable because of the increase in the number of businesses that we've add in the rest of it, the Emerging Markets in particular, as you've pointed out already.\n\n---\n\nAnd then finally, just going back to the Emerging Markets section. I noticed that operating margins, for the reasons just discussed, has gone down from 54.4% to 46.5%. What can we expect in the future? Is it a question now of having to find your way through these Emerging Markets in the beginning and then perhaps getting a better result as things settle down?\n\n---\n\nI don't think so. I think there were some specific things that we've explained, and that's why we said 11% would be a more appropriate operating earnings thing. There are some lessons. I said at the beginning, once we've completed the due diligence work, we can maybe a bit quicker work into the implementation mode at improving the businesses we invest in. Now the concern for me is not that. I think we know how to get value out of these businesses. I mean, we know where we can create the value. The issue for me is in the short term with the headwinds, that's really it. When one has a portfolio -- I mean, we have 40 businesses in that cluster. 1 or 2 things are going to operationally -- yes. So once we get a bit more scale into it. I think the impact of the one-offs will probably be a bit lower as the scale builds up. But I think we know what we're about. We're working through it. Our partners know we're about, they're taking us on board. The business opportunities are there, but you're probably going to have to see it through 2, 3 years. It's not an overnight story, it's a 3-, 5-year story.\n\n---\n\nCorrect.\n\n---\n\nFinally, please, Mr. Kirk, without referring specifically to numbers, I've lost the page anyway, regarding Botswana, there was a big withdrawal from the government pension fund.\n\n---\n\nYes. That's right, yes.\n\n---\n\nHowever, you spoke of huge inflows as well. Now are the inflows from the same client? Or from another client?\n\n---\n\nThat one was institutional. The outflows were -- was an institutional outflow. The pension fund, as I understand it, wanted to change the philosophy and internationalize some -- international -- put some money outside of the their territory. The retail flows is largely what we've got on the business. And so not the same as the -- there's not a set-off. It's retail flows and institutional outflows.\n\n---\n\nIan Cruickshanks. You confirmed that you had lost ZAR 10 billion of PIC funds last year.\n\n---\n\nLast year. There's even a notice.\n\n---\n\nAnd there's another ZAR 10 billion going out this year. Is this going to be an ongoing process?\n\n---\n\nWe don't know.\n\n---\n\nI mean, how much of [indiscernible]. I'll just ask a question first, please. Sorry. And so that was the first part. And secondly, what this a performance-based against a benchmark? This -- or was it a decision? Or was it PIC deciding they wanted to take it in-house?\n\n---\n\nOkay. We do still have some money with the PIC, which -- on the industrial fund. So we think that we should be in a reasonable position there. They've done a review, so we stay on that one. I think the explanation provided is a bit of both. It's a bit of performance, which we can explain why, but they perhaps take a different view on performance. And also, they wanted to manage more stuff themselves and they want to maybe reallocate some money to other asset management operations. So I think it's a combination.\n\n---\n\nDo you see this as a growing trend in that institutional field?\n\n---\n\nIt's something we need to watch, Ian. We have to keep an eye on it, there's no doubt. I mean, this has been important flows for us over the years. I don't think it's something that's unique to Sanlam, but we need to watch it. We need to adjust, we need to adapt a little bit. That's the environment in which we're operating in there.\n\n---\n\nIt's Risto here. The new Chief Actuary's got away very light so far, so let me think of one. The 30 basis points increased your illiquidity premium on guaranteed plans. I mean, what's your justification for that?\n\n---\n\nWhich illiquidity premium are you talking about there?\n\n---\n\nFor the guaranteed plans. Because you changed the inflation annuity for the illiquidity premium in the last year, but I see you now changed the guaranteed plan.\n\n---\n\nBasically, we've build up some reserves from corporate credit over time. And we've released those reserves into the guaranteed plan reserves and we're releasing that over time. And that amount, amounts to 30 basis points, yes. So it's basically historical accumulation of profit that is released over the balance of the book.\n\n---\n\nI'm Mike Christelis. Just on the Sanlam Sky business. I mean, I wonder if you can talk a little bit about your thoughts around your potential or your ability to grow the new business volume line in the medium term. I mean, you've got one competitor whose already sort of taking action on price, you had another competitor claiming to want to get 20% higher market share than they currently have in that space, plus, you've got the economic or consumer sort of headwinds in that space. I mean, what sort of growth numbers do you think we could look at in the entry-level market in South Africa? Firstly sector-wide and then in your business?\n\n---\n\nI think there are 2 opportunities. I agree with you, Michael. It's a competitive space, and people have seen the opportunities there. They've seen the margins, we're aware of that. Anne and the team understand that. I think what we've got in our favor is that geographically, there are certain areas we're not as strong in as we could be. And that we know where we are a little bit light. And there's other reasons for that in the past, and we're addressing that, so that will help us a little bit. We've got to lift our geographic presence. But the most important opportunity is around the product set. As you've indicated, we're largely a funeral house. We need to develop a broader range of products for that market. The savings plans we think we can do now, they're lower margin, yes, but there's still an opportunity. And on the marginal cost basis, we can show a positive return. And then there's the issue of credit, as to how we're going to go about that. It may be something that we don't have an appetite for, but we can partner with someone who does. And there's the footprint, and then there's the technology. So I think -- I mean, I'm giving you the answers as -- I'm not giving you hard numbers. I mean, I don't think I can give you hard numbers. But we've got to stay the course there. We think we've got a few things that are in our favor. We're not the market leader, but we're a very solid second. We've got the people, we've got the focus, and, yes, we think we can do a bit more there.\n\n---\n\nIs there a prospect of a price war in that market? Or is [indiscernible], yes, takes it out of the way?\n\n---\n\nNo. I don't think a price war. I mean Anne, I don't see you -- I see you nodding your head. I don't see a price war there. I think there's been some good mortality. We've had to react to that. There's been good mortality experience for the reasons that you understand, that the improvements in health care, and the impact of the antiretrovirals. We have to reflect that in our pricing. But I don't see a price war. I think the market leader there, I take it, will act responsibly, as market leaders should.\n\n---\n\nYou mentioned that you had ZAR 2 billion, just over ZAR 2 billion you marked for acquisitions. Which areas in particular are you looking at? And how do you intend to execute? Is there a team that's dedicated to assessing acquisitions? Lastly -- and at today's exchange rates, it's less than $200 million, it's not very big. How does that impact your plans?\n\n---\n\nOkay. If I can go from the back, forward. Yes, I mean, you're right, it buys less. But the times that we're in, prices do tend to drop, sellers' expectations become more realistic, the pressure comes on and you've got more forced sellers. So one counterbalances the other, but your comment is well made. But the countries in which you are buying are also depreciating. So yes, it's less in dollar terms, but you can -- it's still an opportunity. At the end of the day, we either make the hurdle on the investment or we don't do it. We're either confident of that, or we don't do it. Okay. Yes, we have an M&A team, they are focused. They know how to go about this. They know what territories they want to be in. They know -- they had been around enough now. They know who the good players are and who the bad players are, are the ones to keep away from. And that's a skill that gets developed over time. It doesn't come automatically, you can't just shovel a thing to the investment banks. And your first question was where we're going to do it. Well, we're going to do it in the areas of our strategy, which is our Rest of Africa into India and Southeast Asia. Our priority, if I was to pick a priority on those, I would say Africa to sort of complete and implement the pan-African strategy. But if opportunities come up, like in India, which give us a better return, like the exercise in the options that I referred to, and we get a better return, and we'll do that. And it's all about where's the best return and discipline around that. And we're now in a nice position. Kobus, I think you -- Kobus would say that we've got competing requirements. We didn't always have that. Now we've got competing. So the better opportunity will get the investment money as opposed to the one that is not as good. I don't know if you want to add to that.\n\n---\n\nYes, that's been the case.\n\n---\n\nSo the capital discipline is fundamental. Of course, it's about assumptions into the future. And you're always at the vagaries of that. But I think our people -- and we know how to do it now. And as I said, that's doing the transaction. Once you've got the transaction done and you've got the business under your belt, we're getting better at implementing and getting the value out a little bit earlier. And that's also a skill that gets built up. But I make the point, there's 40 business in there. In time, it will be more. It just -- you got to keep your eyes on a lot of things.  \r\nOkay.\n\n---\n\nWe have a question from the webcast, WJ De Vries from Avior Capital Markets asks: How much has been provided following bad loans in the Shriram finance business? Will we be seeing further write-downs should infrastructure projects in India not pick up? And what type of collateral are there on these loans?\n\n---\n\nKobus, maybe?\n\n---\n\nYes. As I've mentioned, what we've provided for is ZAR 45 million for the 6 months. Obviously, the -- I think the -- one of the big problems there is just they're delaying the rollout of some of those projects. So I think that, at the moment, is the biggest concern, is the cash flow of those individual clients. And we'll have to judge that over time. I mean, obviously, you have the equipment that you can actually take back over time if it's necessary. We didn't -- Shriram does not do it at the moment because they still believe that the projects will go ahead and the people will actually be able to, in time, pay back their loans. But I think we're in a bit of an uncertain time at the moment in exactly how long that will take before we get an improvement in the situation. So yes, we've provided ZAR 45 million, and we'll have to watch what happens in the next 6 months. There are certain accounting requirements that now deal with those debts, I mean, it's the reality of, actually, the -- your ability to recover it over time.\n\n---\n\nAre there any further questions from the webcast? From the tele-con? Okay. And from the floor? Okay. \r\nIt just remains for me to thank you very much for coming down. Thanks for your support and your interest in the group, and we look forward to having further engagement with you. Some of the analysts, I'll see probably later in this year, and then again in the end of -- the beginning of March. So thanks very much, indeed. Thank you.\n\n---\n\nThank you.\n\n---\n\nThank you.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\nCan you give us some color on the whole Medscheme deal, is this an outsourcing efficiency thing? Are there other business to be derived from this deal with Medscheme/AfroCentric?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ian Kirk (Executives)】\nOkay. Looking at it from our side first, there's a base of clients there where there's not a lot of overlap with what we've got, okay? So we have certain products that we can market into that base over a period of time, and that's additional for us. And there's also the opportunity with the data, that we can use their data with our data to come with more appropriate life insurance pricing into the future and then sort of using the health care information that we've got, the managed care processes in our life insurance business as well. We won't be the first to do that, but I think we can certainly push ahead there and make our Life business a bit more efficient. Also, from the distribution perspective, we'll be able to give that a more credible health care offering to our distribution force. So that's what we see from our side, those 3 things. From the Medscheme side, they also didn't have the distribution capability, that was the one thing that they were missing. They were good on the administration on the managed care. They weren't so great on getting the organic growth, and that was really the opportunity. So for them, we bring them the distribution and the solid backing. And there's been some early wins there, where our participation, our future participation, they've been able to use their advantage in getting some new closed schemes. So we see -- it'll take time, but we see a nice opportunity there. Remember, we were very light in health care. It was the one area within our strategy in South Africa that we were very light, so it's a nice opportunity.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\nAnd maybe credentials there, Ian?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ian Kirk (Executives)】\nYes. Well, they're strong on their side. So they've been controlled by black empowerment. The listed company is black-controlled. That certainly helps them in their marketing. But our position doesn't really add to them there, to be honest with you. They're already at the levels they want...\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\nAnd there's been all [ph], from our own your point of view, in terms of BEE credentials?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ian Kirk (Executives)】\nNo, not from them through to us, we're fine on the ownership side as well. No.\r\nKobus, I don't know if you've got...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kobus Möller (Executives)】\n[indiscernible]\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\nMr. Kirk, I'm referring to the fund income statement on pages 30 and 31 of the annexures. I have some questions and comments. May I start with the line item investment surpluses and ask why under Sanlam Personal Finance, there has been such a massive swing from ZAR 997 million positive to ZAR 429 million negative, and that this has taken through to corporate column but with the brackets reversed.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kobus Möller (Executives)】\nThose are essentially just intercompany, that's why we actually reverse it on consolidation again. So it's purely intercompany movements of funds and returns. So it's actually -- that's why on a net group basis, it's a net 0. So I think it's an accounting entry more than anything else.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\nI'm still puzzled as to why it suddenly, out of nowhere, as it were, it appears from -- as a massive turnaround from 1 year to the next. Was a decision taken to restructure in some way?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kobus Möller (Executives)】\nNo. I think it'll be the underlying movement of certain investments, we -- movements in the equity markets change or Sanlam and Santam investment may have increased last year, and it's down this year. And as our -- intergroup, such movements, really, that we actually just conquer [ph] out on a group level. It's essentially due to the market movement.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\nOkay. Then I'd like to refer to the column Sanlam Emerging Markets. Mention has already been made of, and I quote, \"Headwinds in both Zambia and India, amongst other Emerging Markets.\" However, when I look at the first line item, financial services income, I see an increase in business of approximately 20%.

But the times that we're in, prices do tend to drop, sellers' expectations become more realistic, the pressure comes on and you've got more forced sellers. So one counterbalances the other, but your comment is well made. But the countries in which you are buying are also depreciating. So yes, it's less in dollar terms, but you can -- it's still an opportunity. At the end of the day, we either make the hurdle on the investment or we don't do it. We're either confident of that, or we don't do it. Okay. Yes, we have an M&A team, they are focused. They know how to go about this. They know what territories they want to be in. They know -- they had been around enough now. They know who the good players are and who the bad players are, are the ones to keep away from. And that's a skill that gets developed over time. It doesn't come automatically, you can't just shovel a thing to the investment banks. And your first question was where we're going to do it. Well, we're going to do it in the areas of our strategy, which is our Rest of Africa into India and Southeast Asia. Our priority, if I was to pick a priority on those, I would say Africa to sort of complete and implement the pan-African strategy. But if opportunities come up, like in India, which give us a better return, like the exercise in the options that I referred to, and we get a better return, and we'll do that. And it's all about where's the best return and discipline around that. And we're now in a nice position. Kobus, I think you -- Kobus would say that we've got competing requirements. We didn't always have that. Now we've got competing. So the better opportunity will get the investment money as opposed to the one that is not as good. I don't know if you want to add to that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kobus Möller (Executives)】\nYes, that's been the case.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ian Kirk (Executives)】\nSo the capital discipline is fundamental. Of course, it's about assumptions into the future. And you're always at the vagaries of that. But I think our people -- and we know how to do it now. And as I said, that's doing the transaction. Once you've got the transaction done and you've got the business under your belt, we're getting better at implementing and getting the value out a little bit earlier. And that's also a skill that gets built up. But I make the point, there's 40 business in there. In time, it will be more. It just -- you got to keep your eyes on a lot of things.  \r\nOkay.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nWe have a question from the webcast, WJ De Vries from Avior Capital Markets asks: How much has been provided following bad loans in the Shriram finance business? Will we be seeing further write-downs should infrastructure projects in India not pick up? And what type of collateral are there on these loans?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ian Kirk (Executives)】\nKobus, maybe?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kobus Möller (Executives)】\nYes. As I've mentioned, what we've provided for is ZAR 45 million for the 6 months. Obviously, the -- I think the -- one of the big problems there is just they're delaying the rollout of some of those projects. So I think that, at the moment, is the biggest concern, is the cash flow of those individual clients. And we'll have to judge that over time. I mean, obviously, you have the equipment that you can actually take back over time if it's necessary. We didn't -- Shriram does not do it at the moment because they still believe that the projects will go ahead and the people will actually be able to, in time, pay back their loans. But I think we're in a bit of an uncertain time at the moment in exactly how long that will take before we get an improvement in the situation. So yes, we've provided ZAR 45 million, and we'll have to watch what happens in the next 6 months. There are certain accounting requirements that now deal with those debts, I mean, it's the reality of, actually, the -- your ability to recover it over time.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ian Kirk (Executives)】\nAre there any further questions from the webcast? From the tele-con? Okay. And from the floor? Okay. \r\nIt just remains for me to thank you very much for coming down. Thanks for your support and your interest in the group, and we look forward to having further engagement with you. Some of the analysts, I'll see probably later in this year, and then again in the end of -- the beginning of March. So thanks very much, indeed. Thank you.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kobus Möller (Executives)】\nThank you.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Anton Gildenhuys (Executives)】\nThank you.",

      "transcript_text1": "Okay. Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. I will briefly go over sales and store growth highlights for the second quarter before turning it over to Michael who will provide you with more detailed update on our financial results and key operating initiatives.\r\nThe results being reported this quarter reflect the exceptional performance of our business as all key financial and operating metrics were met or exceeded. This performance is a direct consequence of our attention to details, rigorous cost controls and the successful execution of our merchandising strategy. In this quarter, our sales increased by 14.1% as a result of strong organic sales growth, driven by high comparable store sales. Sales were also driven by the continued expansion of our store network. In this quarter, we achieved a 7.9% increase in same-store sales through an increase in the average basket size and an increase in the number of transactions. We continue to attract new and existing customers to our broad assortment of merchandise offered at exceptional value. Sales growth is consistent across all regions of the country, which testifies to the consistent shopping experience in all our stores. \r\nDuring the quarter, we opened 17 net new stores compared to 18 net new stores opened in Q2 last year. Our total store count across Canada is now 989 stores compared to 917 stores as at August 3, 2014. We can expect to hit a new milestone soon as we reach 1,000 stores in the upcoming quarter. So far this year, we have opened 34 net new stores and we still expect to open 70 to 80 net new stores in fiscal 2016. \r\nEBITDA grew 35.3% this quarter, which is attributable to strong sales and margins, general and administrative costs that benefited from the scaling impact of our sales and continued focus on operational efficiencies. On the purchasing side, before you ask the question, I can tell you that we have not been adversely impacted by the recent developments reported in the news about China and its economy. It's business as usual on that front. From a merchandising point of view, summer sales were very strong as customers and consumers responded well to our line of gardening and summer products. The careful execution of our merchandising strategy and the implementation of operational improvements have made us stronger as we grow. We continue to reach new customers in an efficient manner, all the while providing a consistent shopping experience in all our stores. \r\nWith that, I will turn this call over to Michael.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Larry, and good morning, everyone. So during the second quarter, we increased our sales by 14.1% to $653.3 million from $572.6 million in the prior year. The increase in sale was fueled by the opening of 72 net new stores over the past 12 months and a same-store sales increase of 7.9% during the quarter. The same-store sales growth consisted of a 6.2% increase in basket size, which reflect the consumer demand for higher price point items and a 1.5% increase in the number of transactions driven by higher traffic in our stores. \r\nIn this quarter, 76% of our sales originated from products priced higher than $1 compared to 67% in the corresponding quarter last year. Debit card penetration also increased as 46% of sales were paid with credit -- debit cards, sorry, compared to 43% in the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year.\r\nIn the second quarter, our gross margin was 38.4% of sales compared to 36% of sales in Q2 last year. Our higher-than-expected gross margin this quarter was driven by the positive scaling impact of the stronger-than-anticipated same-store sales growth and the higher product margins in anticipation of an increase in the average forward exchange contract rate. In other words, we made select changes to our product offering and price mix while we are still hedged at favorable rates in anticipation of the next year's currency headwind when those hedges roll out. The increased gross margin is also attributable to lower logistics and transportation costs as a percentage of sales, as a result of operational improvements as well as reductions in rates and fuel surcharges. \r\nAs a result of these factors, we've revised our fiscal 2016 gross margin target range from 36% to 37% to 37% to 38% for the full year. However, beyond fiscal 2016, the gross margin should fall back within the 36% to 37% range as we factor in the headwinds related to the weakening Canadian dollar. As we have stated in the past, we actively manage our gross margin by continually reinvesting in the value proposition offered to consumers and by refreshing up to 30% of our product offering on a yearly basis. In the longer term, the goal remains to target a margin that will sustain reasonable profitability while ensuring that our customers are getting the value proposition expected to stimulate continued sales growth. \r\nOur Q2 G&A as a percentage of sale was 15.9% compared to 17.1% last year. This progression is a result of continued improvements in labor productivity achieved through initiatives implemented at the store level as well as the positive scaling effect of higher sales on fixed costs. Overall, we still expect an improvement in the G&A margin for the full fiscal 2016 year compared to fiscal 2015 as we continue to target a margin between 16.5% and 17% for fiscal 2016. \r\nWith higher sales and margins and lower G&A costs, our EBITDA in Q2 grew 35.3% to $150 -- to $146.9 million or 22.5% of sales. Q2 net earnings increased to $95.5 million or $0.74 per diluted share compared to $68.9 million or $0.51 per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal 2015. \r\nCash flows from operations increased to $124.8 million in Q2 from $106.9 million in the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal year. This increase is due to the higher earnings during the current quarter. We spent $21.5 million on capital expenditures in Q2 compared to $17.1 million last year. These expenditures relate primarily to the new store openings as well as investments in information technology. In fiscal 2016, we still expect to incur capital expenditures in the range of $95 million to $100 million depending on the number of new stores that we open. \r\nOn June 10, 2015, we announced the renewal of our normal course issuer bid. The 2015-2016 NCIB program will allow us to purchase for cancellation up to 3.5% of issued and outstanding shares at June 9, 2015, or up to 4.5 million shares over the 12-month period from June 17, 2015, to June 16, 2016. \r\nIn Q2 F '16, we repurchased for cancellation under the 2014 and '15 NCIB program and under the 2015 and 2016 NCIB program, a total of 1,531,154 shares at an average cost of $72.82 per share, for a total cash consideration of $111.5 million. From an operational perspective, we have made significant investments in stores over the past few years to continuously improve our operational efficiencies, and we are seeing the results in our G&A margin that has steadily improved over the years. Investments in advanced labor scheduling tool have provided better control of our labor time and attendance and the allocation of labor hours at the stores, which has positively contributed to the productivity increases we've seen. Also, the continuous improvement of replenishment models have -- has allowed better in-stock inventory positions, and we believe this has a positive impact on sales. These investments are part of the initiatives that provide ongoing benefits to our operations. Additional productivity investment in fiscal 2016 include the rollout of WiFi that has just been successfully completed. In terms of hardware rollout, all of these initiatives have laid down the foundations for mobile technology that is currently being piloted. These initiatives are intended to reduce nonvalue-added tasks at the store level, optimize inventory levels in the store and reduce wait times at the cash registers. We expect to start seeing the benefits of these new operational efficiencies by the end of next year in fiscal 2017. \r\nOverall, we are very pleased with the financial and operating performance of the company this quarter and the continued progress being made on our key initiatives. \r\nSo this ends our formal remarks and we can now take questions. So operator, I'll turn the call over to you.",

So operator, I'll turn the call over to you.",
      "transcript_text3": "You said that in anticipation of the changing FX rates, you made some changes to your merchandising programs. Can you tell us exactly the kinds of changes that you made?\n\n---\n\nWell, not exactly. That would take too long. But in the process of that, Perry, is that, as you know, we hedge out anywhere between 6 months to a year so that the buyers, when they commit, know at what currency they are committing to. But knowing that the currency continues to increase and that eventually, your hedge cost, if the currencies stabilize, finishes by reaching the level of the currency that we see today, the spot rate. So in anticipation of that, you don't want to modify your prices every 6 months, so you set the price point and the return in considering that future cost that's going to be a factor in determining the return. So that's basically it.\n\n---\n\nAnd did you make these changes before the quarter or during the quarter?\n\n---\n\nDuring the quarter.\n\n---\n\nNo. Well it's done before. The commitments are made before. You receive the goods afterwards and when you start receiving and you start selling them. But because you paid them at a hedged rate, which is lower than the spot that's coming up or the hedge rate that we will have in the future, you already have that activity going on.\n\n---\n\nAnd do you expect to do more of this in the next couple of months?\n\n---\n\nYes. As you all know, we have that visibility and that's how we look at it.\n\n---\n\nBut it will come to an end.\n\n---\n\nBut it comes to an end. I mean, it's a timing. Because of the sharp increase -- you haven't seen that in the past because you didn't have any sharp increase. So it just melted in. Whereas now, you had a sharp increase in the currency. And so you forecast that and you take it into account when you determine the mix and the return on your products.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And on a slightly different topic, the 6.2% increase in transaction size, was that mostly higher-priced items in the basket? Or were there more items in the basket?\n\n---\n\nYes. We don't disclose the content of the basket. But obviously, the price has -- the higher price point penetration has an impact.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And my last question. I'm just wondering how you're offsetting the minimum wage increases this year and how concerned are you about minimum wage increases over the next year or so?\n\n---\n\nWe're -- I mean, the biggest impact was last year with the Ontario increase. Now it's lower, so we're not -- we don't have major concerns as to the -- any major increase. Well, this year, we know it, and next year, we don't anticipate major increase.\n\n---\n\nSorry to continue to beat this horse, but I just want to make sure that I'm understanding what you're saying. So you don't want to keep raising or adjusting your price points. So let's just say there's a certain gardening tool that you have the benefit of buying with the currency hedged at a higher price. You introduced it this summer at $2, but you know that looking out, it would have to be at $2.20 or $2.50 in order to protect your margins. So you just introduce it at $2.50 so that it will be the same price. Is that kind of what we're talking about here?\n\n---\n\nIt's -- I mean, yes, it's not necessarily a markup. It's -- we refresh 25% to 30% of the items. So it could be new items coming in. And where you say exactly, the logic is there. I mean, you're right. So you know that the cost of the currency is going to go up 3 months later because you hedge out, but the spreads get tighter and tighter or higher and higher as you move out. So you know that, eventually, you're going to catch up to the 1 25 or whatever level it is. But it's higher than the hedged rate. So in anticipation of that, obviously, you take that into account and you factor it into your price point and the item that you're presenting.\n\n---\n\nYes. Let me give -- get another -- give you another crack at that question. Let's say at one point, the spot was 1 25 and you're hedged at 1 08, well, the buyers are looking at, certainly I am, are looking more at the 1 25 than the 1 08. So we're costing at -- whether it's a new item or an old item. We're costing at that 1 25. We're -- so our retail prices indicate that margin of costing, yet our spot is at 1 08 or 1 10 or at 1 12. So that difference is creating that difference in the margins.\n\n---\n\nThat's very helpful, Larry. So just continuing on with the subject of FX. On the last call, you said that at this point in time, there are no plans to introduce higher price points but that if the dollar continues to weaken, that could be something that you would look at in future. Could you update us on your current thinking?\n\n---\n\nNow Irene, who said that? Okay, I did. You're right, you're right. Okay. So basically, we'll do nothing, like I said, for FY '16, nor would we do anything for Q1 and Q2. Now for Q3 and Q4, I think we'll get a better indication from our trip to the Orient in October. And the new price points, if indeed we decide to go that way, would be $3.50 and $4. But we will at all times maintain, and that's important to note, a maximum price point on foodstuffs at $2. So foodstuffs will continue as they have to maintain the $2 price point. Now what are we going to find out in the Orient? Well, we'll probably find that prices, generally speaking, are stable. I don't think we may get the occasional discount for that devaluation of the renminbi, but not always because they've hedged out and they claim that they can't give us that 2%. Now 2% is meaningless compared to the 30% we've lost in the Canadian dollar, and we should remember that more than anything else. So what are we going to see in the Orient? Well, we're certainly not going to be able to solve the Canadian dollar versus the American dollar decrease or the weakening of the Canadian dollar. But in different areas, we may have to treat the retail prices in different ways. That we may see. But the probability is in Q3 and Q4 of next year, we'll have to move our price points up. That would be the probability. But I think the clarity we're going to see when we make our trip in October will give us a little bit more, well, confidence as to the fact that we're doing the right thing. We'd be doing the right thing. I just don't like -- in general, we like to maintain our prices as long as we can, but this is really an exceptional time where the Canadian dollar has gone so poorly against the U.S. dollar and everything is bought in U.S. dollars. So we -- to absorb 25% to 35% is almost impossible. So go ahead, Irene.\n\n---\n\nI was going to say that's extremely helpful, Larry.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Anything else?\n\n---\n\nJust one last question, if I may, which goes to performance across the country. Are you seeing any weakness at all in the oil-producing regions, even in micro markets like Fort McMurray?\n\n---\n\nWell, we're not going to open a store in Fort McMurray, and we are not seeing -- I could get a better rental rate there than I did about 1 year or 2 ago. Having said that, we don't have any plans to go to Fort McMurray. But that was an example you're using. We're not seeing what -- to answer your question, we're not seeing any of that as far as our sales go. So I think our sales are pretty consistent across the country.\n\n---\n\nYes, that's the case.\n\n---\n\nI mean, where we have more mature -- even where we have more mature markets like Ontario and Québec, we're seeing some nice increases in both those markets. So it's pretty steady across the country.\n\n---\n\nMichael, you have raised your in-year gross margin guidance higher, but I noticed you're maintaining your line of the 16.5% to 17% on G&A. Could you give us some indication or just discuss what it is that sort of keeps your cautious guide on G&A despite the traction of these initiatives? You've highlighted there's not any major wage inflation expected down the pipe. Certainly, a lot of the initiatives appear to be tracking very well. Could you sort of walk us through sort of how and why that line is being held?\n\n---\n\nYes, well, I mean, generally...\n\n---\n\nWe would say very poorly.\n\n---\n\nYes. The reason is, as we get into Q3, Q4, we're against bigger same-store sales. Last year, Q3 was 5.9 and Q4, 8.5, in terms of scaling. And I think the range is large enough that we're still comfortable with what we gave out last quarter and it just hasn't changed. So I mean, it's -- those are the, principally, the elements that we look at when we give out the guidance.\n\n---\n\nFair enough. And just one other quick question. Just in terms of the competitive intensity and specifically Western Canada, have you noticed any change with perhaps a competitor of yours being -- competitor or 2 of yours being a little distracted or otherwise? And could you sort of just speak to the Western Canadian competitive intensity more broadly?\n\n---\n\nWell, I -- out west, they're certainly -- if you're talking about Dollar Tree, they certainly are there. I'm not counting the number of stores they're opening or closing. There is more competition out west with Dollar Tree being there. They have about 200 stores and they're all from Ontario West. But our numbers show that across the country they're about the same. So...\n\n---\n\nYes. I think you're right, Larry.\n\n---\n\nI don't know what to add besides that.\n\n---\n\nThere is no -- I mean, the -- if we look at -- what we do is from coast-to-coast in every province or region, we have reports on how the stores do compared to the chain and compared to the previous years. And there's no real movement going on, whether it's BC, Alberta, Newfoundland, Québec, Ontario. So it's pretty steady across. The competitive landscape is a bit different out west. That's where you have, for instance, most of the dollar store chains, the other 4 dollar store chains, including Dollar Tree. But in essence, there's not more going out -- going on out west than there is out east.\n\n---\n\nBut Kenric, if I were Dollar Tree and I just took over 8,000 stores in the states, I would be distracted, I can say that. I would be, but maybe they're not, but I would be. It's quite a challenge.\n\n---\n\nSo sorry to stay with the same issues, but it's obviously what we're all focused on. So I understand what you've done in terms of moving price up to keep it simple for the consumer and maybe gaining some gross margin temporarily in advance. When you look into the next year and the first half of the year, are you concerned that you'll just, by natural progression of COGS, see gross margin deteriorate and that's why you're maintaining your guidance for next year? Or is the 36% to 37% -- yes.\n\n---\n\nYes. Absolutely. I mean, it's as simple as that.\n\n---\n\nYes, you hit it on the nail.\n\n---\n\nOne of the factors that's going to kick in, in F '17 is the increased cost of the currency. And that's going to impact my margin down and back into the 36% to 37% range.\n\n---\n\nHow much proactivity have you been able to apply to changing the actual nature of the product as a way of containing the cost of goods sold inflation? Has that been a real focus for you? Or has it been more just trying to figure out what items you can take price up on?\n\n---\n\nWell, I think nothing has changed. In other words, we continue to replenish 25% to 30% of our items year-round. And the example Larry gave is dead-on accurate. So you tell the buyer, \"Here's the short-term hedge rate,\" when we're actually going to pay. But here's the 3, 6 months later hedge rate, if we are hedged, or the spot if we're not, and that's what we'll have to deal with. So do we increase it once now and back 3 months later? I don't think so. So the buyer just takes into account the 1 25 in the example that Larry gave out earlier instead of the 1 08. And the buyers just buy and select with that in mind, with that factor in mind. That's all. Nothing in the process or in the flow changes. It's just the discussion as to the timing of the currency and what currency you take.\n\n---\n\nYes. So Michael, I think it's a combination of both. You said it. It's a combination of where you can change packaging. I mean, if you have a food container, it's one food container. You can't make a half a food container. You can make it smaller, but if you want to have that size food container, you have to make a decision whether to make your markup on it or not. Where -- if you have a package of 20 pencils and you decide to go to 15, well, that's another decision. And that's been going on for a long time. It could have gone from 10 to 20 when the dollar was going the other way. So we're always playing with that dynamic. And depending where the dollar -- it's a lot more uncomfortable going the way the dollar's been going, obviously. We like to give better value. But the value is relative to the rest of the country, and the rest of the country has to do the same thing, all the rest of the retailers. So as a consumer, I guess next year will not be a pleasant year from a purchasing point of view because you'll probably be seeing some inflation in all likelihood or getting 15 pencils instead of 20. But that's life. I mean, people understand or should understand that if you lose 1/3 of your value of your -- or the value of your currency, well, if you travel to Florida, you have the same problem. So we're dealing with that on a daily basis. It's a struggle. You want to give value yet you have this squeeze on margins, which you guys are going to keep us to. So we're doing the best we can.\n\n---\n\nBut again, we're all on the same level playing field, and it's been the model forever. And as long as your relative value to competition is better, that's what we're working towards.\n\n---\n\nYes. On the cost savings side, like a lot of talk about in-store initiatives. But I'm wondering about the distribution center. Like, are there chunky opportunities still on the DC? I mean, obviously, your revenue growth is providing a fair amount of leverage there. But is there cost reduction initiatives, further automation or other initiatives that we should be thinking about as you look into 2017 and beyond?\n\n---\n\nYes. We -- and we have some going on now and have for the past year and which have contributed to the -- also to the reduction or the improvement of the margin this quarter, which can be palette optimization, delivery consolidation and things of that nature.\n\n---\n\nAnd to those -- from a dollar standpoint, though, do those pale in comparison to what we're seeing from a labor scheduling standpoint and what you think you'll get out of the WiFi deployment?\n\n---\n\nNo. I think it's a slower and a smaller impact.\n\n---\n\nYes. I -- we agree with you, Jim.\n\n---\n\nAnd new DC in Western Canada is still several years off if you continue to squeeze more productivity out of the existing facility?\n\n---\n\nYes, yes. Again, that warehouse in DC out west depends on if it makes economic sense. In fact, with oil at its present rate or costs, it makes less sense every day. So if we're going to need, which will probably happen shortly, more space to run this business, whether it's DC or warehousing, we'll probably do it out east because that's what makes sense today by a long shot. It's -- and we have better controls by having it in Montreal, around us, and it's a whole other thing to go -- to have another warehouse out west. And if it makes huge economic sense, we'll do it, but it doesn't make any economic sense at the moment.\n\n---\n\nI just had a question about the -- there was an acceleration in the proportion of products that are priced at $1 or more. And I'm just wondering what the underlying dynamics of that are. Are you continuing to increase the mix of SKUs that are priced higher than $1? Or are just people buying more of existing higher-priced SKUs? Or just give some flavor on what's going on there because you did have quite a leap in that...\n\n---\n\nI think it happens by default. When you're out buying today, and we're not talking 20 years ago, we're talking today, you're being offered less and less items that could sell for $1 to $1.25. So the tendency is for the buyers -- and you know subconsciously or consciously that you're being offered nicer products to sell for $2 and $3 and whatever. And you are going to, as a buyer, tend to move in that direction just -- not by design, but just out of human nature by saying -- and you're not being offered. And the stuff you're being offered at -- to sell for $1 to $1.25 is certainly not the value that you used to get 20 years ago. So almost by default, it's not by design. We're not saying we want to sell more product at the higher price points. My God, I say higher, relative to other retailers. Okay, we'll say higher. So I think it's just when you're out there selecting and being presented, whether you are there or here, you're always getting new items being offered, the likelihood for the buyer is to buy something that is nicer and more -- therefore more expensive, and therefore will increase your variety at the higher price points. To sell something at $1 today and $1.25, you've got to pay between $0.25 and $0.35. Well, China is not concentrating on that price level anymore. They're not concentrating like they used to 20 years ago. I mean, there was a huge concentration of effort and new molds and just items being created for that price point. That price point seems to, other than Dollar Tree in the states, have gone -- has gone away to a large extent. It's gone bye-bye. So I don't think we are by consciously saying we want to buy more items at $2.50 and $3, we just do. And I think that's the best answer unless someone around the table has a better answer. No. That's all you're getting for today on that one.\n\n---\n\nNo, that was a good explanation, Larry. Just is there any update on Dollar City? Or is it just kind of steady as she goes?\n\n---\n\nSteady as she goes.\n\n---\n\nYes. We're happy with the progress.\n\n---\n\nCan you just give us an update on some of your new cost initiatives like WiFi, for example, where are you guys at on that?\n\n---\n\nEssentially, we've got the antennas and the hardware set up. There's still connections to do, programming to do and a lot of training to do. So that's why we only expect the benefits to kick in next year in the latter part. But everything is going on track, on budget and it's going very well.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Great. And I think I asked you guys this on the last call, but just given the slowdown that we have seen in China, are you guys seeing any more sort of weakness in actual cost in China? I mean, obviously, the currency is going to offset a portion of that, but have we seen any other cost relent?\n\n---\n\nNo. Again, it goes by your product category. But the answer is no. Just to maintain prices, what they're -- I mean, they're still dealing with the increases in labor costs. And all of a sudden, they say -- when you say, well, when oil is going up, they say, well, we have to increase the price of our plastics. But when that goes down, all of a sudden, oil is a small part of the product. So -- and how are you going to fight that? They are still the best source of supply. And I wish I could say that we're getting 10% decreases, but it's far from that. We're maintaining our costs or in certain categories, getting a bit of a break, but that break would be 2%, 3%. 5% at most. So generally speaking, it's business as usual in the sense that we're not getting price decreases, not nearly enough to compensate what's happening with our Canadian dollar here. Not in the same league.\n\n---\n\nYes. Okay. Understood. And just regionally, were any areas stronger in terms of same-store sales this quarter or traffic?\n\n---\n\nNo. Across the country, we're doing well across the country, thankfully. It's the same across the country.\n\n---\n\nJust one question to round it all out. Your average traffic counts per store, how are they looking? I mean, has -- have you seen changes with that? I guess it's another cute way of getting at your basket size.\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nYes. Well, yes. That sort of basket we don't disclose. And so traffic is, again, coast-to-coast and it's pretty stable. And yes, there's not much more we can say about that.\n\n---\n\nWe're happy. We're happy. We seem to be getting our share.\n\n---\n\nFair enough. That's great. And store sizes, are you still planning to look at similar-sized stores on average as you continue to roll through 70, 80 stores per year?\n\n---\n\nWell, haven't you heard that we've taken over 30 Target stores?\n\n---\n\nNo.\n\n---\n\nI'm just kidding you. I'm just kidding you. I'm just kidding. No, I think, still, 10,000 feet is ideal. It doesn't mean that if the opportunity presents itself, we won't go higher. And if the opportunity presents itself, we won't go down to, let's say, 6,000, 7,000 feet. It's more difficult to operate. But when you're in the middle of Toronto or the middle of Vancouver, we don't expect to be able to get 10,000-foot boxes that easily. So we usually take smaller-sized stores, which is okay. They usually have basements. So the operation is a little bit more costly, but it's okay. I don't know if I've answered your question.\n\n---\n\nYes. It's all fine. I'm just wondering, last question. Could you remind me and all of us about where you're opening up stores over the coming 12 months, urban, suburban, rural, east, west, that kind of thing?\n\n---\n\nYes. It's -- there's no direction. In other words, we don't say like we've got to open some urban stores. It's just that we're -- again, it's opportunity-driven. It's opportunity-driven across the country. It seems that as things turn out, that we're still opening 2/3 of our stores in Québec and Ontario. As densified as we think they are, they're still -- that's where the people are. And when we bring our stores to the people, they seem to react positively. The other areas are very -- the Maritimes and Newfoundland out west, they're very good areas for us. But at the end of the day, it's still about 2/3 Québec and Canada -- Québec and Ontario.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Let me sneak one more in. Just given this is a bit of, I'll call it, a windfall year, argue against that if you will, but given your gross margin gains this year, temporary as they may be, but would that suggest to all of us that your buybacks will perhaps increase year-over-year?\n\n---\n\nThat's -- yes, I mean, the -- in terms of buyback, the approach is the same, opportunistic. And the intention, as it has been for the past programs, is to continue buying back shares.\n\n---\n\nI just wanted to jump back quickly to the gross margin and, as was said a few times before, I understand there's a transient benefit on product margin related to pricing. But in the disclosure materials, it says the increase was slightly higher product margin. So -- and your gross margin rate year-over-year was a pretty strong increase. So just wondering, how large were the other factors like the scaling and logistics and the transportation costs? Are those meaningful drivers of the benefit?\n\n---\n\nYes. And the importance, without even going into too much detail, it's the markup had the bigger impact and the transport had a good impact also. And then you've got scaling and other smaller factors.\n\n---\n\nGot it. So the transportation benefit, I should presumed that sticks and that's somewhat related to the price of oil?\n\n---\n\nI'm sorry, Vishal. I have problems hearing you.\n\n---\n\nSorry. Can you hear me better now?\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nOkay. The transportation benefit, presumably that sticks and it's related to the price of oil?\n\n---\n\nYes. A part yes. Yes?\n\n---\n\nOkay. And just lastly, on the Latin American expansion, just a quick reminder here. Is the business model to be designed to be similar to Dollarama in terms of economics? I know it's early days here, but I was just trying to understand.\n\n---\n\nYes. The business model, first, it's to replicate the Dollarama concept. So as we've always said, if we drop you in a store there, you'd think you're in a Dollarama store. And hopefully -- obviously, it's very small now, so you don't get the scaling benefits in terms of KPIs. But the intention is to make it an operation that has very strong margins over the long term.\n\n---\n\nOkay, yes. Don't forget where we have smaller stores there. We don't -- we can't find 10,000-foot stores in that area. So you're dealing with stores between 2,000 and 4,000, 5,000 feet. And your labor is less expensive, so you're able to supply those stores more regularly and spend more money on supply because I think you just don't see -- you don't have the size stores to put your assortment in. So the assortment has to be better managed and better managed physically, which they do. They do very well. They have done very well. And we've just opened a few more stores or our first stores in Guatemala as a second country in Central America, just for your interest, which you -- yes.\n\n---\n\nI just wanted to ask on your China purchases. Are they all made in U.S. dollars? Or do you have any contracts with suppliers in renminbi?\n\n---\n\nFor the moment, it's all in U.S. dollars, and we're evaluating renminbi.\n\n---\n\nAnd then I was wondering on the freight. Your buyers seem to be expert at the forward curve of currency, but I'm just wondering on freight, do you give them a freight factor to include in their gross margin that you provide them? Or how do they adjust...\n\n---\n\nYes. Well, the system provides for that. So it's -- we have landed, including freight and other factors.\n\n---\n\nYes. The freight advantages, and correct me if I'm wrong, Michael, the freight advantages are coming from domestic transportation, not from -- we haven't had a serious freight decrease.\n\n---\n\nNo. No, no, you're right. That's outbound transport where we need to chain [ph] the freight -- I guess you're talking about freight-in, Keith?\n\n---\n\nWell, I was wondering both freight-in and freight domestically, whether your -- that's part of your buyers' calculation.\n\n---\n\nYes. Absolutely.\n\n---\n\nSo do you give them the number that you're anticipating freight will be and they build that in? And then if freight's less that, that sort of is -- boosts their performance in their category?\n\n---\n\nYes. When we look at gross margin, the 36% to 37%, logistics is a component definitely. The currency, the freight-in, outbound transport, all of that is part of it. So if we anticipate that the gross margin is going to go up because of a better outbound transport and/or logistics, we let the buyers know so that they understand that it's going to improve the margin and they can certainly factor that in when they're buying.\n\n---\n\nWe don't sleep very well with all this information, I'll tell you.\n\n---\n\nYes. Well certainly, the numbers are working so far. And just on the Target stores, I know you were joking, but I ran into a story recently where the -- an old Zellers had been carved up in 4 pieces and you are 1 piece and there was a Winners and another piece. Are there many opportunities like that? Or are they very one-off-ish?\n\n---\n\nGod, I wish there were more. Those are the old Zellers. Those are the stores that were not taken by Target. The ones selected by Target were obviously the better locations, and location had nothing to do with their failing, in my opinion. So we do have some, some, old Zellers that were not taken by Target. Some of them have been, by the developer, have been cut up. Where were you looking at?\n\n---\n\nHuntsville.\n\n---\n\nYes, Huntsville. Okay. Yes, so we made that move. We didn't put a second store in Huntsville, we simply moved locations to what we thought was a better location, that one being in the Zellers. Some opportunities have come up like that, maybe 2, 3 of them. Some opportunities have come up with respect to carving up the former Targets also. And I think more will come about, but it doesn't mean an extra store, unfortunately. It probably means relocating one of our existing stores into what we feel would be a better location. It has happened. But when you have a 1,000 stores, you're looking at 3, 4 of them.\n\n---\n\nRight. And just finally, how does the back-to-school merchandise assortment look? And if you have any comments on the results there.\n\n---\n\nNeil, do you have anything to say on back-to-school in July, Neil?\n\n---\n\nNo. It was in line with last year. We were happy with the results.\n\n---\n\nJust 2 quick questions, if I can. First, when you talk about the introduction potentially of $3.50 and $4 price points, would you keep the same number of items? Like, if you have 7 price points right now, would you keep the same number of price points? Or would that be in addition to, do you think?\n\n---\n\nIt would be in addition to.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And the second question, I understand your gross margin is going to normalize back to the 36% to 37% range as the hedges kick in. But just to go one step further. If the dollar were to decline, going forward a couple of years, to $1.15, prices are now adjusted for current spot rates. Would you still target a 36% to 37% gross margin? Or would that be an opportunity to have the value proposition potentially be at a higher gross margin or in your example earlier, go to $0.17...\n\n---\n\nI would like that to happen and then we'll give some serious thought to it. I just can't speculate that way at this moment. In the past, we've given better value when the Canadian dollar was improving versus the U.S. dollar. We tended to give it. But to speculate what will happen if it became $1.15 and it's not $1.30 any longer, I don't know. Things happening in China. Where will China be? Where will oil, where will fuel be? To speculate that far out, I just don't -- I wouldn't like to do that.\n\n---\n\nBut again, Brian, we'll be all on the same level playing field as others. So I mean, it's always -- you're always comparing and managing it relative to others too.\n\n---\n\nYes. I guess the point is if you can throw up robust numbers at $1.30, you potentially have an opportunity at $1.15.\n\n---\n\nRight.\n\n---\n\nYou can conclude that. I would conclude that, if I were you. But I don't know how -- what things will be like when that happens and if that happens. And hopefully, that happens because it's a lot easier to manage $1.15 than $1.30 or $1.35.\n\n---\n\nIn other words, it's not an automatic gross margin benefit. You adjust to competition.\n\n---\n\nJust as you contemplate introducing new higher price points, will most of the additional SKUs be used to expand your -- the assortment of the existing categories? Or do you see it as an opportunity to perhaps get into new categories that you're presently not providing?\n\n---\n\nNo. I do not see it as a means of introducing new categories. It's just within the existing categories. We -- no. That is the answer. It's existing categories. Absolutely.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And I think it sounds like as you contemplate higher price points, it would suggest that your confidence in your ability to preserve the value proposition for the consumer at the higher price point will still be preserved. How do you kind of balance that against the risk that -- of that not being able to achieve -- analyzing the value proposition with the customers as you go...\n\n---\n\nI think we -- at the higher price points, we hope we can give the same value that we give at every other price point. And we're going to make sure we do that. I can only say that much for that question. I think at $3.50 and $4, we'll be able to give value, the same values as we gave in every other single -- every other price point. And again, we're competing on the same playing field as everybody else in Canada. So that should be the case.\n\n---\n\nGot you. Okay. And my last question is when you look at your same-store sales growth performance, if you look at, say, the bottom 25% of your stores, how is the comp store sales growth relative to your company average? I just want to get a sense of what the variance is between your worst-performing stores versus the company average.\n\n---\n\nNo, we don't go into that detail, Chris. But essentially, as we said in the past, they all contribute and it's pretty much all well bunched up.\n\n---\n\nYes. I've never looked at it that way, Chris. And I can only say that we've never ever closed a store because of performance. The only reason we close stores is because either a better location becomes available or the shopping center is redoing itself and wants us out for a period of time and then wants us back in when they finish their renovations. But we've never closed a store. But to answer your question directly, I've never looked at it that way, showing me my -- the worst-performing. And -- so I can't answer your question legitimately. Thank you.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Perry Caicco (Analysts)】\nYou said that in anticipation of the changing FX rates, you made some changes to your merchandising programs. Can you tell us exactly the kinds of changes that you made?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nWell, not exactly. That would take too long. But in the process of that, Perry, is that, as you know, we hedge out anywhere between 6 months to a year so that the buyers, when they commit, know at what currency they are committing to. But knowing that the currency continues to increase and that eventually, your hedge cost, if the currencies stabilize, finishes by reaching the level of the currency that we see today, the spot rate. So in anticipation of that, you don't want to modify your prices every 6 months, so you set the price point and the return in considering that future cost that's going to be a factor in determining the return. So that's basically it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Perry Caicco (Analysts)】\nAnd did you make these changes before the quarter or during the quarter?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nDuring the quarter.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nNo. Well it's done before. The commitments are made before. You receive the goods afterwards and when you start receiving and you start selling them. But because you paid them at a hedged rate, which is lower than the spot that's coming up or the hedge rate that we will have in the future, you already have that activity going on.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Perry Caicco (Analysts)】\nAnd do you expect to do more of this in the next couple of months?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nYes. As you all know, we have that visibility and that's how we look at it.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nBut it will come to an end.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nBut it comes to an end. I mean, it's a timing. Because of the sharp increase -- you haven't seen that in the past because you didn't have any sharp increase. So it just melted in. Whereas now, you had a sharp increase in the currency. And so you forecast that and you take it into account when you determine the mix and the return on your products.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Perry Caicco (Analysts)】\nOkay. And on a slightly different topic, the 6.2% increase in transaction size, was that mostly higher-priced items in the basket? Or were there more items in the basket?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nYes. We don't disclose the content of the basket. But obviously, the price has -- the higher price point penetration has an impact.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Perry Caicco (Analysts)】\nOkay. And my last question. I'm just wondering how you're offsetting the minimum wage increases this year and how concerned are you about minimum wage increases over the next year or so?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nWe're -- I mean, the biggest impact was last year with the Ontario increase. Now it's lower, so we're not -- we don't have major concerns as to the -- any major increase. Well, this year, we know it, and next year, we don't anticipate major increase.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Irene Nattel (Analysts)】\nSorry to continue to beat this horse, but I just want to make sure that I'm understanding what you're saying. So you don't want to keep raising or adjusting your price points. So let's just say there's a certain gardening tool that you have the benefit of buying with the currency hedged at a higher price. You introduced it this summer at $2, but you know that looking out, it would have to be at $2.20 or $2.50 in order to protect your margins. So you just introduce it at $2.50 so that it will be the same price. Is that kind of what we're talking about here?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nIt's -- I mean, yes, it's not necessarily a markup. It's -- we refresh 25% to 30% of the items. So it could be new items coming in. And where you say exactly, the logic is there. I mean, you're right. So you know that the cost of the currency is going to go up 3 months later because you hedge out, but the spreads get tighter and tighter or higher and higher as you move out. So you know that, eventually, you're going to catch up to the 1 25 or whatever level it is. But it's higher than the hedged rate. So in anticipation of that, obviously, you take that into account and you factor it into your price point and the item that you're presenting.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nYes. Let me give -- get another -- give you another crack at that question. Let's say at one point, the spot was 1 25 and you're hedged at 1 08, well, the buyers are looking at, certainly I am, are looking more at the 1 25 than the 1 08. So we're costing at -- whether it's a new item or an old item. We're costing at that 1 25. We're -- so our retail prices indicate that margin of costing, yet our spot is at 1 08 or 1 10 or at 1 12. So that difference is creating that difference in the margins.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Irene Nattel (Analysts)】\nThat's very helpful, Larry. So just continuing on with the subject of FX. On the last call, you said that at this point in time, there are no plans to introduce higher price points but that if the dollar continues to weaken, that could be something that you would look at in future. Could you update us on your current thinking?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nNow Irene, who said that? Okay, I did. You're right, you're right. Okay. So basically, we'll do nothing, like I said, for FY '16, nor would we do anything for Q1 and Q2. Now for Q3 and Q4, I think we'll get a better indication from our trip to the Orient in October. And the new price points, if indeed we decide to go that way, would be $3.50 and $4. But we will at all times maintain, and that's important to note, a maximum price point on foodstuffs at $2. So foodstuffs will continue as they have to maintain the $2 price point. Now what are we going to find out in the Orient? Well, we'll probably find that prices, generally speaking, are stable. I don't think we may get the occasional discount for that devaluation of the renminbi, but not always because they've hedged out and they claim that they can't give us that 2%. Now 2% is meaningless compared to the 30% we've lost in the Canadian dollar, and we should remember that more than anything else. So what are we going to see in the Orient? Well, we're certainly not going to be able to solve the Canadian dollar versus the American dollar decrease or the weakening of the Canadian dollar. But in different areas, we may have to treat the retail prices in different ways. That we may see. But the probability is in Q3 and Q4 of next year, we'll have to move our price points up. That would be the probability. But I think the clarity we're going to see when we make our trip in October will give us a little bit more, well, confidence as to the fact that we're doing the right thing. We'd be doing the right thing. I just don't like -- in general, we like to maintain our prices as long as we can, but this is really an exceptional time where the Canadian dollar has gone so poorly against the U.S. dollar and everything is bought in U.S. dollars. So we -- to absorb 25% to 35% is almost impossible. So go ahead, Irene.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Irene Nattel (Analysts)】\nI was going to say that's extremely helpful, Larry.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nOkay. Anything else?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Irene Nattel (Analysts)】\nJust one last question, if I may, which goes to performance across the country. Are you seeing any weakness at all in the oil-producing regions, even in micro markets like Fort McMurray?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nWell, we're not going to open a store in Fort McMurray, and we are not seeing -- I could get a better rental rate there than I did about 1 year or 2 ago. Having said that, we don't have any plans to go to Fort McMurray. But that was an example you're using. We're not seeing what -- to answer your question, we're not seeing any of that as far as our sales go. So I think our sales are pretty consistent across the country.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nYes, that's the case.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nI mean, where we have more mature -- even where we have more mature markets like Ontario and Québec, we're seeing some nice increases in both those markets. So it's pretty steady across the country.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kenric Tyghe (Analysts)】\nMichael, you have raised your in-year gross margin guidance higher, but I noticed you're maintaining your line of the 16.5% to 17% on G&A. Could you give us some indication or just discuss what it is that sort of keeps your cautious guide on G&A despite the traction of these initiatives? You've highlighted there's not any major wage inflation expected down the pipe. Certainly, a lot of the initiatives appear to be tracking very well. Could you sort of walk us through sort of how and why that line is being held?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nYes, well, I mean, generally...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nWe would say very poorly.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nYes. The reason is, as we get into Q3, Q4, we're against bigger same-store sales. Last year, Q3 was 5.9 and Q4, 8.5, in terms of scaling. And I think the range is large enough that we're still comfortable with what we gave out last quarter and it just hasn't changed. So I mean, it's -- those are the, principally, the elements that we look at when we give out the guidance.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kenric Tyghe (Analysts)】\nFair enough. And just one other quick question. Just in terms of the competitive intensity and specifically Western Canada, have you noticed any change with perhaps a competitor of yours being -- competitor or 2 of yours being a little distracted or otherwise? And could you sort of just speak to the Western Canadian competitive intensity more broadly?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nWell, I -- out west, they're certainly -- if you're talking about Dollar Tree, they certainly are there. I'm not counting the number of stores they're opening or closing. There is more competition out west with Dollar Tree being there. They have about 200 stores and they're all from Ontario West. But our numbers show that across the country they're about the same. So...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nYes. I think you're right, Larry.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nI don't know what to add besides that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nThere is no -- I mean, the -- if we look at -- what we do is from coast-to-coast in every province or region, we have reports on how the stores do compared to the chain and compared to the previous years. And there's no real movement going on, whether it's BC, Alberta, Newfoundland, Québec, Ontario. So it's pretty steady across. The competitive landscape is a bit different out west. That's where you have, for instance, most of the dollar store chains, the other 4 dollar store chains, including Dollar Tree. But in essence, there's not more going out -- going on out west than there is out east.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nBut Kenric, if I were Dollar Tree and I just took over 8,000 stores in the states, I would be distracted, I can say that. I would be, but maybe they're not, but I would be. It's quite a challenge.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Durran (Analysts)】\nSo sorry to stay with the same issues, but it's obviously what we're all focused on. So I understand what you've done in terms of moving price up to keep it simple for the consumer and maybe gaining some gross margin temporarily in advance. When you look into the next year and the first half of the year, are you concerned that you'll just, by natural progression of COGS, see gross margin deteriorate and that's why you're maintaining your guidance for next year? Or is the 36% to 37% -- yes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nYes. Absolutely. I mean, it's as simple as that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nYes, you hit it on the nail.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nOne of the factors that's going to kick in, in F '17 is the increased cost of the currency. And that's going to impact my margin down and back into the 36% to 37% range.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Durran (Analysts)】\nHow much proactivity have you been able to apply to changing the actual nature of the product as a way of containing the cost of goods sold inflation? Has that been a real focus for you? Or has it been more just trying to figure out what items you can take price up on?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nWell, I think nothing has changed. In other words, we continue to replenish 25% to 30% of our items year-round. And the example Larry gave is dead-on accurate. So you tell the buyer, \"Here's the short-term hedge rate,\" when we're actually going to pay. But here's the 3, 6 months later hedge rate, if we are hedged, or the spot if we're not, and that's what we'll have to deal with. So do we increase it once now and back 3 months later? I don't think so. So the buyer just takes into account the 1 25 in the example that Larry gave out earlier instead of the 1 08. And the buyers just buy and select with that in mind, with that factor in mind. That's all. Nothing in the process or in the flow changes. It's just the discussion as to the timing of the currency and what currency you take.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nYes. So Michael, I think it's a combination of both. You said it. It's a combination of where you can change packaging. I mean, if you have a food container, it's one food container. You can't make a half a food container. You can make it smaller, but if you want to have that size food container, you have to make a decision whether to make your markup on it or not. Where -- if you have a package of 20 pencils and you decide to go to 15, well, that's another decision. And that's been going on for a long time. It could have gone from 10 to 20 when the dollar was going the other way. So we're always playing with that dynamic. And depending where the dollar -- it's a lot more uncomfortable going the way the dollar's been going, obviously. We like to give better value. But the value is relative to the rest of the country, and the rest of the country has to do the same thing, all the rest of the retailers. So as a consumer, I guess next year will not be a pleasant year from a purchasing point of view because you'll probably be seeing some inflation in all likelihood or getting 15 pencils instead of 20. But that's life. I mean, people understand or should understand that if you lose 1/3 of your value of your -- or the value of your currency, well, if you travel to Florida, you have the same problem. So we're dealing with that on a daily basis. It's a struggle. You want to give value yet you have this squeeze on margins, which you guys are going to keep us to. So we're doing the best we can.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nBut again, we're all on the same level playing field, and it's been the model forever. And as long as your relative value to competition is better, that's what we're working towards.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Durran (Analysts)】\nYes. On the cost savings side, like a lot of talk about in-store initiatives. But I'm wondering about the distribution center. Like, are there chunky opportunities still on the DC? I mean, obviously, your revenue growth is providing a fair amount of leverage there. But is there cost reduction initiatives, further automation or other initiatives that we should be thinking about as you look into 2017 and beyond?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nYes. We -- and we have some going on now and have for the past year and which have contributed to the -- also to the reduction or the improvement of the margin this quarter, which can be palette optimization, delivery consolidation and things of that nature.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Durran (Analysts)】\nAnd to those -- from a dollar standpoint, though, do those pale in comparison to what we're seeing from a labor scheduling standpoint and what you think you'll get out of the WiFi deployment?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nNo. I think it's a slower and a smaller impact.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nYes. I -- we agree with you, Jim.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Durran (Analysts)】\nAnd new DC in Western Canada is still several years off if you continue to squeeze more productivity out of the existing facility?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nYes, yes. Again, that warehouse in DC out west depends on if it makes economic sense. In fact, with oil at its present rate or costs, it makes less sense every day. So if we're going to need, which will probably happen shortly, more space to run this business, whether it's DC or warehousing, we'll probably do it out east because that's what makes sense today by a long shot. It's -- and we have better controls by having it in Montreal, around us, and it's a whole other thing to go -- to have another warehouse out west. And if it makes huge economic sense, we'll do it, but it doesn't make any economic sense at the moment.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Peter Sklar (Analysts)】\nI just had a question about the -- there was an acceleration in the proportion of products that are priced at $1 or more. And I'm just wondering what the underlying dynamics of that are. Are you continuing to increase the mix of SKUs that are priced higher than $1? Or are just people buying more of existing higher-priced SKUs? Or just give some flavor on what's going on there because you did have quite a leap in that...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nI think it happens by default. When you're out buying today, and we're not talking 20 years ago, we're talking today, you're being offered less and less items that could sell for $1 to $1.25. So the tendency is for the buyers -- and you know subconsciously or consciously that you're being offered nicer products to sell for $2 and $3 and whatever. And you are going to, as a buyer, tend to move in that direction just -- not by design, but just out of human nature by saying -- and you're not being offered. And the stuff you're being offered at -- to sell for $1 to $1.25 is certainly not the value that you used to get 20 years ago. So almost by default, it's not by design. We're not saying we want to sell more product at the higher price points. My God, I say higher, relative to other retailers. Okay, we'll say higher. So I think it's just when you're out there selecting and being presented, whether you are there or here, you're always getting new items being offered, the likelihood for the buyer is to buy something that is nicer and more -- therefore more expensive, and therefore will increase your variety at the higher price points. To sell something at $1 today and $1.25, you've got to pay between $0.25 and $0.35. Well, China is not concentrating on that price level anymore. They're not concentrating like they used to 20 years ago. I mean, there was a huge concentration of effort and new molds and just items being created for that price point. That price point seems to, other than Dollar Tree in the states, have gone -- has gone away to a large extent. It's gone bye-bye. So I don't think we are by consciously saying we want to buy more items at $2.50 and $3, we just do. And I think that's the best answer unless someone around the table has a better answer. No. That's all you're getting for today on that one.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Peter Sklar (Analysts)】\nNo, that was a good explanation, Larry. Just is there any update on Dollar City? Or is it just kind of steady as she goes?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nSteady as she goes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nYes. We're happy with the progress.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Derek Dley (Analysts)】\nCan you just give us an update on some of your new cost initiatives like WiFi, for example, where are you guys at on that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nEssentially, we've got the antennas and the hardware set up. There's still connections to do, programming to do and a lot of training to do. So that's why we only expect the benefits to kick in next year in the latter part. But everything is going on track, on budget and it's going very well.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Derek Dley (Analysts)】\nOkay. Great. And I think I asked you guys this on the last call, but just given the slowdown that we have seen in China, are you guys seeing any more sort of weakness in actual cost in China? I mean, obviously, the currency is going to offset a portion of that, but have we seen any other cost relent?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nNo. Again, it goes by your product category. But the answer is no. Just to maintain prices, what they're -- I mean, they're still dealing with the increases in labor costs. And all of a sudden, they say -- when you say, well, when oil is going up, they say, well, we have to increase the price of our plastics. But when that goes down, all of a sudden, oil is a small part of the product. So -- and how are you going to fight that? They are still the best source of supply. And I wish I could say that we're getting 10% decreases, but it's far from that. We're maintaining our costs or in certain categories, getting a bit of a break, but that break would be 2%, 3%. 5% at most. So generally speaking, it's business as usual in the sense that we're not getting price decreases, not nearly enough to compensate what's happening with our Canadian dollar here. Not in the same league.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Derek Dley (Analysts)】\nYes. Okay. Understood. And just regionally, were any areas stronger in terms of same-store sales this quarter or traffic?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nNo. Across the country, we're doing well across the country, thankfully. It's the same across the country.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Hartley (Analysts)】\nJust one question to round it all out. Your average traffic counts per store, how are they looking? I mean, has -- have you seen changes with that? I guess it's another cute way of getting at your basket size.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nYes. Well, yes. That sort of basket we don't disclose. And so traffic is, again, coast-to-coast and it's pretty stable. And yes, there's not much more we can say about that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nWe're happy. We're happy. We seem to be getting our share.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Hartley (Analysts)】\nFair enough. That's great. And store sizes, are you still planning to look at similar-sized stores on average as you continue to roll through 70, 80 stores per year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nWell, haven't you heard that we've taken over 30 Target stores?\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Hartley (Analysts)】\nNo.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nI'm just kidding you. I'm just kidding you. I'm just kidding. No, I think, still, 10,000 feet is ideal. It doesn't mean that if the opportunity presents itself, we won't go higher. And if the opportunity presents itself, we won't go down to, let's say, 6,000, 7,000 feet. It's more difficult to operate. But when you're in the middle of Toronto or the middle of Vancouver, we don't expect to be able to get 10,000-foot boxes that easily. So we usually take smaller-sized stores, which is okay. They usually have basements. So the operation is a little bit more costly, but it's okay. I don't know if I've answered your question.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Hartley (Analysts)】\nYes. It's all fine. I'm just wondering, last question. Could you remind me and all of us about where you're opening up stores over the coming 12 months, urban, suburban, rural, east, west, that kind of thing?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nYes. It's -- there's no direction. In other words, we don't say like we've got to open some urban stores. It's just that we're -- again, it's opportunity-driven. It's opportunity-driven across the country. It seems that as things turn out, that we're still opening 2/3 of our stores in Québec and Ontario. As densified as we think they are, they're still -- that's where the people are. And when we bring our stores to the people, they seem to react positively. The other areas are very -- the Maritimes and Newfoundland out west, they're very good areas for us. But at the end of the day, it's still about 2/3 Québec and Canada -- Québec and Ontario.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Hartley (Analysts)】\nOkay. Let me sneak one more in. Just given this is a bit of, I'll call it, a windfall year, argue against that if you will, but given your gross margin gains this year, temporary as they may be, but would that suggest to all of us that your buybacks will perhaps increase year-over-year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nThat's -- yes, I mean, the -- in terms of buyback, the approach is the same, opportunistic. And the intention, as it has been for the past programs, is to continue buying back shares.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Vishal Shreedhar (Analysts)】\nI just wanted to jump back quickly to the gross margin and, as was said a few times before, I understand there's a transient benefit on product margin related to pricing. But in the disclosure materials, it says the increase was slightly higher product margin. So -- and your gross margin rate year-over-year was a pretty strong increase. So just wondering, how large were the other factors like the scaling and logistics and the transportation costs? Are those meaningful drivers of the benefit?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nYes. And the importance, without even going into too much detail, it's the markup had the bigger impact and the transport had a good impact also. And then you've got scaling and other smaller factors.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Vishal Shreedhar (Analysts)】\nGot it. So the transportation benefit, I should presumed that sticks and that's somewhat related to the price of oil?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nI'm sorry, Vishal. I have problems hearing you.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Vishal Shreedhar (Analysts)】\nSorry. Can you hear me better now?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Vishal Shreedhar (Analysts)】\nOkay. The transportation benefit, presumably that sticks and it's related to the price of oil?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nYes. A part yes. Yes?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Vishal Shreedhar (Analysts)】\nOkay. And just lastly, on the Latin American expansion, just a quick reminder here. Is the business model to be designed to be similar to Dollarama in terms of economics? I know it's early days here, but I was just trying to understand.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nYes. The business model, first, it's to replicate the Dollarama concept. So as we've always said, if we drop you in a store there, you'd think you're in a Dollarama store. And hopefully -- obviously, it's very small now, so you don't get the scaling benefits in terms of KPIs. But the intention is to make it an operation that has very strong margins over the long term.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nOkay, yes. Don't forget where we have smaller stores there. We don't -- we can't find 10,000-foot stores in that area. So you're dealing with stores between 2,000 and 4,000, 5,000 feet. And your labor is less expensive, so you're able to supply those stores more regularly and spend more money on supply because I think you just don't see -- you don't have the size stores to put your assortment in. So the assortment has to be better managed and better managed physically, which they do. They do very well. They have done very well. And we've just opened a few more stores or our first stores in Guatemala as a second country in Central America, just for your interest, which you -- yes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Keith Howlett (Analysts)】\nI just wanted to ask on your China purchases. Are they all made in U.S. dollars? Or do you have any contracts with suppliers in renminbi?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nFor the moment, it's all in U.S. dollars, and we're evaluating renminbi.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Keith Howlett (Analysts)】\nAnd then I was wondering on the freight. Your buyers seem to be expert at the forward curve of currency, but I'm just wondering on freight, do you give them a freight factor to include in their gross margin that you provide them? Or how do they adjust...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nYes. Well, the system provides for that. So it's -- we have landed, including freight and other factors.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nYes. The freight advantages, and correct me if I'm wrong, Michael, the freight advantages are coming from domestic transportation, not from -- we haven't had a serious freight decrease.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nNo. No, no, you're right. That's outbound transport where we need to chain [ph] the freight -- I guess you're talking about freight-in, Keith?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Keith Howlett (Analysts)】\nWell, I was wondering both freight-in and freight domestically, whether your -- that's part of your buyers' calculation.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nYes. Absolutely.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Keith Howlett (Analysts)】\nSo do you give them the number that you're anticipating freight will be and they build that in? And then if freight's less that, that sort of is -- boosts their performance in their category?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nYes. When we look at gross margin, the 36% to 37%, logistics is a component definitely. The currency, the freight-in, outbound transport, all of that is part of it. So if we anticipate that the gross margin is going to go up because of a better outbound transport and/or logistics, we let the buyers know so that they understand that it's going to improve the margin and they can certainly factor that in when they're buying.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nWe don't sleep very well with all this information, I'll tell you.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Keith Howlett (Analysts)】\nYes. Well certainly, the numbers are working so far. And just on the Target stores, I know you were joking, but I ran into a story recently where the -- an old Zellers had been carved up in 4 pieces and you are 1 piece and there was a Winners and another piece. Are there many opportunities like that? Or are they very one-off-ish?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nGod, I wish there were more. Those are the old Zellers. Those are the stores that were not taken by Target. The ones selected by Target were obviously the better locations, and location had nothing to do with their failing, in my opinion. So we do have some, some, old Zellers that were not taken by Target. Some of them have been, by the developer, have been cut up. Where were you looking at?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Keith Howlett (Analysts)】\nHuntsville.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nYes, Huntsville. Okay. Yes, so we made that move. We didn't put a second store in Huntsville, we simply moved locations to what we thought was a better location, that one being in the Zellers. Some opportunities have come up like that, maybe 2, 3 of them. Some opportunities have come up with respect to carving up the former Targets also. And I think more will come about, but it doesn't mean an extra store, unfortunately. It probably means relocating one of our existing stores into what we feel would be a better location. It has happened. But when you have a 1,000 stores, you're looking at 3, 4 of them.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Keith Howlett (Analysts)】\nRight. And just finally, how does the back-to-school merchandise assortment look? And if you have any comments on the results there.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nNeil, do you have anything to say on back-to-school in July, Neil?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Neil Rossy (Executives)】\nNo. It was in line with last year. We were happy with the results.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Brian Morrison (Analysts)】\nJust 2 quick questions, if I can. First, when you talk about the introduction potentially of $3.50 and $4 price points, would you keep the same number of items? Like, if you have 7 price points right now, would you keep the same number of price points? Or would that be in addition to, do you think?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nIt would be in addition to.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Brian Morrison (Analysts)】\nOkay. And the second question, I understand your gross margin is going to normalize back to the 36% to 37% range as the hedges kick in. But just to go one step further. If the dollar were to decline, going forward a couple of years, to $1.15, prices are now adjusted for current spot rates. Would you still target a 36% to 37% gross margin? Or would that be an opportunity to have the value proposition potentially be at a higher gross margin or in your example earlier, go to $0.17...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nI would like that to happen and then we'll give some serious thought to it. I just can't speculate that way at this moment. In the past, we've given better value when the Canadian dollar was improving versus the U.S. dollar. We tended to give it. But to speculate what will happen if it became $1.15 and it's not $1.30 any longer, I don't know. Things happening in China. Where will China be? Where will oil, where will fuel be? To speculate that far out, I just don't -- I wouldn't like to do that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nBut again, Brian, we'll be all on the same level playing field as others. So I mean, it's always -- you're always comparing and managing it relative to others too.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Brian Morrison (Analysts)】\nYes. I guess the point is if you can throw up robust numbers at $1.30, you potentially have an opportunity at $1.15.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nRight.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nYou can conclude that. I would conclude that, if I were you. But I don't know how -- what things will be like when that happens and if that happens. And hopefully, that happens because it's a lot easier to manage $1.15 than $1.30 or $1.35.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nIn other words, it's not an automatic gross margin benefit. You adjust to competition.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chris Li (Analysts)】\nJust as you contemplate introducing new higher price points, will most of the additional SKUs be used to expand your -- the assortment of the existing categories? Or do you see it as an opportunity to perhaps get into new categories that you're presently not providing?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nNo. I do not see it as a means of introducing new categories. It's just within the existing categories. We -- no. That is the answer. It's existing categories. Absolutely.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chris Li (Analysts)】\nOkay. And I think it sounds like as you contemplate higher price points, it would suggest that your confidence in your ability to preserve the value proposition for the consumer at the higher price point will still be preserved. How do you kind of balance that against the risk that -- of that not being able to achieve -- analyzing the value proposition with the customers as you go...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nI think we -- at the higher price points, we hope we can give the same value that we give at every other price point. And we're going to make sure we do that. I can only say that much for that question. I think at $3.50 and $4, we'll be able to give value, the same values as we gave in every other single -- every other price point. And again, we're competing on the same playing field as everybody else in Canada. So that should be the case.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chris Li (Analysts)】\nGot you. Okay. And my last question is when you look at your same-store sales growth performance, if you look at, say, the bottom 25% of your stores, how is the comp store sales growth relative to your company average? I just want to get a sense of what the variance is between your worst-performing stores versus the company average.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nNo, we don't go into that detail, Chris. But essentially, as we said in the past, they all contribute and it's pretty much all well bunched up.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nYes. I've never looked at it that way, Chris. And I can only say that we've never ever closed a store because of performance. The only reason we close stores is because either a better location becomes available or the shopping center is redoing itself and wants us out for a period of time and then wants us back in when they finish their renovations. But we've never closed a store. But to answer your question directly, I've never looked at it that way, showing me my -- the worst-performing. And -- so I can't answer your question legitimately. Thank you.",

      "transcript_text3": "Just one question then on the gross margin. I wonder what your expectations are for the full year now, given the slightly stronger performance in the first half and also a very strong start to Zumiez full price sales in Q3.\n\n---\n\nWell, thank you very much. First of all, what I would say is that we are very satisfied with the evolution of the gross margin in the first half of the year. And as you know and we always say that gross margin needs a combination of many different factors: fashion trends, product mix, like-for-like, markups, markdowns, product management, the comparables, so there many things involved in the gross margin. I think something which is very relevant talking about Inditex is that our model is highly flexible, and it provides a strong stability to the gross margin. This is why we always talk about the stable gross margins, knowing that, for us, stable means plus/minus 50 basis points. So what I can tell you about the gross margin for the full year is very similar to what we were saying in June in the first quarter results publication, that we are expecting a stable gross margin for the full year, knowing that, for us, stable means plus/minus 50 basis points. And that this year, the growth of gross margin will be probably a bit higher in the first half and a bit lower in the second half, given the evolution of the U.S. dollar/euro exchange rate. But I think what is very relevant is that, globally, a stable gross margin for the full year.\n\n---\n\nOkay. I mean, for Inditex, I guess the second half is more important than the first half. So should we assume that the full year might be towards the lower end of a stable, given the dollar/euro effect coming through in the second half? Or will that be offset by the stronger full price sales trend?\n\n---\n\nYou know that the gross margin, as I was saying at the beginning, is a combination of many different things. So you look up your mathematics. That is why when we talk about stable, we always say plus/minus 50 basis points. And this is what we expected for this year, a stable gross margin for the full year, understanding that, for us, stable means plus/minus 50 basis points. So as I was telling you before, you know that, for us, we have 2/3 of our sales first in euro-denominated, 1/3 in dollar-denominated. So given the evolution of the U.S. dollar/euro exchange rate, the gross margin would be a bit higher in the first half and a bit lower in the second half. But as I was saying to you before, normally, we are expecting a stable gross margin for the full year. And of course, as you were saying in your question, we can say that we are satisfied with the start of the season, very strong start of the season in all the different geographies, in all the different concepts. But as we always say, we're only talking about the first 6 weeks of the season, and we have the full season in front of us. But what we can say is that we have had a positive start of the season.\n\n---\n\nWere there any special impacts or explanations for the strength of sales in the 1st of August to 10th of September period, please? And in particular, were there increased markdowns during that period?\n\n---\n\nNo, no, nothing to do with the final part of your question, nothing at all to do with that. You have seen that we have increased the gross margin in the first half of the year, so nothing to do with that. No, we have had a very -- I think I was saying to you before, it's a strong start of the season in all the different geographies, in all the different brands. So this is what we can say. It's a combination of everything. Of course, everything is based on the flexibility of our business model, and many of our collections have been quite well received by our customers, so a strong start of the season. It's a combination of everything, this full integrated approach between the stores and online, so that is what we can say. You know that we always say that we prefer not to extrapolate in a short period of time for the full season, but this is what is behind that. Of course, as always, our like-for-like sales growth is volume-driven. This is always the case, and it continues being the case.\n\n---\n\nJust my question is on online. Given it's clearly quite a big growth driver, can you give us a sense of now where it is as a percentage of sales and how much of your like-for-like growth is coming from the online sales? And are you seeing any cannibalization in your stores where you've launched online geographically?\n\n---\n\nWell, when you say the strong like-for-like sales growth, it's difficult to talk about cannibalization from any point of view. If you think about the first half, we have achieved 7% like-for-like sales growth; and  in first half 2014, it was 4.5%. So it's 7% on top of 4.5%, so it's difficult to talk about cannibalization. What we can tell you is that, for us, what is very, very relevant is this fully integrated approach. This approach, considering stores and online, you know that from the very beginning, we have believed very much in this fully integrated approach, the possibility of having a store delivery, seeing a store replenish, ordering online from the stores. For our customers, well this is the case. And for us, it's very important. Online sales, that is also very important. The number of visits to that area remains growing to our own different online pages and apps with the different brands. So with this fully integrated approach. The same customers see the products [ph] online, sometimes they buy online, sometimes they go to the stores. Once they decide to buy online that they order, they ask for the in-store delivery or they go to the stores and they buy in the stores. So with this fully integrated approach is what is very relevant for us. We have millions of people visiting our online apps and web pages every day, so this is what we think is very strong. I'm answering specifically your question, we have not seen any type of cannibalization in the stores.\n\n---\n\nAnd will you be willing to give us your percentage of annualized sales now as a percentage from online? Can you give us that number?\n\n---\n\nNo, because we see this as a fully integrated approach between stores and online, so that is why we prefer not to specify which part comes from where.\n\n---\n\nAnd can you just quickly explain why there is such a contraction in receivables and perhaps give us what constant-currency inventory growth was, given that there's quite a significant sort of negative growth in capital base at the end of the first half?\n\n---\n\nYes, Rebecca, it's a very technical question, but  recent change in the VAT regulation that allows to net the payments to a capital contribution [indiscernible] have nothing to do with us. Earlier  you're talking about the inventory, as you can see, inventory is very tightly knit as well. You see that the working capital is working according to our business model, negative working capital, and the lines are working very much in line with the business.\n\n---\n\nLike I said it's not just the timing issue that should carry through to the full year, should it?\n\n---\n\nWell, they  say, it's a minor issue. You see that the mechanics of the working capital remain very much in line with evolution of the business.\n\n---\n\nA question on FX evolution. According to my estimates and looking at the main currencies, evolution FX, you have more or less 1.5 negative contribution in Q3, at least up until now and assuming basically the same trends going forward. Do you confirm this figure? And what is your view for the full year?\n\n---\n\nOn that question what I would like to say before answering your question in that area, as, we have said in many different times, the way we operate our business, we are not paying so much attention to currencies at any particular moment because when we are presenting a market, and we believe in this market and the growth potential of the market, we are always thinking about the medium and the long term in that market. It is our approach to the way we manage the business because when we are presenting a [indiscernible] different market, every year, there are ups and downs in terms of currency, so we are not particularly upset with the evolution of currencies. Having said that, what we were saying during the presentation is that at current exchange rates for the full year, we are expecting around 0.5% positive impact on sales coming from currencies.\n\n---\n\nJust a quick one from myself. There's been quite a step-up in the profit contribution year-on-year from Tempe group. I'm assuming it is within the consolidation there. Is there anything in particular we should be thinking about, and particularly with regards to looking at the second half, what profit contribution we might be expecting, given the seasonality of the business?\n\n---\n\nYes. Thank you for your question. Basically, the  -- it's not very much for us to give guidance in the second half or in quarter month. But I believe the contribution of Tempe very much in line with the performance of the Inditex group because, as you know, these are the supplier of shoes and accessories for most of the group. So I'm not going to give you any details ahead of that. I would agree, the performance of Tempe very much in line with the performance of Inditex.\n\n---\n\nOkay. So the seasonality we saw last year in terms of first half, second half contribution, we should be expecting something more stable or the kind of year-on-year growth should be our start point?\n\n---\n\nSimon, I think it has nothing to [ph] it should be going  very much in line with the top line performance of Inditex than anything else.\n\n---\n\nCould you just talk a little bit more about store growth? Obviously, first half net store growth was relatively low. If you could just give us your expectation for the full year, maybe what the gross number as well as the net number was. And related to that, there were press reports in Spain about the slowdown of store growth in China, and I was wondering if you could respond to that.\n\n---\n\nWell, the first thing I would say is that, of course, as we were saying in the presentation, our space growth plan remains on track. It always has something to do with the calendar of openings when you see it in a particular moment. The calendar of openings and also the calendar, I would say, of absorptions because the calendar of openings have absorptions. In terms of net openings, we maintain the figure that we were providing at the beginning of the year, between 320 and 380 net openings [indiscernible] for date of the year. Let's for example, we give you some color about this, at September 15, net openings were already 150 net openings. So it has a lot to do with the calendar of openings. This year, there will be many openings concentrated in the months of September and October. And then you were mentioning about China. Of course, in any particular market, particularly when there is some marketing, which growth has a lot to do with shopping mall development and it could be any particular year, 1, 2, 3 shopping malls that could move from 1 year to another. Having said that, we expect a significant number of openings in China this year and in the coming years. Our business in China remains quite strong, very positive like-for-like sales growth in the country. And we continue seeing a strong growth opportunity with all our different brands in the Chinese market. So answering your question, it has more to do with the calendar of openings than with anything else.\n\n---\n\nI was just wondering if you could provide a more detailed split of the 7% like-for-like between volume and value. I know you said it's predominantly volume, just wondering if there was a country or brand price/mix effect in there as well.\n\n---\n\nNo. What I would tell you is that, broadly, our prices have remained stable in the different markets, so it's volume driven. And we have had very strong performance in all the different geographies and among the different brands. So it is very, I would say, very well split across all  the different geographies and all across the different brands. So we have achieved positive like-for-like sales growth in -- all across the company, I would think.\n\n---\n\nYou seem to have outperformed some big competitors, especially in August. Could you maybe tell us if you saw any acceleration in September versus August? And how did your Continental European business behave in August?\n\n---\n\nAnd what I would tell you is that, as you know, we don't like to elaborate very much on a very short period of time, so then even late to elaborate very much on a part of a very short period of time. So what I would say is that this is just the start of the season, and we have had a strong impact of the season, but that's it. I wouldn't like to enter into more details about the trading update.\n\n---\n\nDid you see stronger growth in emerging markets than in Continental Europe?\n\n---\n\nI must say I would tell you the same. I don't want to enter into more specifics about such a short period of time.\n\n---\n\nGood morning. We have a number of webcast questions. The first of which relates to, \"Can you comment on  current trading in the Spanish market, please?\"\n\n---\n\nWell, what I would say is that, as you know, we don't like to elaborate very much on any specific market. But what we  can tell you is that our trading in the Spanish market is quite positive. In fact, in the first half of the year, we have achieved a 6.3% sales growth, having in mind that in the first half of the previous year, we already have achieved 6% sales growth. So we are having a positive evolution of our sales in the Spanish market and that we'll continue being very active with newer stores, enlargement of existing stores. So we operate in the marketing, as I was saying in previous presentations, in very, very normal conditions and with positive sales growth.\n\n---\n\nGoing on to the next question, there are a number of questions of the -- on the current -- on the increase in the cash position, if you could provide some comments.\n\n---\n\nWell, it shows -- it has a lot to do with the execution of our business model and with the global performance of the company in the first half. And in terms of the use of cash, as you know, that our first priority is to invest in the long-term profitable growth of the company and to combine this with an attractive and predictable shareholder remuneration policy. This is what we are doing. We have more than doubled the dividend in the last 5 years, and this is what we plan to continue doing. In any case, we always update about the dividends in the full year results  presentation in the month of March.\n\n---\n\nThere has been a couple of questions surrounding CapEx, notably the CapEx guidance for the coming year.\n\n---\n\nYes. We maintain the guidance, around EUR 1.35 billion. And we sure anticipate that sometime ago, you should expect CapEx growth to be below space growth because in the coming years, the most growth of our CapEx has to do with the store openings and the store refurbishments, and then we have the CapEx which has to do with logistics, I think. And in the next few years, we are not thinking about big, big, big logistic investments. So that is why we should expect CapEx growth below space growth. So -- and for the year, that is the guidance we gave you at the beginning of the year.\n\n---\n\nThank you. One final question, \"Would you be able to comment on the recent launches in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau?\"\n\n---\n\nI would say very warm welcome as in other markets where we have begun our online operations. It was very important to be present in these markets for us, to continue completing our online presence in Asia. So our approach, as I was saying before, is this full integrated approach between our stores and online, and this is why we are rolling out our online presence in more and more markets. We will continue doing that in the coming years.\n\n---\n\nThank you very much, and we look forward to speaking to you again soon. And that wraps up our Q&A session.\n\n---\n\nThank you very much. And in any case, of course, as always, if you have more questions, I will address  them through our Capital Markets Department. Thank you very much.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Richard Chamberlain (Analysts)】\nJust one question then on the gross margin. I wonder what your expectations are for the full year now, given the slightly stronger performance in the first half and also a very strong start to Zumiez full price sales in Q3.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nWell, thank you very much. First of all, what I would say is that we are very satisfied with the evolution of the gross margin in the first half of the year. And as you know and we always say that gross margin needs a combination of many different factors: fashion trends, product mix, like-for-like, markups, markdowns, product management, the comparables, so there many things involved in the gross margin. I think something which is very relevant talking about Inditex is that our model is highly flexible, and it provides a strong stability to the gross margin. This is why we always talk about the stable gross margins, knowing that, for us, stable means plus/minus 50 basis points. So what I can tell you about the gross margin for the full year is very similar to what we were saying in June in the first quarter results publication, that we are expecting a stable gross margin for the full year, knowing that, for us, stable means plus/minus 50 basis points. And that this year, the growth of gross margin will be probably a bit higher in the first half and a bit lower in the second half, given the evolution of the U.S. dollar/euro exchange rate. But I think what is very relevant is that, globally, a stable gross margin for the full year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Richard Chamberlain (Analysts)】\nOkay. I mean, for Inditex, I guess the second half is more important than the first half. So should we assume that the full year might be towards the lower end of a stable, given the dollar/euro effect coming through in the second half? Or will that be offset by the stronger full price sales trend?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nYou know that the gross margin, as I was saying at the beginning, is a combination of many different things. So you look up your mathematics. That is why when we talk about stable, we always say plus/minus 50 basis points. And this is what we expected for this year, a stable gross margin for the full year, understanding that, for us, stable means plus/minus 50 basis points. So as I was telling you before, you know that, for us, we have 2/3 of our sales first in euro-denominated, 1/3 in dollar-denominated. So given the evolution of the U.S. dollar/euro exchange rate, the gross margin would be a bit higher in the first half and a bit lower in the second half. But as I was saying to you before, normally, we are expecting a stable gross margin for the full year. And of course, as you were saying in your question, we can say that we are satisfied with the start of the season, very strong start of the season in all the different geographies, in all the different concepts. But as we always say, we're only talking about the first 6 weeks of the season, and we have the full season in front of us. But what we can say is that we have had a positive start of the season.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Anne Critchlow (Analysts)】\nWere there any special impacts or explanations for the strength of sales in the 1st of August to 10th of September period, please? And in particular, were there increased markdowns during that period?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nNo, no, nothing to do with the final part of your question, nothing at all to do with that. You have seen that we have increased the gross margin in the first half of the year, so nothing to do with that. No, we have had a very -- I think I was saying to you before, it's a strong start of the season in all the different geographies, in all the different brands. So this is what we can say. It's a combination of everything. Of course, everything is based on the flexibility of our business model, and many of our collections have been quite well received by our customers, so a strong start of the season. It's a combination of everything, this full integrated approach between the stores and online, so that is what we can say. You know that we always say that we prefer not to extrapolate in a short period of time for the full season, but this is what is behind that. Of course, as always, our like-for-like sales growth is volume-driven. This is always the case, and it continues being the case.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Steegers (Analysts)】\nJust my question is on online. Given it's clearly quite a big growth driver, can you give us a sense of now where it is as a percentage of sales and how much of your like-for-like growth is coming from the online sales? And are you seeing any cannibalization in your stores where you've launched online geographically?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nWell, when you say the strong like-for-like sales growth, it's difficult to talk about cannibalization from any point of view. If you think about the first half, we have achieved 7% like-for-like sales growth; and  in first half 2014, it was 4.5%. So it's 7% on top of 4.5%, so it's difficult to talk about cannibalization. What we can tell you is that, for us, what is very, very relevant is this fully integrated approach. This approach, considering stores and online, you know that from the very beginning, we have believed very much in this fully integrated approach, the possibility of having a store delivery, seeing a store replenish, ordering online from the stores. For our customers, well this is the case. And for us, it's very important. Online sales, that is also very important. The number of visits to that area remains growing to our own different online pages and apps with the different brands. So with this fully integrated approach. The same customers see the products [ph] online, sometimes they buy online, sometimes they go to the stores. Once they decide to buy online that they order, they ask for the in-store delivery or they go to the stores and they buy in the stores. So with this fully integrated approach is what is very relevant for us. We have millions of people visiting our online apps and web pages every day, so this is what we think is very strong. I'm answering specifically your question, we have not seen any type of cannibalization in the stores.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Steegers (Analysts)】\nAnd will you be willing to give us your percentage of annualized sales now as a percentage from online? Can you give us that number?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nNo, because we see this as a fully integrated approach between stores and online, so that is why we prefer not to specify which part comes from where.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rebecca McClellan (Analysts)】\nAnd can you just quickly explain why there is such a contraction in receivables and perhaps give us what constant-currency inventory growth was, given that there's quite a significant sort of negative growth in capital base at the end of the first half?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ignacio Izuzquiza Fernández (Executives)】\nYes, Rebecca, it's a very technical question, but  recent change in the VAT regulation that allows to net the payments to a capital contribution [indiscernible] have nothing to do with us. Earlier  you're talking about the inventory, as you can see, inventory is very tightly knit as well. You see that the working capital is working according to our business model, negative working capital, and the lines are working very much in line with the business.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rebecca McClellan (Analysts)】\nLike I said it's not just the timing issue that should carry through to the full year, should it?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ignacio Izuzquiza Fernández (Executives)】\nWell, they  say, it's a minor issue. You see that the mechanics of the working capital remain very much in line with evolution of the business.\n\n---\n\n【質問: José Rito (Analysts)】\nA question on FX evolution. According to my estimates and looking at the main currencies, evolution FX, you have more or less 1.5 negative contribution in Q3, at least up until now and assuming basically the same trends going forward. Do you confirm this figure? And what is your view for the full year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nOn that question what I would like to say before answering your question in that area, as, we have said in many different times, the way we operate our business, we are not paying so much attention to currencies at any particular moment because when we are presenting a market, and we believe in this market and the growth potential of the market, we are always thinking about the medium and the long term in that market. It is our approach to the way we manage the business because when we are presenting a [indiscernible] different market, every year, there are ups and downs in terms of currency, so we are not particularly upset with the evolution of currencies. Having said that, what we were saying during the presentation is that at current exchange rates for the full year, we are expecting around 0.5% positive impact on sales coming from currencies.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Simon Bowler (Analysts)】\nJust a quick one from myself. There's been quite a step-up in the profit contribution year-on-year from Tempe group. I'm assuming it is within the consolidation there. Is there anything in particular we should be thinking about, and particularly with regards to looking at the second half, what profit contribution we might be expecting, given the seasonality of the business?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ignacio Izuzquiza Fernández (Executives)】\nYes. Thank you for your question. Basically, the  -- it's not very much for us to give guidance in the second half or in quarter month. But I believe the contribution of Tempe very much in line with the performance of the Inditex group because, as you know, these are the supplier of shoes and accessories for most of the group. So I'm not going to give you any details ahead of that. I would agree, the performance of Tempe very much in line with the performance of Inditex.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Simon Bowler (Analysts)】\nOkay. So the seasonality we saw last year in terms of first half, second half contribution, we should be expecting something more stable or the kind of year-on-year growth should be our start point?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ignacio Izuzquiza Fernández (Executives)】\nSimon, I think it has nothing to [ph] it should be going  very much in line with the top line performance of Inditex than anything else.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Simon Irwin (Analysts)】\nCould you just talk a little bit more about store growth? Obviously, first half net store growth was relatively low. If you could just give us your expectation for the full year, maybe what the gross number as well as the net number was. And related to that, there were press reports in Spain about the slowdown of store growth in China, and I was wondering if you could respond to that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nWell, the first thing I would say is that, of course, as we were saying in the presentation, our space growth plan remains on track. It always has something to do with the calendar of openings when you see it in a particular moment. The calendar of openings and also the calendar, I would say, of absorptions because the calendar of openings have absorptions. In terms of net openings, we maintain the figure that we were providing at the beginning of the year, between 320 and 380 net openings [indiscernible] for date of the year. Let's for example, we give you some color about this, at September 15, net openings were already 150 net openings. So it has a lot to do with the calendar of openings. This year, there will be many openings concentrated in the months of September and October. And then you were mentioning about China. Of course, in any particular market, particularly when there is some marketing, which growth has a lot to do with shopping mall development and it could be any particular year, 1, 2, 3 shopping malls that could move from 1 year to another. Having said that, we expect a significant number of openings in China this year and in the coming years. Our business in China remains quite strong, very positive like-for-like sales growth in the country. And we continue seeing a strong growth opportunity with all our different brands in the Chinese market. So answering your question, it has more to do with the calendar of openings than with anything else.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Warwick Okines (Analysts)】\nI was just wondering if you could provide a more detailed split of the 7% like-for-like between volume and value. I know you said it's predominantly volume, just wondering if there was a country or brand price/mix effect in there as well.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nNo. What I would tell you is that, broadly, our prices have remained stable in the different markets, so it's volume driven. And we have had very strong performance in all the different geographies and among the different brands. So it is very, I would say, very well split across all  the different geographies and all across the different brands. So we have achieved positive like-for-like sales growth in -- all across the company, I would think.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Cedric Lecasble (Analysts)】\nYou seem to have outperformed some big competitors, especially in August. Could you maybe tell us if you saw any acceleration in September versus August? And how did your Continental European business behave in August?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nAnd what I would tell you is that, as you know, we don't like to elaborate very much on a very short period of time, so then even late to elaborate very much on a part of a very short period of time. So what I would say is that this is just the start of the season, and we have had a strong impact of the season, but that's it. I wouldn't like to enter into more details about the trading update.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Cedric Lecasble (Analysts)】\nDid you see stronger growth in emerging markets than in Continental Europe?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nI must say I would tell you the same.
